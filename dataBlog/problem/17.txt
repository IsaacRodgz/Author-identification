 my. feet. hurt. i raced, and i came in 5th because of my downhill mastery, but my feet now hurt with every step. god, i'm out of shape. and if anyone was curious, i have a blood blister on my toe. such fun.

 I see, everyone is too scared to respond to my perfection.

 WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!! Everyone seriously needs to download "You're the first, my last, my everything" by Barry White. This is the ultimate dancing song, seriously...effin' love this song, and I have been listening and dancing to it for like the past 35 minutes, it's so great. (>^_^)> Oh man, such good stuff...and yeah, just want to let people know I'm doing a lot better now. I made an estimate, and I'd say I'm 88.6% back-to-normal now - or just for Billy, I can say 88 and 5/6% better. ~_^ And yeah, you guys, seriously, thanks for being such awesome friends and whatnot. You've all made me feel so much better just by letting me spend time with you all, and it warms my heart so very much. So thank you. ::hellsa group hug:: And duuuuude, if people aren't too tired after Berkeley, then we seriously have to par-tay tonight, 'cuz me and Barry White need to get out and boogie. ~_^

 oh man

 Basking in glory of supreme hearing... *sits relaxed and smokes a blunt*

 Ha! Fuck you guys! Billy is near god power and hearing. So, you ass holes all that the line was "her soul is mine?" Well, fuck you! Regan MacNeil: Keep away! The sow is mine ! LOL! I win! No, you dont' believe me? check the following website: http://www.imdb.com/Quotes?0070047 Once you are there, scroll down and you will find it. I am so joyfully idignant right now! :)

 aww man we missed our Beth-window... Sorry, Blogger wasn't working when I got home last night. I'm going to try to call.

 hello from seattle, i'll be home on sunday, so hopefully another one of our hotels has internet access i also have my cell, so you guys can text message me if need be have fun whatever you guys do this week and happy belated birthday to val!

 hey again. if you guys are coming up on thursday i need details as soon as possible. i know that this will be a struggle because we have issues organizing any event in advance, but my aunt kind of wants to know what is going on so that i can actually see you guys when you come up and whatnot. call my cell and leave a message if it isn't on, write me an e-mail, call my home number and talk to my mom. just contact me in some way so that i know what is going on. gracias. i hope you are all having a lovely time. oh and by the way. i absolutely love love love johnny depp.

 hey guys- i'm at my aunt's house and i'm slightly bored. i hope you guys can come visit me on thursday. my aunt says that she'll cook dinner and you guys can even spend the night if you want to, so whatever you want to do is cool with me. when you figure it out, let me know so that i can get you directions and whatnot. i hope you are all having a lovely time without me. i miss you all greatly. oh- is the play on saturday still going down? if it is i hella want to go because i am in dire need of a play for AP english. um...i'll have my cell phone on tonight after about 9 because we're going to go see Pirates of the Carribbean at 7, so give me a call if you want. I miss you all terribly and i'm looking forward to seeing you soon.

 I have returned...with my purple shorts and all...mu-hu-ha-ha...lets use some mores elipsies...shall we?...welll...seeing as this conversation is going nowhere...

 have fun guys! i am going to call as soon as i am free.... party on dudes...

 okay, so quick reminder, tomorrow - Plaza @ 1:15 for Johnny English and Legally Blond 2, then crazy-go-nuts afterward.

 freaking a, we still have to see shakespeare too! hot damn and a bottle of catsup.

 really really, fuck me up the 'nads... i want to see yooooou val, and i already sent my condolences to you, but there is still nothing better than a big old-fashioned hug that i want to give you. :) remember that i love you, and there are a good 10 or so people on this blog that do too... anyway, believe it or not, i have work tomorrow from 5-9. i have to stay home from 12-4 to wait for the damn cable people too. ahh, fuck me... but i am pretty sure i can join you guys later though, it's no biggie since i have already seen s.w.a.t., legally blonde 2 and the matrix: reloaded. keep in mind that mandy, jessie and beth are not around too.... which gives us more reason to have another party for you next week! everyone pick a good time for monitor smashing. that shit and three mice are going down! ugh.

 Neal and I aren't together anymore. ..He basically has the same feelings that I had when I was with John - he feels like he's drifting away from me, and that he couldn't offer me as much as I offered him, etc. I understood it all completely, since I had gone through the exact same things as he is right now, and so we just talked our feelings out and everything. We're definately still going to be friends - we both still want to hang out with each other, and we don't want this to end ugly. It's really great that we've both come to an understanding and whatnot. I hurt a lot, obviously, because I honestly love Neal very much, and had planned on spending the rest of my life with him - I had never felt this comfortable with someone before, and it all seemed so perfect. But I guess it was a little too perfect, and karma had to come around and get me. But like I've been telling other people - sometimes you have to take life up the ass. So I'm gonna take life up the ass and like it. Neal had asked if I still wanted to continue it out for the rest of the year, and just not continue a relationship afterwards, but I said that I wouldn't be able to do that, and so he said that that was fine. And yeah...forgive me if I break out crying sometimes tomorrow, but I'll try not to. Honestly, I'm very glad that Neal got everything out into the open. And now I just need to move on. I'm just glad it all worked out so well, and I appreciate the time that I got to spend with Neal, even though it was short. And yeah..I don't know what else to say. Go to my livejournal if you want to see the whole IM conversation: http://www.livejournal.com/users/waste_my_days take care, everyone.

 ok, i'm trying to ditch her hours, i'm waiting for several calls back...if that doesn't work, i'll just pull some strings and force people in

 well...we can do 1 of 2 things then... 1) carlie can join up with us after she gets off work, or 2), we can see a late movie and then have pizza for dinner instead. if we do option #2, we could still hang out before going to the movie and whatnot, so yeah. and what movie would people want to see?? i'll try and get this planned out more..

 fine with me, except carlie works 12-4 tomorrow

 I'm actually gonna have my "party" ((even though I don't want to call it a party, but whatever)) on Tuesday...this is what I was thinking - *seeing a movie at the Plaza since Tuesdays are matinees ((I think it's called Two-Dollar Tuesdays or something like that)) *having lunch right after at Luigi's Pizza ((my mom said she would pay for everyone's food and drinks, so yeah)) *scavenger hunt ((like how we did at Jessica's party, 'cuz that was fun crazy-go-nuts)) And then just do whatever after that. Neal is gonna be there too, and yeeaaahh. The movies that are showing at the Plaza right now are S.W.A.T., Spy Kids 3D, Johnny English, Legally Blond 2, Terminator 3, and The Matrix Reloaded. Johnny English + Legally Blond 2 are a double feature, and so is Terminator 3 + The Matrix Reloaded; so if we wanted we could see 2 movies for the price of 1. The only thing is that S.W.A.T. doesn't have a matinee price, so if we wanted to see that, then we'd have to pay full price, and yeah. I thought matinee might be coolness since everyone would only have to pay $4 at most, and yeah - if that doesn't sound alright to people, then I can change it and think of something else to do. And yeah...I mainly just want to see y'all again, I've missed everyone so much, honestly. Anyways, take care.

 Val! I am totally for getting together for your birtthday, but I already bought you a present so you will just have to deal!!! OH WELL! haha. anyway, umm, I don't know if you know this but, unforunate as it is, a bunch of people are out of town this week: Jessie is in Florida, Beth is in Berkeley, Mandy is in Portland (dont know when she is returning), Carlie is somewhere, Ummmm i cant remember who else... I think that is it... Sorry it is late and I am sleepy...

 hey guys. i know i just got back, but i'm off again. i have to go to my aunt's house for the week. I don't really want to go, but I said I would, and I'll feel bad if I pull out now. I'll probably be online every now and then and you can call my cell if you want. I'm really bummed that I have to go because I've barely gotten to spend time with you guys, but we can do hella stuff when I get back.

 hey...back from UOP camp. and yeah...uhm...can people hang out on Monday?? I really don't know what I want to do for my belated birthday party, but I honestly just want to see everyone again. and as the corny saying goes, your presence but no presents. and yeah..if Monday doesn't work out, then maybe Tuesday, and then if Tuesday doesn't work out, then Wednesday, and if Wednesday doesn't work out, then just forget it and I'm fucked. so yeah. hope you're all doing well.

 Hmm, Freddy was always a strange one, what with that striped sweater and all... I'm going to say though, that due to the nature of such a corny film... they will alliance against a greater evil, and once that is killed off, fight each other but of course, it will be a standstill, and each will wander the world aimlessly never knowing a great opponent. Ok how about not? What do you guys want to do this evening? I feel like eating cheese on bread. Not that that is an activity, but I think I will go do that now...

 Woohoo, the Goonies was awesome. There were so many people there and it was hella cool, although I must admit I was having a great deal of trouble staying awake. Everybody that didn't go missed out. By the way...weird shit went down while I was gone. Strange things are afoot at the circle k.

 I love beth 4 eva also. Btw, I'm going with jessie to see Freddie versus Jason. I have seen their originals and I'm also curious as to who will win. Any bets? I'm thinking they both die because that would be just so climactic, right?

 jessie! godspeed, i shall miss you much! have fun in florida with hot florida boys, hee hee... =D BETH!!!! i remember kids, hooters hoot hoo hoo hoochies!

 hmm, jason's mom can fix that beth. haha.... anyhow, off i go, but that's beside the point: next friday (yes, one week fromt onight) i want to go see freddy vs jason. i know, i know, it's going to be horrible but i want to see it so badly... i mean, it's the most genious clash of pop culture sequals to ever walk the planet.... i'm only going to see it opening night though...it's better that way cause there'll be a ton of people in good spirits screaming like little girls...good itmes... ooh! tell jessica there'll be boys! that's get her there....haha, anyhow, that's the plan. now go forth and wreak havoc... seeya guys. much love.

 i'm lonely

 hey guys. i'm back from dc. does anyone want to go see the goonies with me tomorrow night at midnight at camera 7? give me a call

 Hey guys- I just wanted to remind those of you that are going to the concert with me that I need the $41. There's no hurry, but I just wanted to give you all a heads up just as a reminder. Muchas Gracias.

 Okay, so for AP Gov, I'm thinking meeting at Orchard Valley Coffee Shop for 7 so that we can at least get in 3 hours of studying and whatnot. I figure 7 is a somewhat decent time since it's after dinner and allows peeps to get other work done, but yeah. Sending this out in e-mail as well. Take care

 www.tacobell.com check this out to see who's leading in the "Who says you can't buy votes?" section! crunchy beef taco= arnold soft chicken taco= davis chalupa= bustamonte grilled stuft burrito= any of the other 133 candidates!

 Val, don't worry about the ticket. Mandy, if you want to take it, it's totally free. No worries.

 if it's still available, i'd like to go to the concert

 oh crap...beth, i didn't want a ticket...yo no tengo el dinero pagar para el boleto. Lo siento...can anyone else take it??

Laura 5. Valerie (i think, i'm not positive) 6. Me The tickets were $41, so pay me back as soon as you can so my dad doesn't go ballistic. Muchas gracias. And if anyone wants to use that extra ticket, holla at me.

 there's going to be a show called "the Mullets" on tonight on UPN at 9:30, sounds kinda fun, i dunno check it out...

 i was considering killing one of the freshmen today at practice...so annoying

 erg, it started raining while i was playing today, you know that "moist" (not really wet) type of rain, but as soon as i stopped playing, so did the rain. erg

 Wally said he "might be sick" on Monday... for... a while.

 no, they changed blogger and i dont like it any more, thoes bitches! teachers must be going on strike soon, I hella have already done my homework for the next two days, this is insane!

 ANDY RODDICK WON THE US OPEN! WHOO HOO! I

 oh, before i forget i'm now recieving mail at mandychronert@sbcglobal.net , and i'll probably check that one more, so yeah, that's all. beth- that concert sounds awesome

 flaming lips and the chili peppers? you don't even have to ask, i am so there, but i don't think i will be able to stand in line to get tix that day, so can i give my dollas to someone so they can get a ticket for me? that would be most rad. radness, whoop whoop!

 hey guys- chili peppers tickets go on sale on saturday the 13th at 10. the show is october 17th- it's a friday night and it's at the oakland coliseum. I'm going to go wait in line for tickets on the morning of the 13th. let me know if you want to go and we can all go get tickets together. I really want to go to this concert, and i think it would be awesome if you guys came with me, so let me know what's up by saturday. thanks.

 so, how was the show?

 sorry Mandy, here you go Val: 1. Anything by War, it is a great band.

 totally got my butt kicked by valley christian, (2-6, 3-6), and i wasn't just me the whole team got our butts collectively kicked (0-7), erg. oh well, what did i expect, hmm not much.

 meh, we lost 3-0 to Leland. -_- blaaaaaah... Hey, I'm compiling a Kazaa playlist of funky 70s disco songs and whatnot, and I need ideas on what to download!!! So yeah, give me suggestions on what to download. Here's what I have so far... *Barry White - You're the first, my last, my everything *Kool and the Gang - Jungle Boogie *The Commodores - Brick House *Wild Cherry - Play that Funky Music *The O'Jays - Love Train *Kool and the Gang - Ladies Night *Carl Carlton - She's a Bad Mama Jama *Gloria Gaynor - I Will Survive *Chaka Khan - I'm Every Woman *Al Green - Let's Stay Together *Weather Girls - It's Raining Men *Bee Gees - Disco Inferno *Karl Douglas - Kung Fu Fighting And yeah, so I totally need more and cooler songs!!! Help me out, pleeeaassseee

 so much homework...and i'm sticky from sweating at practice...and adam came by to visit with us

 OMFGZ! I CAN'T (FOR THE LIFE OF ME) FIND MY CHAPSTICK! you. will. never. understand. unless you are Beth, then you totally know... hahaha

 is it worth it, let me work it, put my thang down, flip it and reverse it.... =D

 Hey....I wanna do something....homework's all done, I showered for everyone, I'm dressed....I feel ready to go out and play.....or whatever....anything....does someone want to do something??

 Hey guys- tomorrow if you want a senior parking spot you need to bring ten dollars with you at 7:00- just thought i'd let you know if you didn't already.

 OOoooo, okay, for the people who watch Strong Bad e-mails - go watch "Comic" and at the end, click on "What's-her-name's" tombstone...you'll get a surprise, teheheeee....

 A celebrated All Hallows Eve to you and your kin.

 lauras, mandy, and all others without a 6 period...YOU MISSED IT! we had a real code red drill. RIght after the end of school bell rang they were like "this is a real code red drill! everyone back inside their classrooms!" so we sat on the floor in Tandon's room for like OVER AN HOUR. It turned out some guy who stole a car ditched it by branham with a bag that had a sawed off shotgun and the police were persuing him around branham and they ended up capturing him in the branham parking lot. Boy, a day with two code red drill, nothing can beat that but the pain in my bum from sitting on the hard floor for over an hour. sigh. what is this world coming to?

 i have the car wash on saturday, but i might skip it because i've been neglecting bowling lately and that's only like from 9:15-11:30 (i think) but i also have the sjsu onsite admission day 9i'm not sure what time though), but besides those things i'm available

 SO when are you gonna have your birthday laura? sunday after like 11:30 works best for me but if it doesn't work best for others, that's fine too.

 YaaaaY...! Thanks for the feedback Miss Niles. By the way, yes I cut my pants, and yes they look retarded but fuckit, who won't?

 hey laura, i'll totally be there for your birthday shindig and everything. and i'll see if i can chip in some dinero for gas and all. val's flair is gonna be her suspenders!!! oh yeah, sexy.

 so you guys, for twin day, or as i like to call it, nonatuplet day, here is what we are doing i think... *baseball shirts *jeans (cut or uncut) *converse *degrassi bead bracelets that mandy/kasso made *handkerchiefs? laura and i decided that everyone needed at least 3 items of flair... *hair in pigtails, if possible. i dunno. do something crazy. or something that is stho kyoot. out like manicotti yo.

 reminder: csf car wash is on that same day and i don't know about the rest of you, but i should probably work for at least a couple of hours, maybe just 8-10. other than that, those are the only restrictions for me, personally. i agree with those ideas laura - more than most, chinatown/fisherman's wharf/pier 39/market st./downtown sf/union square are all good because they are all in the general area... haight and castro are more of stretches to get to, but worth it as well... who knows... we should give a bit fat lovely san jose word up to our favorite "waitress" giselle, eh?

 Ok-- so... I know I have talked to *some* people about this, but discussion has been limited due to my not wanting to bring it up in front of people I was not considering inviting. (i.e. in the mornings, Anne hangs out near us and I thought it rude to bring it up in front of her...) Anyway, my birthday is Next tuesday, and, rather than having a real party, I was thinking we could use it as an excuse for an excursion to San Francisco, since we've all talked about going/have gone numerous times. So here is what I was thinking, and, of course, I need feedback, because I want to know if you have obligations to fulfill, etc.: I was thinking the Saturday one week from the Homecoming dance, November 8. As far as times go, I know many people can't/don't want to stay out there the *whole* day, so we could leave early-ish in the morning, sometime between 10-12, and leave at 5 or so. Again, these matters obvioulsy require feedback, so if you could contribute... please do. As far as drivers go... well, that is one of those things we must talk about, heh. I mean, I'm not asking anyone to drive necessarily, but I mean... if you REALLY want my parents to chaperone us around in cars... haha. If anyone is willing to drive though, that would be a great help, and we could organize the number of people into the least amount of vehicles. (I'm sure my parents wouldn't mind us taking the van [seats 7] for optimum use) Umm, what else... Oh! Basically, the places people have talked about going in sf include shopping on Haite, Chinatown, and that area with Urban outfitters, FAO shwartz, the Virgin Megastore, etc. etc. Although actually... we should hit up Amoeba, hehe. Those are just some ideas, so tell me what you're really interested in and whatnot, alright? Allllright. P.S. Afterwards... my mom and dad have a need to do that whole parental thing with food and whatnot. So we'd probably just... eat here or out, but probably not out since we'll have spent our earnings by then, haha. Well and cake. My mom is obsessed with buying me this one cake for my brithday, so ... you all have to eat it!! haha. OK SO give me FEEDBACK, hoes!!

 ah, you will laugh, you will cry, you'll shit a brick when you see long as a gay man...haha, gooood times. i am slowly returning to my normal self...i feel liek bringing my guitar to school tomorrow. i don't have the guts to play it actually in front of people, but maybe i will bring it in case...haha, ok, enough late night meanderings for me...

 EVERYONE, GO SEE THE PLAYS THIS WEEKEND!!!! RYAN WAS SO AMAZING THAT HE ACTUALLY MADE PEOPLE CRY!!!! JESSIE DID A GREAT JOB!!!!! AND COME SEE MY UBERLY CUTE PLAY!!!!! MY LITTLE FRESHMAN ANDY IS SO EFFIN' ADORABLE, YOU HAVE TO SEE HIM AND EVERYONE ELSE, THEY'RE GREAT!!!!! SUCH HAPPINESS!!!! ^_^

 oh yeah... and jessie... i memorized one monologe today in the shower. i got pretty into it... enough that my hands literally went NUMB every time I went trhough an emotional part. i'm gonna make smith proud of my skills. in a manly way. or wait... noooooo

 I feel horrible that I made you feel like a child- apart from hating you for making me feel like shit (I guess we made eachother feel the same way)- I don't think I ever degraded you. I tried hard to never insult you and even gave you compliments. It's not lost on me that I can come across and rude and obstinent. Since RYLA, I've been trying to remove the negative side of my confidence. My confidence is my best and worst trait: it's the only reason why I accepted myself, that I am still alive today, and can push myself to do well in so many areas, but it can also be my worst because I will mow through anything that gets in my way. You know how Tchernio has roadblocks? I don't- cause I use TNT and blow them up as soon as I can. (bad humor and analogies are my second and third worst traits) My confidence comes from one of the toughest things I've ever done in my life. I don't talk about it much cause it still hurts and I feel talking won't help. My family hates gays. Even now, my father talks shit about them, silently and behind my back. My mom thinks I need to go see a shrink. Why, am I a ward-ready freak? I snap at her and tell her that's who I am. How could she not figure it out? She always used to smile and say that I was "her rainbow child." She saw a rainbow out the window of the hospital the day I was born. That explain two things- that I was born gay and that even God and I share a bad sense of humor. Back to crying... everyone that I looked up to when I was young treated faggots like spoiled, diseased children. Finding the will within me to resist that perception made me feel invincible. The only reason why I do well in school and stuff is because I have an incredible push inside of me to prove myself more than shit. To prove myself better than the people I grew up with. To prove them wrong. That's also why, no matter how nice my parents may ever be to me, I will always hate them. My hate of them is my personality, it is myself. I could never say that to their faces cause it would crush them, so the nicest thing I can do to them is fight. I value my friends greatly. Sure, sometimes I may be a pompous ass cause I'm frustrated- but you must know that I would do anything for you if anything ever needed to be done. Thats why when one of them treats me like shit, it hurts bad and drives me insane. The one thing that embarasses me is when someone who is my friend treats me like shit. It makes people wonder what a crappy person I am. I'd really appreciate it, even though it may be your nature, to make an extra effort to be curteous to me. If we have differences, talk them out, I'll see the reason... growing up with Jason taught me to be waaaay to logical. :) No offense to you, buddy ol' pal. Actually come to think of it, I may not have... I mean... the sprinklers... go figure. So yea, when I called you a bitch I meant it, and I still do mean it if I keep getting treated like shit. But I seriously don't want to keep meaning it. Let's call a truce and start an experiment... in politeness.

 Ok. Well, since, like you said, I won't be seeing you, I am going to go ahead and say a few things, although you might not read this? Hmm... I understand your point of view, but I think there are A LOT of misunderstandings between us. The concert seat thing may have been what set you off, but after reading that, it is clear that there were issues prior. So about the seats. I wasn't trying to be malicious, but yes, it pissed me off that you said we could have our seats back when they started playing. And they did, and you ignored us when we tapped you on the shoulder to ask you to move back. Maggie and I are each about a foot shorter than you; we couldn't see from where we were standing, but you probably didn't know that. And, actually, I was okay with you talking to Kasso and such during the break, i understood you drove us and I was grateful to you, but at that moment I wanted to be selfish, yes. And I *do* apologize for that. The seating arrangement wasn't exactly the best thing for anybody; some people don't care, some people did. But the point is, I wasn't doing it to be a bitch to you on purpose. As far as speaking to you condicendingly, yes, I do that because I feel that is how you treat me, so in retaliation, I too do the same. of course, reading what you wrote, you do it because you think I do it first. So of course that is a misunderstanding. That's the way it has always been. I have, for the past lot of time, felt like you ignored me, treated me like a child, and generally a jerk. So what did I do? Treated you with an edge. I admit my personality is not on the nice side to, well, anyone. My acting bitchy has never been a good thing, sure, but that's the way I am in the same way you tend to be obstinant and rude. I'm not trying to be like "i'm right and you are wrong" but looking at the big picture, I think we both have the same problems. We're both rude by nature, we both assume the other is purposely being an asshole just to us, and we both retaliate back. Oh, and we both fail to realize that we come off that way from the start and then wonder why all of a sudden the other is making snide comments. I mean, for a recent example, I totally didn't mean it in a rude way when I asked if you had directions. I simply wanted to know if it had been found how to get ther and if we should get directions or not. It wasn't meant like "YOU should get directions." Not to mention the fact that I was unaware about the tough day you had had and the tire ordeal and whatnot, just like you were unaware that I couldn't see from the place I was standing. I don't think I am always a bitch to you, and if you feel that way, then I am sorry. Last week when we went to find bubble wrap was just fine, was it not? Of course specific incidents are bitchy, but that is with *everyone*. It's okay if you think I am a bitch, you are entitled to that, just as I em entitled to what I think of you, right? I just hope you understand that I was never out to get you intentionally or anything like that. Alright well, this probably didn't ocme out the way I meant for it to either, cause everything else sounds like I am all mad, but it's not that way necessarily.

 i'm gonna say this online simply because i probably won't have time next week to say it in person and i don't particularly care to waste my time on the subject. i wanted to have a great night friday- friday and saturday were my only escapes from work until, literally, at least next monday. in fact, i did for the most part. but then laura decided to get pissy again. this is probably gonna offend some people, and i'm sorry- but this is how i feel i've been treated and what happened on friday. i don't want to drag everyone into it, which is why i didn't say anything friday or saturday cause i wanted people to be able to enjoy themselves... for a while now laura, you haven't been nice to me at all. i put up with it cause i didn't care for drama. but i seriously can't remember the last time you ever did something nice or said something nice to me... its been a long time. everything that you say is an insult or a joke on me. i don't know what i've done to deserve that. i don't deserve that. tell me if i did something wrong- but i'm pretty fucking sure i didn't. anyway, everyone has a breaking point. you set the tone friday when i got to kasso's. i had just had to remove a spare tire from teh van and bring a 100 pound bench up from the garage to the van alone... so i was kinda tired and just wanted to relax watching tv. so i wasn't really in the mood to deal with your general bitchiness to me. people talked about getting directions to the arena and kasso went off to go get the computer working, or so i figured. after that you said, "Well Ryan, are you gonna go get directions or what?" It sounded really bitchy and pissed me off. it was the continuing thing of you treating me like shit, ordering me about as if you were above me then, at the concert, you were incredibly rude to me. during a break i was finally getting to talk to kasso- basically the only person i could talk to during the entire thing- and you decide that you're more important and want to kick me out of my seat. you could at least be polite and recognize that i'm stuck at the end and it would be cool to let me enjoy myself- after all i fuckin drove you. but no, you come back from the bathroom and get all bitchy over it. then you have to grab me and tell me to move. i say no and then you say condesendingly, "no you don't understand" and throw me to the side. why did you talk to me like a six year old? you made me look like an idiot in front of a bunch of people. that was way out of line. when i called you a bitch there, i meant it. i havne' t sincerely called anyone a bitch in a long long time. you deserved it. stop treating me like i'm nothing, like i'm an underclassa nd don't deserve anything. a friend would not have been such a bitch about the seating and at least thought about someone else's well being. maybe i paid the same price as you for the concert nad wanted to enjoy it to? would sitting one seat over ruin it for you? probably not. you could still talk to maggie and shout over to kasso or had me say something. shoving me off to the end of the row again was really inconsiderate. it's extremely mean to do something like that to someone who wouldn't dream of hurting you- in a sly comment, insult, or joke. all of those times you've said something rude/mean to me, i've kept my mouth shut. i never insult something you do or say. i treat you like a friend- i always say good things about you to other people. you certainly don't treat me like a friend. don't expect to be treated like one anymore- i've had it. so yea- thats my diatribe online here... that laura's a fuckin bitch. i wanted to keep silent about it, especially on friday cause i didn't want to upset anyone elses night, but that won't solve anything. hope you guys understand that i don't like being treated like shit...

 You know how my space has been taken all of the time this year on B-days? Not anymore! Jones tried to have the district put a parking policy/warning sign up, but she never suceeded. I, however, wrote an email to the head of construction at the district, making sure that I hinted at my *powerful* position on the advisory board. Eight working days after I emailed him, he came up to me and said that he had sent me an email of what the sign could say... but I never responded (I never checked oops!) so he went ahead and ordered a sign that he liked. Wham. My ass got Branham a sign. Obviously, I'm a more respected mover and shaker than Jones. So... if ya need anything done... just pay me off :) lol that was fun

 Laura, that's effin' awesome. I just looked through all of them and had totally forgot about some of that stuff. The chocolate pic with Ryan and Susan is great, hehehe. ^_^

 hitting up the new starbucks on camden to do hw. feel free to join.

 Yea, I *think* but I am not sure they are doing firworks tomorrow night in celebration of Santa Cruz's birth. We should all dress in diapers and run around screaming "HAPPY BIRTHDAY SANTA CRUZ" ... Ok, I think only *I* did that as an 8-year old...

 alright my b-day... around 2 we can take off from my place with the cakes and stuff to santa cruz. i'm driving my mom's car, which holds four ppl plus me. i think jessie said her car's heading over the hill too (hopefully it'll head back over unlike some other Fords I know of). jason said its a go for his car to go as well. i'd like to stay until dark (are those fire ppl still doing their thing?), but i guess some ppl want to go to the night game. you guys can leave early but my car is gonna stay in santa cruz, so work out some rides. other than that.... make sure you have a spare set of clothes cause i hear chocolate stains! :)

 as a cool resurrection thing, i would change the layout but: a.) i forgot a lot of html. b.) i don't think anyone looks at this page as an actual page anyway, just in the edit post format, or at least, i do. grad night activities i would prefer (1 being most, 7 being least) _7__ casino games _2__ karaoke _3__ fortune telling _5__ one other activity i forgot _6__ yet another _4__ i think i have memory issues _1__ other (please specify) _____ sex! _________ mu hu ha ha. i am so bored.

 Wow, it's been revived! Makes me think of that chuch marquee over by Price "Revival Oct. 5-8 with reverend Jim and Pat B..." God was trying to tell us something guys and I guess this was it! THE BLOG HAS BEEN REVIVED!! praise the lord!!!

 i agree with beth, total loss of substance on this damn blog, eeee... but it is 1/10 my fault, or however many people are on here. anywho, just wanted to mention that the aforementioned are two different shows. what laura meant to say was: saturday: jason webley. punk rock accordian pirate. who jessie wants to have sex in the woods with. he's that good. AND the phenomenauts. crazy space rock with men dressed in crazy duds who shoot silly string and throw toilet paper at the audience when they play. hella hella good times. there is no way you could not like this show. skankin' good time. sunday: suburban legends. basically what laura said, seven crazy kids doing crazy flips and dances everywhere while still playing their instruments! wuh-oh. plus, the asian one is hecka cool too. yee-ah. AND moonlife. ok well, moonlife isn't a necessarily good thing, but you go for the humor of it. bad dance music with cheesy lyrics and people dressed in tight silver shiny outfits. and they shake their tushies. .....yes, laura and i and the gang spend a lot of time at these functions, seriously. hella bomb.

 Well now, I can say something to make you all feel better about yourselves... You know that freshman I TOTALLY sexed up last night? yea, him... Well he talks to this chick that sits at the freshman table at art so I am going to try to get in with her so that I can walk with her maybe sometime in the future and he will walk with her too so THEN MAYBE I will be in closer proximity to him than the previous 5 feet or more. Well of course I am not all too serious about this, but it is way more entertaining than listening to Jessica eat my ear off about why she doesn't like Anne or Anne eat my ear off about condiments and dinner utensils. Oh and to anyone who is interested: There is a show this Saturday that I believe many of you would fine quite interesting. Jason Webley, the cool Accordian player from Seattle is coming, and he gives a very crowd involved show where you get to dance, bang empty bottles,sing along, and spin in circles! Also, the Suburban Legends are playing, and for those of you who have not seen this band, you should, because they are energetic ska, with like 7 people, who do choreographed dance moves, flip over eachother, and random acrobats on stage. MIGHTY ENTERTAINING!! For those of you who (especially) are avoiding an emo-kid show, this is definately not one of those, so let the good times roll. =) Oh, and P.S. That wasn't meant to come off as all-knowing or anything, since I am well aware certain of you are already going and all, but I felt that the general term "show" may imply something less extraordinary and did not do specifically these 2 bands justice. END

 haha, the monster comment cracked me up beth... the activity of choice in the ridges was "prostitutes"...good times... good day for me too... i've been actually been having some decent times lately, which is new, heh... oh, cept for this. guess who this is: "I'm dating a 20 year old because i'm obviously too good for anyone my own age who would fucking rock my world, but whatever" (btw, this is not a direct quote...it was implied however, heh) so don't really guess. just hold it in your mind, accepting the fact that im going to crawl in a hole and become a nun... or somthing...haha

 i've come to the conclusion that this blog has died because the majority of people have online journals. I think that kind of eliminates the need for this blog. But I don't want this blog to die either, so I think we should share the wealth. I'll start. Today was a decent day. We had to march in band, whcih always sucks major ass. English was a waste of time. We talked about teachers we hated for about 30 minutes and then we spent the rest of our time working on some ghetto ass essay. And then Ed Adams (who I swear is insane) starting drawing all over my paper and poking me with his pencil. One of these days I'm just going to open a can of whoop ass on him and I'm sure Alice will have my back. He would probably kill both of us though, because he's a freaking monster. Government was boring. Brad picked on Josh as usual and Josh stood on his soap box and preached tolerance and understanding. Those two always keep the class interesting. Maggie, Val, and I have decided to change the grad night survey and to have sex as our number one choice of activity for the cruise. Karaoke was a close second. DOWNTOWN!

 so true... let's spice it up... OK I HAD SEX WITH THAT FRESHMAN BOY... Yes, that's right... last night, we did it... in the middle of the quad. He was really good, though. kthnxbye.

 this blog has died, no one posts anything anymore on it. i guess its since we all see each toher at school and s. whatev.

 it's all about parting the c yo.

 finito con apps de UC! what ever, i'm done! yay! what comes before part b? PART- AY!!!!!

 I'm trying to submit the UC one, but the site is still down...grrrr, i guess i'm going to calpoly

 WOOT WOOT BITCHES!!! I'm hellsa done and hellsa glad! no more apps!

 yeah, if we wanted to do one, i think it might be past the deadline, but they'll really keep accepting them for awhile because their deadline isn't even until like next year or something so as long as we get it in in like the next two weeks, i think it will be cool. sigh - only 200 words left to write for my uc apps

 WANTED : nice home for my lovable 13" tv/vcr (although i think the vcr part eats tapes, but if there is someone out there who can fix it....) black w/ matching remote. besides the vcr part, it's a great little tv. i'm willing to negotiate a price for this bad boy. ...tambien: what's the deal with our group yearbook pda? is there even going to be one? keep me posted!

 um..my sister has the cd. hehe, the switchfoot conspiracy.

 okay, if anyone has downloaded "meant to live" by switchfoot, can you sent it to me, PLEASE?? i keep downloading it on Kazaa, but it's being a bitch and every version i try breaks up, so it sucks...does anyone have it?

 hmm

 besides teh car crash...

 what happened to Jairo?

 poor jairo :(

 muhu! i got a new pair of shoes that wasn't even suspose to be for me! see, my little sister wanted these low top converse that are grey and are suede so we ordered them online for her. she told me she needed a size seven but didn't specifiy womens or mens size. i was like, i guess that seems resonable that she;d wear my size (cause i wear a 7 in converse) because i can fit into some of her shoes, even though they are a wee bit small (i was figuring she was just getting them to grow into or soemthing) so basically they came and they are way to big for her but are my size. and she couldn't find anything else on the converse web site that fit her fancy and it would cost like a lot to ship them back and i haven't got new shoes in a while so yeah, i'll be wearing these new zapatos on the morrow and you can ooh and awe at them. muhu, biotch!

 i have homosexual tendencies. i've just come to realize it. love, jason.

 does anyone want to meet up and do the Gov packet as a group??

 la de da de da! totally forgot it was a late start, i almost went to school at like 7:25 and my mom didn't even try to stop me, hmm

 Saturday = mmmkay And hey, can we have Study Group for A.P. Gov Monday night??

 ok all!

 That is my Sister's Bat Mitzvah, sorry, can't join you Laura.

 OK so... birthday San Fran thing... is SATURDAY, ok all??

 cookies! =D

 what type of stuff should i bring for the potluck?

 honestly, i have no preference at this point. i'll go wherever everyone else wants to go, so just fill me in.

 i have no preference but it would be nice to hang out with jessica since we haven't as a group in a while...

 ohhh, okay, thanks Beth. If the choice comes between Jessie's house and Jessica's house, then my vote goes towards Jessie's house. There's enough space for everyone there, and most importantly, no Maurice, hehe.

 are we doing jessie's house for new year's for sure? cause she is away and i am gonna call her and let her know the final details. personally, i wouldn't want to do it at either jessica's or jessie's, but jessie's casa is sufficient. any other suggestions anyone? we need a final consensus soon so jessie can alert her parentals.

 so jessie's house for new year's and winter ball?

 val- i think the plan was that we were going to jessie's house before/after the dance because her parents are going to be in LA. So yeah, i think that is what we had planned. And i'm guessing that we will be leaving early and just going and hanging out at jessie's.

 guys - this is my farewell before I take off to Santa Barbra, the possible home of my future college. I'll fill you in on all the stuff when I get back but otherwards, i'll be bakc tuesday night

 Hey, everyone, I know this is really early to ask, but... What are we doing after Winter Ball?? Or if we're leaving early from it ((which I think we probably are)), where would we go?? I'm asking because I have to give Saiyin the specifics about everything so he can tell his parents...otherwise they're going to pick him up immediately from the dance once it's over, and I kinda don't really want that to happen...they're really protective/anal-retentive about things, and so they need details about where he'll be...I'm really sorry, but would we be able to come up with an idea?

 Billy, I think we're supposed to be going to Jessica's house, although I think some of us don't really want to go over there since her house is kinda cramped. Jessie's backyard is up as an option, and that's all I know.

 Um, what is gonna happen on New Year's Eve?

 hey guys, i'm going to la for disneyland and the beaches. i'm coming back on the 31st no later than 6 pm. so i'm gonna call in with some people everynow and then and ask what new years eve plans are, so i know where to go when i get home ok? it's kind aweird, but my house is free if you don't mind coming over at like, 7. or earlier. somthing...haha. much love, tap someone, and have fun!!! *good ridance 2003!!!*

 what about the degrassi marathon? anyone up for it?

 hey hey to all! just checking in to see what's up!? haven't seen/ heard from people in hellsa days, but i'm home and available, most likely, so just call or what ev. and happy/merry chrismukah! (from the o.c. whoop whoot)

 haha, that's great carlie...but i must say that the last sentence made me think "darling nikki"....eewww, putting your sister into that song does NOT work! hehe

 hehe - the funniest thing happened today to my little sister. My aunt, uncle, and cousin were here from Georgia so we went with them to Santa Cruz to go to this marine laboratory that's just past Natural Bridges. We were out on the cliff that over looks the ocean (its about 40 feet above the ocean) and my little sister is throwing and kicking rocks into the water below. She kicks a rock and her shoe flies off her foot, landing 40 feet below in the ocean. At first we could see the shoe but then a wave comes in and pushes the shoe even farther under the cliff and to add to that, its not possible to go down onto the beach. Her shoe that she got about a month ago is now lost to the ocean. Only her right foot too. So we drove into Santa Cruz and bought her another pair of shoes. It was hella funny. She considered trying to climb down the cliff to get it and then the wave came. So we bought her a pair of converse that are really cool. They are blue high tops with light blue stitching and are light blue on the inside. So she left for Santa Cruz with a pair of shoes and came back with three shoes. We hassled her the rest of the time about losing her shoe. Poor poor little nikki!

 Happy Chriswanzakuh... MEHE!! spread the cheer. =)

 awww carlie beat me to it... merry xmas eve everyone, as well as happy hanukah, happy kwanzaa, happy boxing day eve eve and whatnot... much love to all!

 Happy day before Christmas and happy Hanukkah to thoes of you not celebrating the day before christmas. ok, im done now

 who owns the truth, dare, or do you know cards? They left them at mi casa. I have them in my purse so just ask me next time you see me with my ball sac.

 Maggie: shut your ball-sac up, ok? Ball-sac, that's right.

 BALL SAC! that is all.

 saturday, sunday, friday, i'm free for all of them. woot! no scheduling conflicts for beth.

 uuhhh...Jessica, Jenny, and Susan aren't on Blogger. need to see their lists

 does everyone on the secret santa list have access to blogger to post wish-lists? i'm down with either saturday or sunday, whatever. i'm down with the pda also.

 Saturday hella works for me. Sunday works for me, although I have church from 4.30-6ish, but there is a bitty chance I could get out of it. I'm in for the PDA.

 saturday works for me, as long as it is after 1. sunday also works for me, as long as it is after 5. yep. and we really do need a good pda party! so everyone, start gathering pictures and phrases so we can all have a fat collage orgy. a full page is $250. so can maybe 10 or so people chip in and pay $25 each? or 22.72 for 11 people. 20.83 for 12 people. (just thought i'd mention it thomas singleton style. hahaha)

 Aaaah, wait, can we change the Holiday party again?? Apparently my mom switched Tamale Day to Sunday, so now I'm busy Sunday instead of Saturday. Is Saturday still an option???

 oh and, can we get the stuff together for the group pictures and also the PDA semi-soon? I know a few of us picked up info for The Picture People and the Sears photo place. I can't remember exactly, but I think Picture People is more expensive and you get 1 less pose, but you get your photos back a lot sooner or something. Anyway, if we could get this together soon, it'd be cool, cause I am asking my parents to pay for it for Christmas, heehee. Since I have had no money since the beginning of time. riiiight.

 hey guys, new date for our holiday extravaganza is looking like Sunday the 21st....speak now or forever hold your peace... i kinda forgot to make a x.mas list, so for what it's worth... ~things to decorate my room. if you've been i my room (which you have) you can probabaly get a gist that any thing originol works... ~ I like to...um...wear things? haha, anything that's cool...i've always wanted someone to have a shirt made for me that says ssomthing...i cna't think of what. maybe somthing about my car? rock and roll? i dunno...anything you can find is good...oh oh! i want a shirt that says thespians do it onstage...i can't believe urband outfitters soesn't have one...grrr, so i want to have one made ~ dark red is a good color ~ twelve drumming (hot and sexy) drummers...haha

 hey mandy, are you going to be home tomorrow or something? I left my bag in your car with all my binders and whatnot. I can pick it up if you'll be at your house, and yeah.

 cool w/ me.

 we're thinking the 20th of december (a saturday or more aptly the first saturday of break) for the par-tay. any conflicts?

 mandy's wish-list *dandy warhols cd *offspring cd, not americana (already own it) *movie/music posters *John Cusack movies -sure thing -better off dead -high fidelity -hot pursuit -eight men out -america's sweethearts -con air -etc. *Airborne *Big Trouble (i *Bulletproof Monk *world peace *sweaters, t-shirts *something that i will actually use *something creative, fun, useful, etc. whatever your (whoever you may be) little heart desires (maybe not "whatever", you know what i mean) PS i also got my first big envelope yesterday! whoo hoo chico! yeah, chronert legacy, but no thanks

 hey guys, my mom said "whatever the fuck you want, my carlie." on the secret santa gift exchange dinner a mi casa. We need to figure out a day soon. I can't do the 19th because its my dad's birthday and jason would like me to mention that he wont be here the 22-4 of december. i guess we can do it any time during the break and we wouldn't have to od it at night, we could do it for lunch or in the afternoon too. so whatev. Oh, and listen to this biotches! i already got an acceptance letter from a college. we won't mention that the college is chico, but hey! if all else fails, i can go north and hang out with Amber and Danny Johnson. For whoever got me here's a list of nots: -no thongs -no starbucks cards -no tower cards -no movie (blockbuster, hollywood, etc.) cards -no gift cards of any kinds -no baby baths like i got last year, i want something I can actually use or whatev if you get what i mean -no obscure dolls that i'm never gonna play with Here's a list of something that i just thought of that i want: -electrical tape in cool colors (not the scotch kind that comes in that 4 pack at like target because that stuff blows big balls) try looking at home depot or other various hardware stores, but the one by target only has it in black, if you even want to get it for me, thoes were just a few pointers, let me add a few more commas, and make this totally like, a, run, on, sentence -a cool hat or beanie that's not hella ugly -sanrio stuff -cool soccer gloves (they are different because they have this special material on the tips of the fingers so you can do throw ins and the ball doesn't slip out of your hands) -a new soccer bag, but i'll have trouble explaining to you how i want it so i'll just stop talking now -cute underwear (size med/6) that is actually functional, let me repeat again, NO THONGS! i already have enough of thoes now that i'm done typing, ill stop

 .my shit list. *The Dismemberment Plan - Emergency & I *Switchfoot - The Beautiful Letdown *duct tape. whatever color. I don't care. *bright colored electrical tape. or black. *funky shoes from goodwill or whatnot. i'm a size 8. whatevers. *chunky plastic jewelery *harry potter whatevers. *hats. *small black zip-up sweater. one that has pockets. *a cheap-ass gameboy game that i'd get amusement out of. which is basically anything. * starbucks card. *jamba juice card. meh, i think that's it.

 Laura's 2003 you-better-fucking-get-me-something-good (jk) Wishlist: 1) A scarf. Uhhh, all I can say is I Love Scarves. Warm winter ones, hair scarves, neck scarves, any scarves! 2) Cool pins/jewelery/belt/whatever. Handbags or socks or bracelets; just as long as it's cute, I'll dig it! Yea, I am super vague. 3)Just like everyone else, I too want the new Coheed and Cambria cd so I can sing along in a high pitch. CDs are going to be my demise. You all know I would love more of them... particularly...: The Dismemberment Plan-! or Ice of Boston Modest Mouse- the fruit that ate itself Pretty Girls Make Graves- New Romance 4)If you are unoriginal or completely at a loss: Gift Certificates for cd stores, Starbucks, or Urban Outfitters would do the trick. 5) Super cool aqua eyeshadow, yo! Sorry I wrote so much...!!

 ok...here's my wishlist, but if you (meaning my secret santa) can think of anything else, go right ahead. So, here it goes: -starbucks gift card (duh) -CDs: ->oasis- what's the story morning glory? ->AFI- sing the sorrow ->queen (any cd will do) ->Moulin Rouge soundtrack -no thongs please well, that's all i can think of for now- i'll post if i anything else pops into my mind. peace out.

 um ok. i'm not really wantin anything materialistic for under $15/20 at the moment i guess cause its all taken care of... some funny tshirts from injeanious would be awesome. (thats a store on the top of castro and market if ur brave enough... really funny stuff their. ur gauranteed to build a sixpack there). winged migration dvd is actually a good idea maggie. oh yea, and NO to any transgender paraphanelia. don't need any. i dunno- a good surprise would be nice cause i know what i'm getting from everyone else i know. so yea. :)

 additions to the maggie wish-list: ~starbucks card. ~tower/rasputin/streetlight gift certificates. ~NO MAS THONGS. ~pretty scarves. ~cool tote bag. ~if you think you are sneaky, you can get me any of these cds: > denali - the instinct > burning airlines - identikit > atmosphere - seven's travels > coheed and cambria - in keeping secrets of silent earth 3. or something like that. i might have this by then though, heh. 9.99 at rasputin, woot. > kill bill vol. 1 soundtrack > elbow - a cast of thousands. > botch - we are the romans. > ok, i need to stop with cds, this list could get very ugly. ~punch-drunk love dvd. ~bowling for columbine dvd. ~ winged migration dvd. ~ more gas. for the car, silly. the keys to my happiness are coffee, music, boys and love. get me any of those and you are a deity in my eyes.

 i made the names for our drawing, good luck to y'all peeps

 kasso's non sexual wish list ~starbucks gift card ~a really cool tshirt preferably small/medium or large kid size (atari (not the band, you see no "s" there) tshirt if you can find one my size!) ~makeup (only from sephora and since its expensive there i just want one good eyeliner color, but that is if your brave!!) ~tower/rasputin/streetlight gift card ~anything you think i might enjoy (not in bed) ~urban outfiters gift certificate ~kill bill dvd ~a really cute bag (louis vuiton jk!!) ~belts, belts and more belts!!!!, i can't keep using my brothers and well maggie has my other one ~lord of the rings poster! or dvd of the extended version of either 2 movies IMPORTANT MESSAGE: spending limit is $20 (all of us are broke during the holidays, we have large families!!)

 ooh, and another detail: who is organizing the actual drawing out of underwear? whomever chooses to do so, make all of the name on gift tags, using the computer or one handwriting, so that you won't be able to tell who gave it to you from the tag.... and by the way, PLEASE COME SEE MY GHETTO PLAY!!!! lol

 gah...hi, i'm jessie and i'm here to cause some logistical trouble.... first: darn you lotr!!! darn you souza!!! may you all burn in hell together. while you're all seeing glory on the big screen i've be singing ave maria and it'll be so...much...umm...cooler? heh. what eve.... second: ryan and i were going to a gsa dance on the last friday before break...is there any way we could do it another day? perrrty please? if not...um...i dunno, then not. haha. i, jessica renee horvath, hereby solomly swear on my own crappy guitar that i will never tell a soul, not johnny depp, not jason's mom, who i choose as a secret santa...if i break this solomn vow, let me burn in hell, never having the ability to be ice cold.... heh. mm, i'll work on the wishlist

 last post... ok so we need to get this secret santa thing kicked off asap. let me know if i am forgetting anything but here are some ground rules: you pick names from a hat, a bucket, jason's hole-y underwear, whatever, but whoever you pick, you get and you must get a semi-decent gift for that person. if you absolutely to the max cannot have that person for whatever reason, you can put the name back in the container/receptacle and draw another name, but you can only draw once! so whoever you get the second time, you are stuck with for good. exceptions: jason can't get carlie and vice versa. you guys are probably getting each other gifts anyway, so no fair. on the friday when break officially begins, we are gonna do the fatty gift exchange. some ideas still up for grabs: ~dinner at a fine dining establishment? (not in 'n out, weinerschnitzel, taco bell, taco bravo, the like...) ~carlie making dinner for us/potluck. we just need someone's house for this. ~scavenger hunt! with clues! everyone needs to put their gift in a box with the same still to be determined size, as well as the same still to be determined wrapping paper. the thing here is ambiguity! by agreeing to participate in the secret santa exchange, you are thus sworn to secrecy and cannot tell your secret santa to anyone. NO ONE. i repeat, NO ONE. if you do, you are a hoser and a loser and the rest of the degrassi clan shall shun you for life. hella no kidding. as far as the procedure for getting gifts, here are two options: ~you dyke. these have been your friends for hella years. you better know what the fuck to get these people. or ~to make it easier, and so people get things they actually want, people can make wish lists and post it here on blogger or pass them around, whichever they prefer. here, i'll start. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ maggie's hella bomb wish-list. ~love ~jason's mom ~the live 2003 coldplay dvd/cd set IN THE DVD BOX muthafuckas. soooooo.... yeah. we have like two weeks. let's get a move on it, uhhhhh.....

 oh and val, i have like, three of them, if i find them i will let you know.

 well it looks like you'll just have to be molested for a while. mwa haha. tipped. beaten. right back at ya.

 i bought 10 Lord of the Rings tickets for december 17th at 6:00 at the Century 22. I need 7.50 from: Mandy, Laura S, Maggie, Bryan, Ryan, Susan, Jessica, and Billy. Pay up ASAP! My parents will sexually harass me until all the money is given to me. If you don't pay you don't get a ticket!

 sorry, i don't know where mine is

 does anyone still have their permit test, and if they do, could i borrow it to study from???

 so this is like, hella late notice, but my bday and 5 days dinner is gonna be tomorrow, (sat) at the campbell buca di beppo's at 5 pm. yes, 5 pm... it was either that or 9 pm... anyway, i made reservations for 12 people, so just um, yeah, let me know so i can always say, OOPS we only had 11 seats in case patrick finds out... anyway, lovely weekend to ya'll.

 Hey all... Urban Outiftters Grand Opening in Santa Cruz on December 3rd. 1401 Pacific Ave. haha. Just got the e-mail, so I figure I woudl share.

 mandy you are too cute

 GRIND! EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!

 AP Gov students -- Study group Monday at Ryan's house, 4:30-whenever. Bring a few dollars so we can buy a pizza or something when we get hungry and whatnot. Yeahz.

 those suggestions sound yummy

 Yeam I think ethinc food is great; although I am more interested in thai food (FRIED BANANA) than anything also. In addition, there is this one restaurant I have never been to, but it sounds interesting... it's called Straits, and I think it is pretty expensive, but it's supposedly asian-thai-american fusion. hella crazy. But, I would give it a shot. They have a location in Santana Row, but I am not sure what the prices are. Hmm. Jan 24 works for me... although by that time I may have no money, heh, but we will see. Muahahah!

 word up home-people, i am on this blogger like a bitch. so i seriously like this whole "ethnic night" thing and dining out can be made fun again! two of my strongest suggestions are: 1. getting just cheesecake at the cheesecake factory one night. 2. crepes! french pride... crepe danielle in saratoga is really good. here is more info if ya'll are interested: urlLink http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/entertainment/columnists/aleta_watson/7367472.htm other random suggestions i have are thai food, mexican (not taco bell/bravo), maybe some weird new american fusion restaurants downtown... currently, it seems like jan. 24th is a good day for the next ethnic outing (i believe). i would say we could do it on the 19th, but people will probably want to study for finals, etc. bring up dates when you are avail/non-avail... i figure jan. 24th gives people enough time to start saving up money too! so yeah. party on dudes. i wanna see some magic happen in this group.

 hey guys, i have some pretty exciting/weird/interesting stories to tell.... call me regarding dinner at kazoo... woot woot... maybe i will study for finals or read or something. i am seriously that bored. you know it's bad when i want to do homework and it is already the weekend... word.

 haha, sucks to be maggie.

 i am at work and oh-so-bored. save me.

 ooo exciting!

 My parents are buying a Honda Accord for Marisa - they went out looking today and apparently found a really nice 94 Accord for her, and my dad knocked the price down from $4800 to $4600; he has to go make a $100 dollar deposit on it. But right now Willy is over, and he's telling my parents about this other Honda Accord that their Portugese Band director is selling - it's a 92, I think, grey, excellent condition, and is going for $3000. So now they're going to look into that one too. Which means that they're definately buying one for Marisa, and then my mom is telling my dad to just buy the other one for me since I'm going to need a car...which means I might have a car soon. I feel bad since I wanted to buy my own car so they wouldn't have to spend money, but oh well, I guess. Now I need to learn how to drive...and get a permit...and then a license.

 ok guys, big fish is playing at 7.05 i think (or 7.10) at the amc mercado 20... if ya'll are interested, call and let me know... i get off work around 6 and i am sitting here immensely bored out of my mind. so yeah. see you all lates.

 it starts at 8, goes till 11

 what time does the dance actually start?

 and here is the post winter ball scoop! after the dance (whenever we choose to leave) we can go...um, wherever. haha, i think we should hit up a coffee shop in full attire, but maybe that's just me. anyway, when we feel like it, we can come back to my house, and have a chill fire inside or out, weather depending and all. you are all more than welcome to speand the night as well!! my parents will be home, so if anyones parents are asking, then yeah, they will be. maybe bring sleeping bags and things for that...ah, and a change of clothes, cause you probabaly don't want your dress/suit smelling like camp fire smoke. so that's the story, came as beth,c all or talk to me if ya gots any questions. and remember: saturday night IS alright for fightin...haha

 Okay, here's the pre-winter ball scoop. We are having dinner at my house at 7. You can come at 6:30 to get ready and whatnot if you would like. We're having pasta and salad. So yeah, if anyone has any questions or needs directions or something talk to me at school or call my cell.

 beth's house para la cena

 What are we doing Pre-Winter Ball?

 whoot whoot

 no, she wanted him to buy...dun dun dun! PUFF PAINT!!! oooh ah, the wonders of things you can buy when you're 18....

 no, carlie, you want him to buy you hardcore porn. yummy.

 I went to Longs to drop off some film and my dad was like, oh, can you buy me some butane lighters for an experiment I'm doing in Chemistry? So i was like sure, I hope I am old enough to buy them. So Jason and I go, and I put the lighters down on the checkout thing and the lady (which i thought i recognized from when i went to pre-school at ATLC) was like, I'm gonna need to see some ID for you to buy these. So I was like, how old do you have to be, and she's like 18, so I was like, Jason, you better show her yours, seeing as I'm not 18. So that's ok, and then she's like your total is... so I go to pull the 10 dollar bill out of my back pocket and she's like, HE HAS TO PAY, so i was gonna give the ten to jason but she gave me this hard evil look so jason had to pay. So as we were leaving I was like, Jason, i didn't know it was that hard to buy lighters and then we get in the car and jason's like, you want me to buy ciggarettes for you too now? and i was like, suck a dick, trick. but then we went to tower and i got the new incubus cd and discovered i had 10 dollars on a tower card i thought was empty. go me!

 thank you, thank you very much

 i get a computer today. yay! i am no longer forced to use my sister's computer! rejoice!

 hey guys, if anyone wants to go see incubus, i think marissa and i are going to go. They are playing with the vines monday august 9th, at 8:00 pm at the HP Pavillion (or the shark tank). Tickets go on sale 04/04/04 at 10 am if anyone else wants to go, i coudl probably do a mass ticket buying. just give me a holla

 my name is jason and i like to suck large penii (that would be the plural of penis).

 and i've been all around the world. with mandy that is. ow!

 hey dawg! hey dawg hey dawg hey dawg i've been all around the world...

 Does anyone want to make a video commerical with me for Branham's announcements? Zehner and I are gonna make this really blunt video that basically states how stupid people at our school are because they can't tell the difference between a recycle bin and a trash can, and how disgusting our campus is compared to other schools. I want to go to the dump and film something there as well as at Branham, and yeah. Anyone up for making fun and lashing out at underclassmen?

 pull out those planners guys... events in store.... sat. march 6th - 2 pm - the polysics, crazy japanese spaz-techno-rock people are going to be playing at amoeba records in sf. ya'll are invited to come, if you'd like... you don't even have to watch them... just indulge in the sights and sounds of haight street on a lovely saturday afternoon. sat evening march 6th - cheesecake night at the cheesecake factory... oakridge or valley fair? you can be poopy and sit out on this... or you can be cool and eat cheese and cake and get fat... or you can come and sit and not eat cake too, whateva works... but i mean, a cake night! come on! my parents are going to be going earlier than planned... like, a month earlier. so, in lieu of this, a celebration is in place... this is tentative though, but shall most likely occur... three days after st. patrick's day party fest! sat march 20th - daytime all/day trip to sf and whatevers, if you can go and whatnot... then in the evening, everyone is invited to crash for the night, weather pending, maybe we can set up tents and sleep in the front yard... krispy kreme donuts are assured to follow. yay-ness! hit me back with ideas, i cans and i can'ts, the likes. love and harlots, ya'll.

 haha, i

 mandy, you already said that... march 25th to be exact.

 I have a new screen name for AIM. It's v is for alerie . So yeah. Bitches.

 Heeeey, I got "The Breakfast Club" for Easter, and so Amir and I are going to watch it since we've never seen the entire thing, and everyone is welcome to come over and watch it with us. Come over around 1 a mi casa

 TGISB! WHOO HOO!

 I think anyone that has an orgasm over the next week should scream SPRING BREAK when they climax. it would be appropriate. except for the fact that it's one of us having an orgasm...

 1 more day until spring break! orgasm!

 To add to my previous post, from now on all people are to call jason any one or all of his multiple names: Princess, Mijo, Slut, Herm, Bootch, and/or Snoogins. PS - Love you babes. HeHeHeHe PPS - My name is Inigo Montoya, you kill my father, prepare to die...Inconceivable...Revenge is a dish best served cold...For-ev-er...The night is young and you're so beautiful, here among the shadows beautiful lady...when I come back, I'll be bashin' skulls...I'm going to the bank, the blood bank...

 Well, since no one has said anything in a long long while I thought I'd just talk a bit about a few things. Let's see, my dad bought me a lap top yesterday. It is suspose to be here on the 24th of June. It's a dell and it's hella bling bling. He even got me the bamboo green snap on! (it goes on top and gives my computer personality!). Also, my dad is looking at getting me digital camera. Its a really cool little tiny one that is about the size of Kasso's but a little thicker and not as boxy, its more horizontal. If you didn't read the other post, Jason and I are going to Hawaii at the end of July. That should be quite interesting. Me and Celeste will be gettin it on. When I'm done with her, perhaps I'll move onto Jarrod. Mu-hu. Can't wait for SUSHI tonight! Adios! Only 2 weeks left. BOOTCH!!!

 eeeeeeee!!! hawaii over the summer with jason's family...oh celeste!

 hey all- i have a photobucket now. the album name is hellabomb. there are pictures from prom and winter ball, so check it out.

 yeah, this is kinda odd, but hey, whatever works ok, cya

 This is super weird. I'm not quite sure I like this new blogger thing going on. Well, anyways, only one more AP test to go! and then its home free or something like that.

 WHOA! Blogger is crazified now... I am impressed.

 damn I'm glad the calc test is over. Now I can blow my nose in peace. ::Sneeze::

 um, my mom wants people to help at the grad night booth at the carnival. i know that nobody really wants to do it, but it would be nice if you guys could help out. so if you're interested, just give me a call or whatever. thanks.

 O.C. SEASON FINALE IS TONIGHT! WHOO HOO!

 yo no puedo ir a la carnival este semana.

 sure, but jason webley is on friday too! and depending on what kind of a mood i am in, i might go up to berkeley for unspecified reasons... is anyone going to the carnival? i think i might be on sunday.

 anyone up for cubing on friday?

 oops, my bad

 is 7 at the los gatos cinema ok for everyone?

 I'm up for seeing it tonight too. Someone let me know what time we're going.

 it's also playing at century 23 tonight at 7, 7:40, 9:40, and 10:25, as another option. i'm up for seeing it tonight. holla back if up for it as well.

 ok guys, so group outing to the movies? either you're in or you're out, so yeah. this monday (being the 28th), fahrenheit 9/11 at the los gatos cinema downtown at either 7 or 9.30. word.

 hey, Susan and I are going to see Fahrenheit 9/11 tomorrow afternoon or something, is anyone else interested in coming?

 heey, apparently there's a fondue place called La Fondue, and on weeknights after 10, you can get chocolate fondue for just $8 per person. methinks that we should definately check this place out...maybe as a farewell to beth before she goes to europe??

 mmm, vacation on the beach sounds good. hey, who is going to the midnight movie tomorrow?? i think i'm going to the show with maggie, but i want to see mall rats afterwards, and i was wondering who else is going.

 ALSO AN AVERY TRIP WOULD BE GOOD TAMBIEN BUT IF WE WANT SOMETHING ON THE BEACH PERHAPS I FOUND A SITE FOR SANTA CRUZ AREA VACATION RENTALS

 mas spray paint! i even found a place online where i can design hats, aprons, or even CUPS! perfect dorm or house accessory! cups that say "posse degrassi" and other various catchy slogans! maybe even something that has all of our names on it hmm... IDEAS! IDEAS!

 fo sheazy, i was thinking about our stencil attempts, actually. i want to take my yellow shirt and make it looks like a taxi cab or something; but yes, i am up for the posse shirt idea, yaaay.

 estes park? mi familia had a fam reunion there in like the 70's and they still all talk about it (i think they might have even gotten t-shirts made) that gives me a good idea! how bout a posse t-shirt, mostly cause i really feel like designing some cool tees, or maybe even some shoes, hmm...

 Yes Mandy, that would be super cool! As you might know, I am off to Colorado tomorrow for my cousin's exciting wedding. She will be married in Estes(?) Park. Its a riveting 1/4 mile walk to the place of the ceremony and one has to stand during the entire ceremony. Boy do I love this half of the family too. To give you an idea they've lived on the east coast most of their lives and my cousins went to Duke. They aren't really California savvy. And now I get to meet all of their other relations. yay. Well, I will be back sometime Monday, and we can get back to our humping. For now, this has been Carlie, signing off.

 i could just use a vacation. period.

 hey kasso, do you own My Sassy Girl? and if you do, can i borrow it? i feel like watching it again. and yes, mandy, i would be interested. lavaburst!!!

 would anyone be interested in some type of a vacation rental, like in santa cruz/aptos area? well, if so, just respond

 i have a inspiron 5100

 Hey Maggie, Jason, Beth, and I all have Dell Inspiron 8600s. I like my computer a lot. I personally would never get a Mac and Berkeley is not a Mac school, so you might want to keep that in mind. Also, our computer's screens are "wide screen" aspect ratios. They aren't 4:3 aspect ratios like regular computer monitors are. So depending on which you'd rather have, keep that in mind but I think they sell the same laptop with the 4:3 aspect ratio if that;s what you want. My computer is really fast, has a lot of memory, and has a very high resolution screen. If you are going to order off the dell website my dad can probably find you a coupon, like 20% off or something. If you need help picking one out, my dad can also help because he's researched laptops for like the last year because he got my sister one, my mom one, and then me one. So yeah. If you want any other info just talk to me, like lovers do...

 hiya. ok so my mom is getting me a laptop, either a mac ibook/powerbook or a dell. for all those who have dells or macs, i was wondering what types you guys had and how they work out for you because right now i am trying to compare and contrast so i can find one that suits my needs. i think right now i am hooked on to the dells, i think an inspiron 600m or 1150, maybe even fancier. so yeah. any feedback on your little comps would be hella cool. mucho thanks!

 Jessie- sadly, I was not wined and dined, although Ryan had his eye on this really cute other guy...but I understand Jason wined and dined you...I hope he was up to your qualifications...hehe While attending orientation I got the joy of eating interesting DC food (there's nothing like weird egg rolls and cold chicken on a stick), being the only one in my suite (other than the girl with me) who got stuck in a double, being forced to dance very late at night to weird poka music designed to make you meet as many people as possible (I probably danced with 40 guys), getting stuck in a predominately male and almost completely Asian orientation group (there was one other white guy and only 3 other girls), being forced to discuss "serious" issues with people you've never met before, stuck for 3 straight hours and 6 hours a day in Warren lecture Hall 2001 (those chairs were soooooo hard!), among many many other exciting things. I can't wait for college. I hope your guyes orientations are as interesting as mine was!

 COUGHgouchosarebetterCOUGH hehe, have fun carlita, and don't let ryan wine and dine you too much...

 Well, guys, I'm off to beautiful san diego! I leave tomorrow morning at 8:30 and come back friday night. I'll miss you all. Don't do anything too exciting without me! I updated my photobucket a few days ago. I haven't uploaded the graduation pics because there's a lot of them and photobucket is being a bitch. I'm gonna take a lot of pics while I'm away so some certain people can see what they're missing by not going to UCSD! ::cough::bearssuck::cough::

 for those who inquired.... urlLink http://www.livejournal.com/users/okayfirstofall/157711.html#cutid1

 hey maggie and/or val. hand over the link to the picture of tyler macaulay!

 Today is Wednesday. We need to go to Pasta? tonight. Seriously. I am so craving it. Mmm... urlLink www.pastaq.com

 Guess what?!? Right now I am typing on my new laptop! i am sitting in my front room and at the same time I am watching a soccer game! Nothing like multi-tasking! I'll put some pictures up on my photobucket of it. It's hella sexy with its bamboo-green snap-on!

 Hey. So this is the game plan for Monday --- We're going to have our own little shindig right in the middle of the quad. Thus decided by Jessie and myself. We're thinking beach towels, chairs, tables, food, and 4 mats of Twister put together for one massive orgy Twister. And a boom box with better music than what leadership picks out. Hella. Soooooo, if you can, bring food and whatnot on Monday for lunch. I'll try to bring some dessert food or something. And I know we're all mentioned this between ourselves, but we really need to get everyone together so that we can all sign each other's yearbooks at someone's house for long periods of time. If anyone can volunteer their house or whatever, that'd be awesome. Or we could go to a park to do it, and have like a pinic or something. Either Monday after school or one of the other days after that would be good for signing, I think. Last thing -- we still need to exchange Senior Portraits, people, so maybe when we sign each other's yearbooks, we can swap pics as well. Rawr. My face is peeling. Goddamn sunburns.

 here's my harry potter info: century 21 @ 8:45 pm hope everyone can make it to that one

 ohh la la! a week from tomorrow we'll be out of this joint! yay! so... friday: finals, HARRY POTTER!, mayhem, and that yearbook signing thingy monday: finals, some sort of celebration? tuesday: senior brake-fast (8:30- 11:30), time capsules! wednesday: grad practice (8:30- 12) thursday: gradu-fricking-ation! yeah-uhh!, grad night (9:45pm- 5:30am) HELLA FUN TIMES AHEAD!

 well, i'm available whenever, except this weekend when i'll be at a bowling tournament in san diego/anaheim/i have no idea. i'll be gone from friday morning until sometime monday. feel free to text message or call me, i definitely won't mind the interuption from a long bus ride, anyways... gotta finish packing, and maybe somemore convincing my dad to get me a digital camera, it might work

 update. photobucket.

 update. photobucket.

 Sounds good Mandy, Let's think of a date for this so we can plan what to do. I liek the picture and autograph idea, very good!

 well, i mean that we should give group-wide "going away" presents altho not everyone is "going away" but most of us will be apart, so we need something that is identical and we can all have like a picture frame we all decorate with a pic of all of us or address books (that we again decorate together) that has all of our "new" addresses in it &nbsp; we should probably also, once the school year begins, send out care packages, maybe secret santa style so everyone gives and everyone gets something in return (which would probably be more organized) or just random people (from our group) send other people from our group whatever they want to send, which will probably happen anyways, altho the secret santa-style ensures everyone gets something in the mail

 you mean we all buy each other a gift? or we do a care package we send around?

 hey, i know we might have talked about this earlier, but i think we need to get cracking on a group gift/dorm-warming present before it's too late! does anyone have any ideas: - address books - picture frames - some type of decoration we could keep at home or where ever we all end up &nbsp; thanks! &nbsp;

 Ikea is the bane of my existence! But if people want to go, I'm game. I really have absolutely nothing else to do, so sure.

 Hey, I was wondering if anyone would be up for a trip to Ikea this week. Some of us mentioned it a litttle bit ago, and yeah, I thought it might provide to be amusing. Plus we could go early in the morning again and get yummy Ikea breakfast food. And yeah. &nbsp; So does anyone want to go to Ikea this week?

 what time are we meeting for the get-together? at 1 or afterwards? as far as i know i'm totally available. i don't really have a preference as to what restaurant we go to, so where ever's fine with me. so bring: money, movies, swim suit, change of clothes, anything else?

 This Saturday...ATTENTION! @ my house, reply as soon as possible, it is a last get together for all of us. Bring everyone's stuff to give back...beleive me..WE NEED TO! And bring food, swim suits, money, spare clothes, small gifts maybe, whatever you want. I was thinking, pool party, movie watching, dinner somewhere nice, a small posse las get together! It would last ALL day!

 So, this is more of a statement for people who haven't been around and stuff, and I direct it as KASSO, seeing as how it would be of importance to her. &nbsp; Anyway, we realized that Saturday evening is basically the last day most people are around. (minus Bryan) &nbsp; SO we need to something big & good, for use of the simplest kindergarten-vocabulary. &nbsp; Kasso-- would it be a good night to do your party/shindig/hooplah thing? I know it is kinda short notice- that's why I/we are asking, heh. &nbsp; &nbsp; What do you guys think? Can you be available Saturday night? Even if we don't do something at her house, we have to do SOMETHING !

 i'm free whenever, just give me a little bit of warning sounds like a grr-eat idea &nbsp; warning: ignore any post where i'm talking in third person, i'm most likely really tired and think it's funny and they don't usually make much sense kasso- when we do have this meeting can i please get my sweatshirt back? everyone- this meeting would be a great opportunity to give back anyone else's things or whatever, eventho it seems like we're all breaking up with each other, aww only a few more weeks left and currently i'm without my bring, arg, well, i'll get it back sometime friday or it might take longer, not sure, but my dad got a pt cruiser in the meantime altho, eventho it was MY car in the shop, i can't drive it without my dad in the car, arg &nbsp; anyways, just tell me when the meeting/party/orgy/bon voyage/mayhem/degrassi-ness is going to be, i'd be willing and able to help out

 Then why don't we just do it next week or this weekend, before you guyz leave? ..and besides...who said YOU GUYZ were invited haha just kidding, whatever...I freaking&nbsp;HATE blogger

 Carlie and I are in Hawaii from July 25th to August 3rd, so we wouldn't be there. Good idea though.

 Since me and Val are leaving soon and the 31st is the last time I can see her, I wanted to know if all of you would be free on the 31st and I could arrange a small Degrassi party including a big dinner, a pool party, movies...a day of stuff we love (even sushi!) (ragin waters?) (cubing?) (chick flicks) (fondue?) (children videos?) Is there a way you could let me know...It's our last day as a whole! Thank you and&nbsp;I hope all you Avery travelers had fun!

 hardcore indeed, mandy so excited! mandy also needs to pack and remember pop-tarts, is there anything else mandy needs to bring before mandy stops talking/writing in third person? ok, i'm done now, maybe i am or maybe mandy isn't?

 I am really excited about avery.&nbsp; I cannot wait until morning.&nbsp; I am importing cd's onto my laptop right now so I don't have to take cd's but its taking a while so I'm writing this because I've yet to write a post with a subject headline.&nbsp; Wow. That was hardcore.&nbsp; Well, time to put in a new cd.&nbsp; See ya'll in the morn.&nbsp; Sonic...mmmm.

 next summer, i want to be a dam tour guide, i already know exactly what i would say: &nbsp; hi, i'm mandy, and i'll be your dam tour guide today. you'll be able to buy dam souveneirs and dam post-cards in the dam gift shop. take all the dam pictures you want. does anyone have any dam questions?

 ...soon, probably this weekend, I was hoping that maybe we could have a Kareoke Revolutions 2 par-tay, if people were up for it. There's soooo many new characters and outfits [[as well as the old characters with 1 new outfit for each]], and the songs are fun stuff this time. Anyhow. Leave a comment if it sounds good.

 this is a test post of sorts for the new layout... comment and tell me what you think? let me know of any other changes you would like to be made by hitting the oh-so-useful comments link. cheerio!

 CROISSANTS AND PASTRIES AND DANISHES, mmmmmm.....

 Ok &nbsp;So since i love Sonic so much, i was thinking it could be possible to go up with the avery group for a little while and eat there and come back down as the others make their way up. Besides, the road there is very easy to drive and it's only an hour long (not even worse then goign to Santa Cruz through Highway 9) ANyways, if anyone is up to it contact me, i think Salcido and Paul might already go but then again it's no guarantee. If of course that is alright Avery groupies. Sicne i've gone to sonic with paul and laura&nbsp;&nbsp;before (on top of it) it will be pretty awesome. (Mandy too!!! that was freaking cool!!!) SHe knows SHE REMMEBERS!

 AVERY food plan:(as told by Carlie and remembered by me, so if's not exact, sorry) &nbsp; breakfast: - cereal - muffins - milk/juice? &nbsp; lunch: - sandwiches - sodas - something easy, maybe fast food &nbsp; dinner: - pasta w/ sauce - "make your own mexican"- burritos, tacos, quesadillas - more soda or milk or juice &nbsp; any special requests? (like croissants or pop tarts, etc.) we'll probably go food shopping on sunday night maybe after or before the container store's college night thingy

 I'm not sure if I'd be able to make the birthday bash/going-away party shindig...I'd probably be having my birthday celebration with all my relatives on that day, since the 9th and 10th will be hectic due to the rushing of getting everything packed away and ready. But if everyone can make that, then you should totally do it, it's a fun idea.

 Hey guys, I know its a little early but I was thinking for my birthday (which I was going to celebrate before my actual birthday so everyone who is going off to college and stuff can attend) that I could invite everyone and their parents and families and have a huge afternoon barbecue thingy at the beach on a weekend.&nbsp; I was thinking Sunday, the 8th of august. Before that I am on vacation, the 7th is val's b-day, and we were planning to be in longbeach that next weekend so yeah.&nbsp; if there are too many conflicts I guess its a nevermind on that idea.&nbsp; or it could be done during the week but then parents would have trouble coming because of work and what not and I wanted this to be like a going away party thingy where all the parents and all the kids could hang and be merry.&nbsp; so give me a holla and tell me what you think!

 Ah. I didn't realize the Avery Trip was this coming Monday -- I leave for Hawaii this Tuesday. Oh well, have fun guys. Keep me updated on So-Cal.

 hello love-mongrels!! &nbsp; Well, as you know, I can't really go on any nice trips with you all (sad face) buuuut... while we have free days on weekends and such, we need to start thinking about the stuff we want to do, cuase I know ideas have been brought up, but we better get thinking about it before everyone is gone!! &nbsp; So here are some of the ideas people have been talking about doing and some random new ones that may nto be well-liked but im trying to think of everything i can: &nbsp; -SF Zoo -Art Museums -Shopping days (Haight, gilroy outlets, wherever) -Sonic + neighbooring shops (okay i know you who are going on the trip will prolly do this, but I know for sure Laura and I were going to go back, so if anyone wants to come with us, that'd be even cooler!!) -That lake on Hicks everyone jumps off of -A night we dress up all fancy and go out to dinner -Figure out how to make an actual good-looking un-lame pomp. (as in hair. as in probably a girl thing. maybe not an event, more of an activity) -Uhhh i have a free ticket to Bonfante Gardens, so if anyone wants to go.. yea -we can have a sleepover in my SC Condo sometime, too probably maybe yea -OH and if anyone wants to come to CURIOSA (The Cure, etc, lots of other AWESOME bands... umm Maggie and I are going sooo yea! It will be good times!! check it out!) -Lazer tagging -Almaden&nbsp;Park (paddleboating, etc.) -Home movies night! (our old videos, like from camping,&nbsp;"The Pearl", that time Billy flashed Mr. Fernandez, etc.) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; UHH i have to go home from work now, but add ideas, yall!!! &nbsp; (yes i said YALL) - &nbsp;

 ok, so updated avery plans: not in e-mail form so as to not... mon-tues-wed we'll probably buy the necessary food items on sun night or if need be at the arnold supermercado and rent movies before leaving &nbsp; mon- Me, Carlie, Princess, Jairo, Val and maybe Beth leave between 9 and 11 - Sonic (or other lunch establishment) &amp; outlet mall shopping in Tracy - arrive, unpack, etc. - non-scary movie night - Ry and Mag leave around 9 or 10 (arrive around 1-2 ish depending on stops, speed, etc.) &nbsp; tues- - LAKE! (intertubing, floating, speer-fishing, etc.) - lounging - exploring - scary movie madness (Ry and Mag in charge) - not much sleeping depending on what movies we watch &nbsp; wed- - more lake or lounging or exloring - Princess needs to be home before 6 so either 1) we all go home by that time or 2) just Princess goes home at that time and everyone else goes a little later - probably a stop in Tracy for nourishment, starbucks, or maybe shoes on way home - back home i'll post what we'll be eating next so if anyone has any donations or special requests you can make those after i or someone posts &nbsp;

 little jason has a dinner party on wed night or maybe just a dinner

 hey Jason, porque necesitas to be home le Mercredi 21

 According to my parents, I absolutely have to be home by 6:00 on Wed. 21. Which messes things up unless we go Mon-Wed for Avery.

 wait, so what days are we camping?

 i got 3s on my aps...meh

 out of my 2 tests i have averaged a 1.5, how pathetic is that? MUCHO!

 how'd you get 3.8 as the average? with just the ones you passed, 4, 4, 3 is a 3.666 average. if you go for a total average, it's a 3. No wonder you didn't pass the calc therefore, all your base are belong to jason

 like ok. calculus: BIG FAT FAIL. chemistry: BIGGER FAT FAIL. actually, I am way more schway than Mr. Garnel shall ever be, so I get 500+ Schway points, which will count as Bear Bucks at Berkeley. Yay me. econ: 3 gov: 4 Wally can kiss my waddling Asian toushy. english: 4. Fuck your couch, Clinton. Therefore, I have an average score of 3.8, which when rounded up becomes a 4, which is overall not too shabby. And I, Maggie to the Maggadactyl Liu, have a coin slot. Which makes me better than all of you. All your base are belong to Maggie. Which is me. [[or is it...dun dun dun...]]

 AP Scores: all 5's (chem, calc, gov, econ). Been awhile since I posted anything

 Hey guys, got my ap scores. I got a 3 on calculus a 4 on gov and a 4 on econ. what all did you guys get?

 Hey, soooooo, the hypothetical plan for tonight -- Drive-ins at 9pm to see Anchorman, since it opens today [[that's the new Will Ferrell movie]]. And...that's about all the planning I've done so far. We'll need to get there early since it's Friday night, blah blah blah, and yeah.

 a-ha! attack of the in-n-out secret menu! i am excited to try one of these, to be "in the know", mwa ha ha... Animal Style - Your burger is cooked with mustard and instead of raw onions they are sauted. Extra pickles and extra "special sauce" complete the order. Animal Style Fries - Fries with cheese, sauce, and grilled onions. Choco-Vanilla Swirl Shake - You get the idea. Double Meat - A Double Double without the cheese. Flying Dutchman - Two beef patties cooked medium rare. Add two slices of cheese and thats it. Not even a bun! Fries well done - Extra, extra crispy fries. Grilled Cheese - No meat, just melted cheese, tomato, lettuce, and sauce on a bun. Home Run - When a car passes by the microphone without ordering and stops at the service window. Neapolitan Shake - A custom blend of chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry shakes. On the Sal - Lettuce and dressing. Yes, thats really it. Protein Style - Lettuce is wrapped around the burger instead of a bun. Wish Burger or Veggie Burger - No meat, no cheese. Just a bun, lettuce, tomato, and special sauce. 2 by 4 - Two beef patties with four slices of cheese. 3 by 3 - Three beef patties with three slices of cheese. 4 by 4 - Four beef patties with four slices of cheese. 4 by 6 - Four beef patties with six slices of cheese. (Actually you can get a burger with as many meat patties or cheese slices as you want. If you want 4 pieces of meat and 8 pieces of cheese tell them you want a 4-by-8.) 3 by Meat - Three meat patties and no cheese.

 what are the specifics of the bonfire plan for tonight? when are we going? who's going? who's driving? how long are we staying? are we going to go to bell's later to watch the fireworks (cuz he offered)? i have to go right now and visit my gparents, but i'll be back in like two hours, ok, my mom's rushing me so contact me if you have any information! thanks

 when is everyone leaving? has kasso left already? when does val leave? is there anything planned for a get-together or did i already miss it? arg, bowling trips, so much drama. so glad to be home! thanks to some for the text messages, they helped pass the time, altho by the end of the trip i had like no batt left, oh well, i have stories to tell, AND I NEED TO SEE EVERYONE!!! ok, hit up the cell or whatev, i think i'm suffering from a posse withdrawl!

 oh god, i'm going to be gone on saturday. noooo! okay val, we definitely need to see each other before saturday. that's absolutely necessary!

 hey. so, on saturday night, i'd like to have dessert with everyone at Bucca's. and if i can make a list, i'd like to have a scavenger hunt as well. i don't know the time yet, need to talk to my mom about when i'll be getting home and whatnot. but yeah. gifts aren't necessary, but if you're in the giving-mood, i'd appreciate a poster to decorate my dorm room with. yeeaahh. and i leave for field hockey camp on wednesday.
