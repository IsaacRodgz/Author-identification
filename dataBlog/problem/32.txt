 I just heard that on the radio and I'm horrified. Suicide, do you think? He was pretty unstable, thus my attraction to him, so it still does seem likely. He was probably drunk and fell in and drown. I hate to think that someone pushed him. I'll have to go check out some of his books at the library and read them in memorium. How many times did I make you watch "Gray's Anatomy" and "Monster in a Box"? I still want to see "Swimming to Cambodia." I wonder if IFC will play them again.

 karissa- did you hear that spalding grey's body was pulled out of the east river? he was missing, had attempted suicide before. it's a tragic thing really.

 cara- i should definitely be able to see you! daylight savings time begins on april 4 or 5 so i will then be on indiana time. right now i'm on central time. well, i'll still be on central time- you guys will go from eastern to central since you don't change your clocks. staying right on canal huh. that's really cool. you won't have to drive anywhere once you're there. emily grace really is a beautiful baby. i told my mom to go to the website and i could hear her smiling. we both like the picture of her fist on her cheek.

 Cara, thanks for the link. The wife says that could be the prettiest baby she's ever seen. I think we've found a condo in the city. Nothing spectacular, but it'll do. I never thought employment would require me to work this hard.

 We're going to Memphis in March- the weekend of March 20th actually. We'll only be there for 3 days. Too bad we'll miss you!

 Steph...I just made our reservations for vacation in New Orleans. We'll be staying at the Crowne Plaza from Sunday, April 11-Wednesday April 14. Do you think we'll be able to see you? Are you on the same time as Indiana or what?? Emily...are you going to be in Memphis in April or March? We're going to stay the night there on April 10. I'm so looking forward to a vacation......

 Just so you guys know, Emily Grace is on the growingfamily.com website now. http://www.growingfamily.com/webnursery/babypage_view.asp?URLID=4I7J9Y5U9V

 I hope Steve Buscemi gets meaner or something than he is now. Right now he's a wuss on the show. I am very disappointed in his character, actually. Steph, I'm so excited about vacation. I'm thrilled that it's warm down there. It will seem like a vacation, if that makes any sense. I'm just not looking forward to the long ass car ride. I told Bob that we should buy a whole bunch of new cds for the trip. He just got a new game, so I should be able to buy some cds!! Anyone heard the new Who song? I don't care what Eddie Vedder says, I don't really like it.

 Steph- love the new season so far- love that Steve Buscemi is on it. Marshall has only seen the first season- so it sucks because he doesn't really know what's going on- but I love it. We have Jen and John over to watch it every week (all 2 that it's been on) and it's really nice to see them then. PLEASE send the warm weather our way- I'm begging. We OFFICIALLY booked our honeymoon today. I even have an itinerary...yay!

 i recognized the love below part. i'm glad outkast is finally getting props. i hope they don't go too commercial and start sounding like everyone else though, since they have their own style. cat teets. that was nice of joe to sign your wedding webpage guestbook, em. how do you guys like the new season of the sopranos so far? i think it's already better than last year's. you know what- it's 80 degrees here. i am REALLY trying to send it your way since you guys have been having crappy weather!! cara- i think it will be really warm when you guys are here, but bring a jacket also (just in case).

 Dog balls.

 I am an Outkast fan- but don't recognize that....but then again if it's from the "new" one (new to us in Indy, not Chicago)- then that's why. Is this the same song that refers to being sued by Rosa Parks? Hey, do you guys remember the "ex"- Joe, from California? He signed our wedding webpage guestbook. He put a really nice message in it. I thought it was very sweet - so I just thought I'd share that....

 You guys aren't Outkast fans, huh?

 I kind of have to agree on the rose front. They are too strong a lot of the time, and while I don't think they smell like poo exactly , they can be completely overpowering. That's why I like wildflowers more. As for the speaker boxes, you've lost me. It does suggest a song, though, so maybe something was playing in the background? Here's a little something I thought was funny today: MOODS OF A WOMAN ================ An angel of truth and a dream of fiction, a woman is a bundle of contradiction, she's afraid of a wasp, will scream at a mouse, but will tackle her boyfriend alone in the house. Sour as vinegar, sweet as a rose, she'll kiss you one minute, then turn up her nose, she'll win you in range, enchant you in silk, she'll be stronger than brandy, milder than milk at times she'll be vengeful, merry and sad, she'll hate you like poison, and love you like mad! MOODS OF A MAN ================ Horny !!!

 Cara, WHAT? Either I'm REALLY missing something, or you had a few drinks before you posted ;)

 Roses really smell like poo poo. No speakerboxxxes...and definitely no love below...

 Hey Steph- I think we've changed our mind several times on the honeymoon- but we finally decided (and booked) Cancun. We'll be there for 4 nights/5 days- and I can't wait! 200 days exactly until we leave for that! (We're leaving the Monday after the wedding).

 And now a pause for a public service announcement: Join the campaign for free speech and cast your vote for the first amendment at http://www.stopfcc.com. Fed up with the government deciding what you can watch, read and listen to? In addition to tighter definitions of "indecency" and higher fines for broadcasters, the FCC is also talking about regulating cable and satellite broadcasts.

 hey guys, jen- how's parenthood?? how's little emily grace doing? i bet she's keeping you guys busy. :) cara- sounds like girl's night out isn't as fun as it's supposed to be. i hate it when one person dominates a conversation. tell them you'll have babies when you feel like having babies! ;) that must get annoying for people to ask you that. is your job any better? i hope you find one you like soon. em- i'm sure everything will work out just fine with all of your planning. you're a good planner/organizer and it sounds like it's going well. where are you going on your honeymoon again? i know you told me before. karissa- i don't mind at all about you telling mr casey hayes about me. what's his email?? i was thinking of him the other day. ny seems like the perfect place for that man. i still think he was one of the best teachers i ever had. chris- what made you guys decide to go with a condo? i saw the picture of the building, it looks like a cool little block. i think we have decided that if we don't get this one house (we'll know by the end of the month whether or not we can go check the inside out) on Louisiana (5 blocks from st charles), then we are going to renovate a house in central city (which is right in between the cbd and uptown-perfect location). there are a lot of renovations going on in that area so it's bringing it back from ghetto to, well, a restored neighborhood. :) the buildings are over 100 years old (some over 200) and they are bad ass. iron work, spiral staircases, lots of room. either way i'd be happy. i better get back to work. oh yeah, rissa- maybe you can give gus a treat after taking a bath and then he might be more willing to sit there for you. just a thought, i'm sure you've already done that.

 I found out last week that Mr. Hayes is at NYU. One of his students from Chatard is in my tai chi class. It was really kind of funny because we were just talking and she told me where she went to high school and then we both kind of fell apart laughing, thinking of our separate but similar high school marching band experiences. And yes, he did carry the threat "I'll rip off your head and piss in your eye sockets" with him to terrorize a whole new group of students. :) I just sent him an email telling him that Steph is in N.O. and Jen is a new mommy. I hope you guys don't mind. I just thought you'd like to know. :)

 Have you ever had to give an 18 pound cat a bath? I'll tell you, they don't like it very much. Gus scratched the hell out of my chest and even broke the skin on my chin. But don't worry, Chris; my BOOBIES are fine...:) He was not pleased with the vet's plan to make his skin non-flakey. I tried to reason with him. I told him it was for his own good, that it would build character, put hair on his chest, things like that. Of course, he already has hair on his chest, so this must have seemed like over-kill. But not only do I have to bathe him, I have to leave the shampoo on him for 15-20 minutes before I can rinse him off, so it's almost like two baths with forced captivity between them. By the end of it, we were both soaking wet, I was bleeding and he was pissed. I rubbed him dry as well as I could and then he hid under the couch until I went to bed. The good thing about having all of the cats angry with me is that they let me sleep straight through the night. That doesn't happen often. I don't even remember the last time I slept for 7 hours without either having to get up to go to the bathroom or get up and throw Lulu across the room to get her to stop licking my head, or both. But just think. We get to do this again next week and the week after. We'll see what I look like by the end of this experiment. I have a feeling that the presence of skin is going to be questionable at best.

 I've heard about the anal glands before- my old co-worker used to have to take her dog to do that monthly. I've never had that issue with my cats- THANK GOD. I hate the snow, I hate it hate it hate it. I'm grumpy because it's cold and it's been warm and sunny. And all I want to do is plan my honeymoon, but we have to wait until Marshall gets paid on Friday- since published fares are cheaper than bulk fares through travel agencies right now, we have to pay for most of our trip up front (which is what we were trying to avoid). Thank god I just got my tax refund. Did I tell you all I'm Graceland bound this weekend? I'm trying to talk Mr. Myers into going to do the mansion tour. But it is $18 to walk around a house. But we are definitely going to have lunch at BB King's place. Then my grandma is going to try to stuff my car full of old shit she is trying to get rid of before her and my great grandmother move. I now know that I get my persisitant vein from this grandmother. The guilt-inflicting vein comes from the other side (the pseudo-jewish side). I have exactly $120 left in our wedding account for expenses and whatnot. I wish I knew where all the money went (this is only half of the budget, my dad is still holding on to the rest). But everything is paid for- most vendors (except the food/drink at the reception, which is what the rest of the $ is for). So we just have to come up with $200 for the ceremony musicians and then another $336 for the rentals (chairs and such). Cara, you DEFINITELY had the right idea by having a destination wedding- if I were to do it all over. . . . But basically- we still need to save around $380 or so to pay for it all- but you know, with just over 6 months left, I'm not stressing- this will be good. We are all going to have so much fun.

 I'll tell you what. I just had one of the most disgusting experiences of my entire life. If you've just eaten, skip this and come back later. I'm not kidding. I almost lost my lunch. See, today was vet day. I took all of the cats to the vet. Ada and Gus went first, and that wasn't a big deal. I get to give Gus one bath a week for three weeks to get his dander problem under control, but I think we can handle it. I'll take my old apron from work home since it's practically water proof from all the glue, and that will help keep me fairly dry and clean. But then I took Lulu and Katy. You know how Lulu has a stinky butt? Yeah, well, apparently all animals have these anal glans they use to mark their territory, and since these are indoor cats, they don't get to use them and they have to be drained every once in a while to avoid messes on furniture, people, clothes, you get the picture. The vet showed me how to do it, and I about puked. It's not just the smell, though that's repulsive and disgusting. It's just gross. That's not something I ever need to see again, and the fact that she wants me to do this to all of them at least once a month is not making me a happy cat owner. So, I'm a little grossed out about that still. But on a more positive note, I did go up to Indy yesterday and helped Brian clean his house. When I got there, one of the ladies he works with was there with his friend Amy and we all hit that house hard. Every room was clean except for the bedroom, but even that we moved all of the boxes of crap out and into the storage room. His apartment was so hot we all agreed to clean in our underwear, which just made the whole experience a bit surreal. We turned down the thermostat and opened the windows, but wearing clothes still wasn't an option. It was just a weird time. We cleaned for about 6 or 7 hours straight, vacuuming as we unearthed more and more of the place, moving furniture, filling boxes and totes and moving them into the middle bedroom. After all that, only the main bedroom was still messy. I will say that I was a bit miffed that when Erica got home from work, she wasn't impressed, or at least didn't act like it, and then didn't even bother to try to help with anything else. True, we were all tired at this point and didn't end up doing much more, but if you have people cleaning your house when you're not there, the least you can do is say thanks. At least Brian was grateful and impressed. And he did quite a bit of work, too. We would assign him things to do while we cleaned and sorted around him. It was just easier that way. He did overfill the washer, though, and had to take out all of the clothes before it would work again. That was kind of funny, especially considering his picky laundry habits. Amy had been all ready to do a load of clothes and I told her that it might seem like a good idea, but if she didn't do it exactly right, Brian would have issues, so we pretty much left that to him. Oddly, a good time was had by all. There's nothing quite like hanging out in your underwear to unify a group of women. Anyway, today I'm all sore and tired and I can't decide if it's from the cleaning or carrying the cats to the vet. I didn't really start to hurt until I got home from the vet the first time, and now it's just getting worse. I have to go out and get the mail still, and I must say I'm not looking forward to carrying anything heavy. But I am glad that I'm not going to be doing bench work today. I just don't have the brain power for it. Treatment decisions, yes. It seems like that would take more brain work, but oddly, no. Don't ask me why. I have no idea. But what I really want is a nap, and this is after chugging a large chai, so that should tell you something. Ok, time to think about work...

 As disturbing as it may be- I just heard on the radio that greasy pork chop, Chris Benoit is the champion from WWE Wrestlemania. Now, I don't watch this anymore- but we all remember the greasy pork chop guy.....I just had to share. Hope everyone is doing well (Chris- BIG congrats! Can't wait to come up and see it!)

 Chris, we are sending good thoughts your way for you getting your condo! Tell the Land Rover yuppies to go to the Burbs!

 So Em is letting me check my e-mail at her house while we wait for the Sopranos to start and John is in the other room with the baby and Marshall playing video games but I wanted to thank everyone for all the good wishes for little Emily! Thank you for all the gifts and support that everyone has given over these last months. I can't believe that she is here and so beautiful and healthy! I can't wait for you all to meet her. And the next time we go out there is a round on me & John for everyone! Hopefully we will be able to get more pictures up for everyone soon! Oh yeah and Triple A watch out, John and I are sicking Ken Nunn on your butt!!!!

 So I'm sitting in Holly's kitchen for "girls night out", eating cornbeef and cabbage, irish soda bread and chocolate mousse pie, feeling totally isolated and inadequate as always. (The theme was St. Patrick's day if you couldn't guess it and she made all this shit from scratch.) I'm zoning out while they go on and on about their freakin' kids when Kristy finally looks at me and says, "Cara you must be so tired of us talking about this. How was your day?" I couldn't believe it! I was so excited! We were switching topics! My excitement didn't last long because I got about 5 sentences out....in mid-story no less and they change the damn subject! It was back to babies AGAIN, except the focus was still on me....it was WHEN we were going to have babies. I just shut up after that. But I realized that I don't really hate them and they don't annoy me all the time. I figured out there is just ONE of woman who takes over the conversations with ALL of us. That's Kristy. We listened to her talk for a good hour non-stop. We'd all listen and ask questions but the focus was always directed towards her. It was unbelievable. What's the point of this story? I don't know. I just had to bitch to someone.

 Congrats, Ms. Beaverhausen! Hope everything works out. Em, tread lightly with that house. It's not far from my grandma and home values in that area have plummeted. She's trying to move away because of the crime. It looks nice though... Tomorrow I think we are going to grab 10 cd's, get in the car and drive to an unknown destination, far far away. I'm fucking exhausted. Dog balls to you all and have an excellent weekend.

 Well, they accepted my full asking price offer, which is great and happy and there should be celebrating. The thing is, now we need to start working on making it a financially viable option. Having no money really makes buying a house or anything else really hard. My mortgage broker is working on it, but it's looking like I'm going to have to borrow more money from my Dad than I originally thought. I'm going to see what day next week he can come down and then we'll make an appointment to meet with Lisa and see what we can work out. So, while we won a major battle by getting the people to accept my offer, we still have the war to deal with. I'll keep you all posted, though. I think I'm going to go home and have a nap.

 Em...I saw the house you're going to look at. I'm curious about the kitchen. Other than that, the inside looks pretty good. It seems to be a huge house. I hope it all goes well. Karissa...I just remember trying to make a bid on our house. We both agreed that if we didnt' get this house, we were going to take a break from looking for a while. We would be too heartbroken to look at anything else. I wish you the best of luck. It's ok about the floors. We did it all ourselves and only needed to rent the air nailer. We had everything or could borrow it from someone. You would believe how many tools Bob has accumulated in a year. I think he has every kind of saw they make now. He got 3 for Christmas!

 No rushes rissa- we are just anxious for you! Best wishes! And if it doesn't come through- then something else out there was meant for you! I love that I get to leave early today and I wasn't expecting it. Turns out one of our Toronto visitors needs a ride to the airport and since I live in Indy it is more on my way than anyone else....yes, this is nice. Gotta hate leaving early on a Friday.

 Dude, give me time to get into work and call people and make arrangements! Here's the deal on the condo. We got word yesterday that another offer had been made, one closer to the asking price, and that the people were countering them. So, last night, after calling my Dad to see if he could help me out, we placed a full asking price offer. I called my mortgage broker this morning and told her what was going on and she said she'd try to see if I can be approved for the full amount, but it's nice to know I can fall back on Dad if I need to. I don't want to borrow money from him, and he knows it, but this place is worth it. No pictures yet. I just tried to pull up the file at homefinder and it says that it doesn't exist, which really doesn't surprise me since they have two offers within the first days of it coming on the market. It's going to be sold, probably by the end of today, and with any luck, to me. Is it normal to want to sit down and cry at this point? I didn't even realize I was stressed until yesterday. At first I was just excited, but now I will admit that I'm a mess. It'll all be over soon. I just hate that I can't do anything right now. It's all sitting and waiting. Also, for people buying things like siding and windows and whatnot, let me know what you need and we can go get estimates from Rob. He works at American Wholesalers and can get you all a great deal on whatever you need. If I'd thought about it, Cara, I would have given you his contact information for flooring. Sorry about that.

 Oh, and Karissa- any word on the condo yet??? I really hope we can see a listing or pics soon!

 Apparently that house wasn't meant for us either- it went off the market- YESTERDAY. Weird..you can't even get to the link of the house now. BUT I found another one I want to see. www.fctucker.com - then go to search by street and enter the MLS 2334857 - the outside would need some work- probably new siding after awhile- BUT the inside wood work and stuff is so neat. I want to go see it to see how much work it would really be. The area is sort of on a line of good/not so good- so we really have to go check it out anyway...but I'm in love with the woodwork.

 Emily, I know where that is! It's not even a mile away from where I grew up! I lived two subdivisions over!! That's awesome. If you wanna see how close it is, my old address was 7806 Cannonade Dr.

 I think all of us will be buying homes within the next year or so...weird... We are going to look at this one this weekend: http://remax.realtor.com/Prop/1034690779&gate=remax The one we really loved and jumped on just as someone made an offer is gone. The person who made the offer paid CASH for the house- and they paid the asking price. We couldn't really even try to compete with that.

 Em---As far as I know, I'll be there. Who knows about Bob and his work schedule. South Bend is an hour ahead of me, right? I'll need directions unless Bob knows where that is. If anyone wants to spend the night after Em's party, let me know. We got room and would love the company. Steph---It's kind of fun to fix up a house but it seems like it's never done. We still have about 5,000 things left on the list that we want to do. We're learning a lot. We got a book from Home Depot about home repair and it's been really helpful. It goes over everything, it seems. The bathroom is looking to be our hardest task so far. It makes putting the hardwood floors down a piece of cake! I wish we had enough money to get it down professionally. Ever watch that show on HGTV...where three designers come up with plans for a house and the homeowners choose which one they like? I forget the name of it now...I wish I was rich enough to do that. I could have a kick ass bathroom. Who ever buys a house is getting a home depot gift card from me. Trust me, you'll be there once a week at least. Whether it's brand new or a hundred years old, you'll need something.

 April 3rd- Party time in South Bend! Ok all- On Friday, April 2- I have to attend my grandfathers memorial service in Elkhart- but we will be spending the weekend in South Bend. Marshall is arranging a small soire to celebrate my 27 years. We will meet at 6:00 at Barnaby's pizza (not sure which one just yet) and then off to drink and galavant through the evening. Everyone is invited- no one is expected (so in other words, I totally understand if you can't come). We have to leave mid-day on Sunday to come back to Indy- but I'd love to see you guys (Chris and Cara especially)- all SO's are invited as well. Jen and John may come up depending on his work schedule- and Karissa said maybe too..... just wanted to spread the cheer.

 em- i'm not sure if it's the same way with marshall, but my insurance provider is also blue cross/sheild hmo, there's no other brand or provider with it- just that. maybe his is the same? sounds like you are really fixing your house up nice and to your own style, cara. i can't wait until we can do that. we drove by some houses yesterday evening. we got out and looked around the outside and the yard. (most of them are ones that noone lives in because they need renovation) a couple of them are REALLY nice. one that we love could be a grand and awesome house. it's huge and it's one of those old houses with high ceilings and fancy woodworking and ironwork and staircases and all that. it's on the blighted list so we don't know how much it would be until we found the owner. but i think we are going to wait to do something that big after we buy a smaller house/smaller project first. there's a single 3 blocks from st charles that's $26k that we could easily afford to fix up NICE. we'll see. karissa, i hope you get that condo. you sound excited about it. where is it at?

 His carrier should be Anthem. I'm on the same plan and that's who my provider is. And don't even try to navigate the website. That's enough to make you want to find a deer rifle and a rooftop. Let me see if I can find a link to the condo. There's no picture yet, because, like I said, yesterday was its first day on the market, but just reading about it should give you warm fuzzies...:) Well, it's not showing up at Homefinder, but if I see it, I'll let you know. We'll hope that the fact it's not up means that they have either accepted my offer or are countering me. I'll let you guys know when I know.

 Ok- I have to "man" vent. Why is it that you can ask a question several different ways and STILL not get an answer. How many different ways can you ask "Who is your insurance provider?". I even listed choices. It's like the text or voice coming from me is nothing but "blah blah blah". In October, we'll be on the same insurance- but until then, I'm on my own. Well, my company is getting new insurance (good, and cheaper)- but Marshall and I would like to go ahead and establish ourselves at a family doctor. The following has been cut/pasted from our email's this morning: ---------------------- E:Is your medical insurance through Anthem? M:I'm Blue Cross Blue Shield...PPO, non-ppo... E:Ok- but is the brand anthem? Like what website do you look up providers on? I have to fill out my new insurance info- and have to put down a primary care provider- so I sort of have to pick off the list M: Oh, I went with a plan where I didn't have to have a primary care provider... E: *sigh* Ok.honeydoes your card have the little Anthem logo on it? I just need a yes or no here. Because it would be nice if we could pick the same family doctor. And while YOU dont have to have a PCP, I do- so I need to know if any of the doctors I will list (even though I can change later) will be in network for you. If you are an Anthem customer, then it automatically would be- but I just need to know. OR Do any of these doctors appear on your list? (copied and pasted a list from the anthem website) It's like freaking pulling teeth with an out-of-network dentist....ARGH!!!!!

 So miss Karissa- do we get a link to this condo?

 I put a bid on a condo. It's gorgeous and I need all of the happy thoughts you guys can muster that they will accept an offer under 60,000. But Ronita has been having big family crisies, one after another. Her uncle just died, and that's on top of the two funerals she went to two weeks ago. This was her mom's brother and her mom isn't handling it well, so she's trying to deal with that as well as run a business. Knowing this, I am much more patient and understanding. She's a great realtor; she's just going through a string of family deathes. This is the 3rd, though, so we'll hope for no more. I'll find out tomorrow if my offer is accepted or countered. I don't care if they counter as long as we can eventually settle on something I can afford. The only problem is that condos sell so fast in this town, people can really ask whatever they want and they are probably going to get it. This place is perfect for me, with the small exception of being on the second floor (I know, Em; you don't even have to say it). It even comes with a washer and dryer and all new appliances and lots of storage space and I swear when I saw the laundry room, I almost had one right then and there. Oh, the agony of waiting!

 If you feel your realtor is not giving you enough attention, dump her. You've got money to spend and she should work for that commission. I think they get commission from a buyer....they might only from the seller. I don't remember. I'm in the mood to paint something. I've run out of rooms to paint, however. I don't want to do my bathroom until I know how it's going to be remodeled. I still have a faint hope for a spa bathtub. Maybe Liz will let me use hers when she moves into the condo. :) I'm kidding....that would be weird. My cat has not bitten my toes now for two nights in a row. Maybe my threats of getting a new kitty has straightened him out. I haven't slept this well in a long time. Someone write me at work and entertain/distract me. I'm in hell, you know. Give the girl some ice water.

 just a quick note- you can buy papier mache kits at Hobby Lobby... Are you kidding me? Someone is too lazy to mix FLOUR AND WATER and rip newspaper? I can understand buying pre-formed chickenwire for the pinata form- but come on people- rip the newspaper!

 The dinosaur pinata is not stuffed, but it is the kind you get to beat to death with a stick. Which is why it came to stay with me. It doesn't seem to matter how hard you hit it, that chicken wire isn't going to give. In elementary school we made a pinata out of papier mache for a class project. I think we need to do more papier mache. I'm going to look at some houses at lunch today. I don't know what I'm going to see, though. Ronita hasn't sent me any realtor sheets yet. My id is currently arguing with my superego about whether I should be a little pissy at feeling ignored by my realtor. I'm still not sure who's going to win. We'll see how I feel once I see the houses. Mr. Hayes wrote back today! Apparently Javi talks to him about once a day, a fact that doesn't really shock me much. his email is cjh254@nyu.edu. He's the assistant director of the NYC Gay Men's Chorus! How awesome is that? He's conducted in Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center. How cool is our teacher? You can check out my bio at www.nycgmc.org Follow the links to "about us" and then to "staff" That will help fill in the blanks with what I have and am doing with my life. I'm all excited. Nina and Dylan are coming down this weekend! Woo-hoo! Sure, I may have to sit through Nina fishing some afternoon, but we'll go out for Mexican and we'll make spaghetti, so it's going to be a winning weekend all around. :) Dylan fell into a well last weekend, though. They were visiting our friend Kelly, the one who had the baby 5 weeks early, and Dylan was playing outside and fell into the dry well pit. I'm just glad it was dry. The cover they had over it had rotted away so when he stepped on it, all 35 pounds or so of him, it collapsed under his feet. I'll tell you, that boy has someone watching out for him. He has a bump on his head and his butt is a little bruised, but other than that, he's fine. How weird is it to hear about somebody falling into a well these days? And I was just excited it was no longer Tuesday...:)

 I was going to point out that pinatas.com has a monkey pinata.

 How hard is it to find online? http://www.partysolver.com/catalog/item_display.pcgi?fm_itemid=4092&fm_relitem=1 Chris- get to crappin'

 Not sure what open weekends I have in May just yet- I think I have to go out of town the first two weekends for work (god please find me another job!). Is it possible to have a love affair with tennis shoes? I just got a brand new pair of New Balance and I won't take them off. Karissa informed me that I've been relatively MIA on the blogger- sorry for that. We just had the trip to Memphis this weekend. Other than fighting at Graceland- we had a great time. The drive was good- the visit was good- BB King's restaurant was GREAT. Saw an excellent blues band and had a wonderful time. Then on Sunday we had lunch at Isaac Hayes restaurant and saw a cool jazz band. We also played mini-golf. He beat me by ONE point- I was pissed. However, I still made him buy me a $10 costume jewelry ring. It's totally gawdy, and I love it. It's all blue and turquoise clear stones- and it's adjustable. How hard could it be to make a monkey pinata?

 I have an urge to dance.

 I'll go back and check out the donkey pinata and see if it is stuffed or non-stuffed. I'm booked the first two weekends in May, but the 15th, 22nd, or 29th are free. If anyone finds a monkey pinata, I'll crap myself.

 Karissa, is the pinata already stuffed with candy? Is it one that you hit with a stick or the pull string variety? We're serious about our pinatas. I'm free pretty much anytime in May, I think. Nothing going on that I can think of except for maybe my father-in-law's birthday. Has anyone else seen the MTV show "I want a Celebrity Face?" The twins who want to look like Brad Pitt were obsessive and weird. I would worry if I were their parents. Next time I see it, I'm going to count how many times they say "Brad Pitt." I wonder what Brad thinks of the whole thing.....

 Yeah, that's what I was afraid of. Now I'm going to have to become a dog-stalker. I'm going to have to get one of those unmarked white CIA vans and start driving it by their house, bug their phones, tap their computers, and eventually steal Seamus away for a quick ice cream cone and belly rub. *sigh* If you want to have dualling pinatas, I have one shaped like a dinosaur in my closet from Jake's birthday two years ago. It's amazing how breakable pinatas aren't. We were going to dress him up like a goat for Chinese New Year and then beat the crap out of him, but we never got around to it. Jen, what color is your car? Give the Peanut kisses on the head for me. :)

 Any weekend is good for me and John for a Cinco party. John bought Emily and I a new car this past week. He bought us a 2003 Mazda Protoge. It's so cute. Nothing else new going on. Emily is growing day-by-day. At her last dr vist she weighed 6 lbs 6 ozs!

 Our new address will be 930 North Honore (honor-RAY), Chicago, IL 60622. Things I like to receive in the mail: blank checks, Hickory Farms gift packages, letters written on perfumed paper, and my cable bill. Re: Seamus - I'm pretty sure he and the Petros would be a package deal! He's a good dog, but is he THAT good?? I kid because I love. We went to the anti-war rally march downtown on Saturday. Part of me felt good about it and part of me wanted to shake the hippies and tell them to get jobs and stop living off their parents. Yes, I am a paradox. Got some cool B/W pics though. Cara, I saw a pinata for sale at our neighborhood grocery. It was a large paper mache donkey selling for $9.99. I havent priced many pinatas, but that seems like a steal. Speaking of pinatas, anyone wanna have a Cinco de Mayo party sometime in May? We have many things to celebrate - baby, spring, life, tequila. We could beat the shit out of a paper mache donkey using a golf club. Throw out available weekends and we'll work something out.

 Well, Jacob is now officially 5 years old. We had a lovely birthday weekend! Now I just have to remember to call my Dad in two days and wish him a happy birthday. I should also drop a card in the mail. Which reminds me, Chris, I don't have an address for you, and I know you're moving, but at some point I'd like to know that if I ever want to send something to you, I can. Jen, I don't have an address for you, either. And I don't think I have a current address for you either, Steph. Not surprising that I'm not good at mail, huh? Well, I'm trying to get better at it, so we'll see what happens. I had a dream about Jen D. Cara, I think you were in the car, sitting in the backseat, talking to her out the window. I was driving, but there was something beside me that made it impossible for me to talk to her out the passenger side window. I don't remember what you two were talking about, but I remember finally getting frustrated because she kept asking you things to ask me so finally I just said, "for Christ's sake, just tell her to get in the stupid car and we'll take her where she needs to go!" It was all just weird. I really miss Seamus. Chris, next time you're down here, you'll have to steal him for an hour or so so I can see him. He's a good dog and I wish I could see him more often. I just don't want to have to deal with Jen to do it. No offense, I just don't have the patience. Oh, and then this morning I dreamed that I took off my skin and was cleaning it. This wasn't gross or anything. I still has skin, but I was going over the everyday skin with a toothbrush to get it cleaned up. Very strange. Last Thursday I went up to Indy for a birthday party for one of Brian's friends. There is a long drawn out story as to why I was finally talked into going up, but I'm not going to get into it now. I took some DVDs that my students loaned me just in case we needed something to do. Well, we didn't watch them, but then I forgot to put them in my bag the next morning, so I called Brian's cell from 465 and he said he would bring them by my house that weekend and drop them off so I wouldn't have to turn around and go back right then or make another trip up this week to get them. So, as I'm driving, it strikes me that I can make him a present. I think of a whole lot of little presents, one for each day of the week, would be really cool. So I put them all in an envelope, hung them off the doorknob, and went on my merry way to Chicago with my folks. I reminded Brian three times, at his request, to bring the movies down, and told him there was something waiting for him on my door. I got home last night, and it was still there. I was pissed. As I unpacked and put stuff away, I just yelled and carried on. Then, I sat down and labeled all of the pictures I had developed over the weekend and put them all in the photo album while watching a cheesy made-for-TV movie on the Hallmark channel, and then I went to bed. At 12:30, someone touched my shoulder. A dark figure leaned over my bed, fuzzy hair silhouetted by the faint light of my bedroom window. I was instantly scared and tried to find a defensive position, but since I was still pretty much asleep, my body wasn't responding. It was Brian, come to drop off the DVDs. Apparently I pulled a Cara. He had knocked on my window, knocked on my door, gone up to his car to get his key to my house, and knocked on my bedroom door before coming over to wake me up and let me know he was there. I was so sound asleep no sound was getting in. I thought it was strange, though. First, my front door is loud enough to wake the dead, so sleeping through that was amazing enough, but then not to hear someone come in my room is very unusual. Since high school, as soon as my parents would come in to wake me up for school, I was awake as soon as they crossed the threshold, whether I moved or not. But it was such a nice surprise! He didn't stay, but I did get the videos back and I was able to give him his present, so I was a happy girl. Even if he did almost literally scare the piss out of me...:)

 No, but it was the only guy who came out that day. Even if someone is a little cheaper, it's still too much. It freaked us out.

 is there only one company that does driveways there or something?

 $7,000 just for the driveway . If we want to fix the sidewalk, it will be another $1,500. Needless to say, we don't have it. Let's pray the asphalt is cheaper.

 Cara, $10,000? Chris, I think the $900 is pretty close...

 I forgot to guess about the daycare....um...$900 a month is my guess.

 Chris...Oh no. You're waaay off. Bob even guessed $4,000 and that wasn't even close.

 I guess $2,425. Any one of you future parents wanna guess how much monthly child daycare will cost for a 6 month old in Chicago? Shit, indeed. Em, dont think Liz and I are gonna make it to SB. Hope you have a terrific birthday! Hey, did you buy that house???

 You know things are not going well when the guy who writes up the estimate for a new driveway, hands it to you and says "you're going to shit." Any one of you future homeowneres wanna take a guess how much it is to tear up our old driveway and pour in new concrete?

 Jen just called and wanted me to post that little Emily is almost 7 lbs! 6 lbs 14 oz to be exact (that's how big I was when born BTW!)

 Em...No. I didn't get anything. The girlfriend didn't fall for it either. I'm the only guilible one in the dictionary today.

 Cara- did you get my email reply?

 I still wouldn't let Marshall quit his job if he won $50K- $50 MIL- maybe... :)

 This guy at work just emailed his girlfriend saying that he won $50,000 from the lottery and is going to quit his job.

 Normally you would have gotten me, but one of my students reminded me yesterday that today was April Fools', so I just kind of guessed that's what you were doing. You've put in too much effort toward the wedding, and too many non-refundable deposits, so I figured you were going with the spirit of the day. :) It's unusual for me to know what day of the week it is, let alone month or pseudo-holiday. Not that I wouldn't have been excited for you had you really gone to Vegas...:)

 OH SHIT. You totally got me. I was so upset...

 Bah Humbug- but your right :) Can't pull anything by you -

 Uh, huh. Sure. It's April Fools day. You had me for a minute, girlie. :) I was thinking of practical jokes that wouldn't really be that funny and I came up with telling your significant other that you just found out your pharmacy made a big mistake and gave your fertility pills instead of birth control and now you're pregnant with a litter. Yours is definitely happier news, though. :) Any other suggestions for bad April Fools jokes?

 BIG NEWS!!!! The best birthday present ever. . . . So- though it's been fun- wedding planning has been so stressful, and probably the only source of arguement between me and Marshall. So last night- we made a decision- TO ELOPE! We have to go to South Bend tomorrow for my grandfather's memorial service. We are going to fly out of Chicago afterwards straight to Vegas and get hitched! I'm so excited I can hardly sit still today. I know we had made a lot of plans this weekend to hang out with some friends and celebrate my birthday on Saturday- but this just works out so much better. No stress, no more money and it will be perfect!!!! I can't wait to be MRS. Myers!!!!

 hey jen, glad to see your back posting! florida is nice, i'm glad you got to go. can't go wrong with warm weather. how did you like the parts of disneyworld that you saw? that's great that you're enjoying being a mother. i'm sure it's like nothing else. karissa- congratulations on your new place! hopefully em and i will get places soon also. it's getting there... better get back to work :(

 Congrats Karissa on the new digs. Congrats Chris about the little bambito on the way! You are in for the ride of your life. Aside from being sleep deprived and the fact that everytime I go to eat Emily will wake from a deep sleep and start screaming this is the most rewarding thing I have ever done! John & I just got back from sunny Florida. John had an unexpected 4 day weekend so he decided to take Emily and me on a spur of the moment road trip to someplace we've never been before so we went to Orlando. The minute John drove into Fl he fell in love. But we had a great time. We went to a Pacers/Magic game on Friday night, Epcot Center on Saturday and Daytona Beach on Sunday. Hope all is well with everyone!

 You know, I've heard of a clogged nose moving into the chest and making a cough- but I've never heard of it moving back up. Now I'm hardly coughing (good)- but still can't breathe (bad). The pressure in my sinuses is awful! I think I might have to make a CVS run! Damn colds!

 Well, Em, you're in luck. I won't be able to move in until Sunday! Aren't you the lucky girl? :) Ok, so I'm in a way better mood now than I was earlier. Herb just told me that there are Correctional Facility Officer positions open at the Bloomington jail. How funny would that be? I'd get a taser! Just what we want. Me, armed with a cattle prod. I could laugh about that for hours! I'm going to go down and put in an application for shits and giggles, but I'm sure Target is going to be the place I'll work. Hey, the jail pays more than I'm making here right now. Imagine how quickly I'd be able to pay off my credit card debt then. And my Mom would love it! :) That's just too funny for words. It would also help my stripping career since I wouldn't have to buy a fake uniform...

 Karissa- You know I would be 100% in to helping you move- but I will be out of town for work that weekend, and I can't get out of it. I will get back late on Saturday- so I could help on Sunday if you still need it- so let me know. Don't beat yourself up about borrowing the money from your parents- be thankful that they are in a position to help you. This will be so much more financially sound for you in the long run and will be such an ego-boost to OWN your own place instead of renting. I don't think that there is anything wrong with taking a second job. In fact, I've thought about it- but with wedding planning and the travelling I do- it's too hard right now. But I just applied for a job at AUL in Indy- so if I got that, it woudl be cool. Anyway- I know it will work out for the best- and your parents are behind you on this- that's a REALLY great thing! Let me know about Sunday the 17th.

 So, here's the condo update. First, Mom and Dad loved the place. Second, I'm going to be borrowing a helluva lot more money from my parents than I originally thought. Dad's pretty cool about it, but I really don't like the idea. Third, I'm going to go to Target today and see about getting a second job. Mom has been saying for years that I should do that, and it wasn't until Lisa said it yesterday that it really hit home how necessary it is going to be. There's just no way I'm going to be able to make ends meet if I don't go out and find something else. Since the Target is new and close to where my place will be, it looks like a good choice. If that doesn't work, I'll go to Lowes and Menards and Petsmart and a million other places in town and put in even more apps. It's time for me to get off my butt and get some work done. And I really hate it. But that's what grown-up responsibility is all about, right? And here's the really crappy part. I'm going to bet there is no way I'm going to be able to afford movers, so if you all are free the weekend of 16 May and you feel like hauling my crap around, I would really appreciate the help. I know that's a Sunday, but if we get all of the money crap worked out, the 15th is going to be the closing date and I'll take possession at midnight on the 16th. I intend to be asleep at that moment, but the next day will be a good time to lug crap around. I know I'm saying crap a lot, but I'm not in the best mood at the moment and the mere fact that I own stuff is just pissing me off. I'm glad I'll be getting a place of my own. I'm ecstatic about having my own washer and dryer and a guest room, but the fact that I'm going to be borrowing so much money from my Dad is really upsetting. I feel like he has to bail me out financially all the time. He's been doing it since I was a Freshman and I thought I was finally getting to a place where I wouldn't have to depend on him for much anymore. Well, that's not happening. I know, it's ok to borrow money from your parents. Mine borrowed from Grandpa Brown when they bought both houses. This is a natural extension of being parents. It just makes my inner child howl in indignation. I have a good job, one I enjoy, but it barely pays me enough to live on. I don't remember my parents ever having to work two jobs, but they had each other. It will all be worth it, I know, but right now it just makes me tired. We'll celebrate after the move with a couple of loads of laundry.

 Steph...I'll be on vacation in 9 days! Is there any chance we would get to see you? We'll be in New Orleans from April 11-14. I know that's during the week but let me know if you wanna get dinner or something.

 cara, that's a weird way to approach someone. call them at work to let them know you're sending an email. i have to agree with you, too little too late. she probably won't ever understand that, but oh well. my plates expire today but i can't register my car here until i get a "letter of donation" from my mom. louisiana is so weird and difficult about registering a car here. they have all these little things that you have to make sure you get notarized and crap. oh well.

 Congratulations Chris! I keep thinking about when we went out to dinner and were discussing baby names! Did you know then?? AND YOU DIDNT TELL ME?! :) Cara Clark sounds good to me. Steph...It was the weirdest thing. She called me AT WORK and asked for my email address. I haven't spoken to her since the wedding. She emailed me and said that she was very hurt that I "excommunicated" her without even asking for an explanation for what happened. She thought that I was only pissed about missing the bachelorette party. She said that she made the effort to come to Vegas to support me and I treated her like crap. She had very little money at the time and she got fired from her job for going. She said that she wanted to be friends again and went on to tell me about her life. I wrote her back and told her that we made an effort to contact her for the bachelorette party and she didn't show up. She also didn't show up for my shower or the engagment party even though she said she would. She made up these stupid lies about why she didn't show up. I told her that too many of my friends have been hurt by her to make it worth any effort and that we were no longer friends. I said that I didn't wish her any ill will and only the best of luck. She made no apologies and just accused me of everything through the whole email. Too little...too late. Sorry.

 chris- congratulations!!!!!!

 cara- what did jenny d. say to you?? i can't believe she even said anything after all the crap that's happened. bty, she still has my shirt. :) not a big deal, i just think it's funny that even after i confronted her about it she did nothing. oh well.

 I already have one other Emily, I'll save the $40 and open it up to everyone else. Chris- PLEASE send my congrats to Liz as well. I am SO happy for you guys! This is just so exciting. The vision of the fountain kids is becoming more clear- That is SO cool!

 Yup, the wife is one month or slightly less. The baby should be due in mid-December, so yes, we got our Monkey baby! I would call each of you but figured this was a quicker way to spread the word. We're both just incredibly excited about it! Once again, for $40 we'll name our child after you.

 Just FYI for anyone who wants to come to the birthday gettogether in South Bend this weekend- it's on Saturday- starting at 6pm at Barnaby's 713 E Jefferson Blvd South Bend, IN 46617-2902 After that we'll go out drinking or whatever- no big deal. I'm not expecting gifts or anything- just want to have fun together. If you can't make it- that's cool too.

 OH MY GODS!!!!! CONGRATULATIONS!!!!! Yea for Slappy! Or should we call you Supersperm! Or The Sperminator! Or Chris!!!! Yea!!! Now I'm all excited. :):):):):):) So many babies, so little time! How far along is she? How is she holding up? Is she having morning sickness? When can we start the betting pool? Do you have a digital camera so you can send us all pictures as she gets bigger? And what's a "meet Jesus" moment?

 *wiping eyes* Chris- did I read that right? Are you guys expecting? I want to get all excited, but not until I heard that for sure....

 Wow, Cara. My cousin had a "meet Jesus" moment. I talked to her last night and she didnt mention anything about it, and I didnt bring it up. What a shitty email. Maybe this is her way of making herself feel better...closure. Whatever the reason, it was a ridiculously immature email. On behalf of the Clark family, I apologize. I need to learn how to change a diaper. Slappy's a pappy!

 I agree with Karissa. It's been one helluva day. Nothing like starting off your day by telling Jenny Devlin/Petro to go fuck herself. Sometimes we have an animal get into our basement sometimes. I can hear it squeaking and it sounds like it's the walls. Bob doesn't believe me but we let oscar downstairs anway. Oh shit. The rain just started here.

 Okay, kiddies. We started this dangerously dark Tuesday with a Dead Mouse Morning. All night, I heard the singing of a cricket in my house, and all I could think was, 'I hope the kittens kill it before it jumps on me.' This morning I realized that it wasn't a cricket that was echoing in my dreams, but a little mousey voice calling for help as it was terrorized by my vicious beasties. So, I buried this one out in front of the Faery Tree, the dead tree remains that are outside my door. The soil as nice and soft, having until recently been part of a tree. Now, the sky is growing dark, thunder is rolling slowly over the building, and, in the words of Dagmar in "Joe Versus the Volcano," we seem to be "in for a blow..." Does it seem ironic to anyone else that I'm going to spend the afternoon going over finances with my Dad and mortgage broker? Just one potential disaster at a time...:)

 I have a really terrible cough that has made my throat all hoarse. I sound like Marge Schott. It's fun. It's almost like sexy phlegm.

 Now just throw your hands in the air and wave them like you just dont care. Somebody. Anybody. Everybody. Scream. Woo. I'm a party person. I like to party and have a good time. I bet you can tell that about me. Sometimes I like to dance and other times I like to just wave my hands in the air like I just dont care. And really, I dont. I just wave them. Back and forth. Yelling "woo" when the moment is right.

 The weekend with Nina and Dylan was an adventure. We went to the zoo on Saturday and then tried to go for a walk around Lake Griffy yesterday. I'm really glad Danielle went with us to the zoo. Then I had someone to walk and talk with while Nina was hunting her son. He punched Lulu I the chest on Saturday night. Apparently I'm really scary when pissed off. I grabbed his shirt and pulled him back so quickly he ended up on his butt. Then I got in his face and yelled at him for hitting her. He cried, but Nina didn't coddle him. She told him he needed to apologize to me and the cat for hitting her. I helped him pet Lulu gently to try to make up a little bit, but he never did apologize to me. He chased the cats around, and that's fine, but you lay one hand on any of them in violence and my mother instinct comes out. I would have beaten his butt right then (I did swat him one), but thinking about it now, that kind of undermines the whole "we don't hit" thing. Too bad logic and anger don't mix. My Dad is going to come down tomorrow to see the condo and talk with Lisa, my mortgage broker. We're all going to sit down and see how much money Dad is really going to need to throw at me. I hate borrowing from him, but if I don't, I'll never get a place of my own. Why do I keep forgetting to get lottery tickets? Yeah, like I'm going to win at that, too. *sigh* Whoever invented money deserves a boot to the head.

 So- we looked at 3 houses on Sunday and the one I posted about on Friday. We LOVE that house. Not just a little- like, freaking out, love the house. We drove around the area and were very happy with what we saw. Neighbors in their yards chatting- Marshall waved at them- they smiled and waved back (even with the "I'm not sure I know you but I'll wave anyway" look). The house IS old. Very old- but the condition it is in is very nice. We could do so much with it. The nice part is that it is in a more-than-livable condition at present, so any projects we want to do could be done while living there. We had a boatload of questions about it to forward through our realtor- but she's checking on those and we are going to go look at it again on Wednesday. She's also getting us a number where we can check on crime-rates for the area and stuff, though I felt very comfortable there. We aren't rushing into anything- but if all of our questions are answered and we get a positive answer about breaking our lease (when and if it comes to that)- then we will make an offer. The lady who owns it is elderly and now lives with family- has the mortgage paid off and has for some time. She's even offering assistance with closing costs and down payment. But anyway- the house is huge- we wouldn't even have furniture to put upstairs other than our desks and computers yet. It's WAY better than the pictures make it look- they don't do it any justice. I'm actually surprised that it's still on the market. But there's always a reason, and we'll try to uncover that. Oh, and I was wrong- there is nothing wrong with the siding- the outside of the house is just fine- the picture was just distorted and dark. It's actually quite charming. We had an excellent weekend too- no particular reason- it was just really nice. Good Quality time- that's what I'm talking about. OH, but don't ever rent "Dickie Roberts" - it's a David Spade movie about child tv stars. Maybe it was just my mood- but I didn't make it through more than 1/2 an hour.

 Cara have a fantastic time- give Steph a hug for me (we miss you Steph). Chris- what you said made perfect sense- thank you. I am going to do a lot of research this week and see what happens- I still can't make a move until Marsh finds out if they are striking or not at SBC, but at least I will be prepared after. Ok- I just hate my job- I don't want to be here today. I feel like it's an insult to my intelligence now. I would rather be just about ANYWHERE than here. I'd rather be back at Sprint. REALLY. At least there, I had fun. I worked my ASS off, but I had fun. I was respected and paid fairly. And was up for promotion/raise there- and would have got it too. Ah, live and learn- but why did I leave that job?

 Just wanted to remind you guys that I'm going to be gone until Thursday. If you don't hear from me, it's because I'm in warmer weather, drinking hurricanes and visiting Steph! Can I just tell you that I think the Yeah, yeah, yeahs rock?!

 cool. it was weird. i kept calling that number, but some other woman answered the first time. then the second time i got a voicemail with a guy's voice, then the guy answered. i don't know if it was my phone or what, but i couldn't get it to go through to the right phone.

 Hey Steph. My phone number is still the same (812) 552-1811. I'll give you a call later. I am at Emily's right now we went and painted pottery like we all did before you left for New Orleans!

 help! i keep calling jen's number that is on my caller i.d.. she just called me on sunday when i was at the strawberry festival, and i called her back 2 days ago. i left a voicemail- so i know it's her number. and then she called me back yesterday and left me one, now i'm calling that number again, but some other man and woman keep answering the phone. it's weird. did her number change since last night? if you see or talk to her please tell her to call me since my calls aren't getting through tonight. thanks guys. (i just can't figure it out)

 Em, you can actually buy your home with no money down. They can set up two loans - the first for 80% of the value of the home and the second (a home equity loan) for the remaining 20%. It's a piggyback mortgage and lots of people in Chicago do it because no one can afford to put 20% down. If you do a 80-15-5 (the rates are better for this), then you take out a loan for 80% (mortgage), then 15% (home equity), then put down 5% (your money). This way, you avoid paying mortgage insurance, which they require if you dont put down 20%...that aint tax deductible and is just a waste of your money. We went with the 80-15-5 for a $321,500 home. So, we put down $16,000, financed 80%/$257,200 with a 5-year ARM at 4.75% and then took out a home equity loan for $48,225 at a rate of 5.1%. Our total monthly payments are $1,400. You can also do a straight 80/20 and all you pay are the closing costs, or have them financed in to the loan. Dunno if this makes any sense!

 em- i hope you go for the other job. it sounds a million times better. drinks 2 times a month doesn't sound bad! :)

 Steph- Actually- my review was glowing. But I was told that he didnt' FEEL I was ready for the promotion yet. WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT? There were only 3 improvement points and all were not something that would hold me back from that. it's ok though because I got an excellent lead for an ad agency job that serves DRINKS - alcoholic DRINKS to the employees every other friday via a drink cart. Um, sign me up. I'd leave this in a heartbeat- plus it's downtown. I'd leave this for that if it paid the SAME amount. I can't make less- but that's ok. I'll post more details about the asshole review thing later- I have some stuff to do-

 em- does that mean they didn't give you a good review? that sucks. i haven't seen you at work there, but i know you work really hard. about the house. see if indianapolis has any kind of bond assistance. also look into the energy company and see if they have any kind of deals with assistance. Entergy down here gives $1000 to people who need down payment assistance. if there are any places that have homebuyer's training courses contact them to see if they have something. you may have to take 12 hours of training, but for what they give you it is more than worth it. it sounds like karissa's mortgage broker was very helpful, but if you can get help from places like what i mentioned you won't have to pay a penny for services. only a nominal fee for taking the class. i payed $20. that's it.

 I fucking hate my job.

 Em, go to http://www.in.gov/ihfa/. That site will give you the specifics you're looking for. Or, even better, you can call my mortgage broker and she can help you find the loan program that's best for you. Her office in in Greenwood, and unlike a lot of mortgage brokerage places, she doesn't work on commission so when she looks at rates and stuff like that, she's really trying to find the best plan for you, not the one that's going to line her pockets the most. Lisa has been so great for me throught this whole thing. She's super friendly, she's a hard worker, and if she doesn't know something she checks with people who do and gets back to you really fast. She's really good about keeping me posted as things progress. She's also one of the few people who has ever been able to explain finances to me in a way that I can actually understand what's going on. And you know how I am with money. Her contact info: Lisa Steckler First Horizon Home Loans 1-800-778-7838 I can't remember her extension, but if you just give them her name they'll connect you. Seriously, it's totally worth the money (don't ask me how much her services are because I don't know; I just write checks when they tell me to).

 Hey all you homeowners- or aspiring homeowners. I want to find out about the down-payment grants that are available- do any of you have that info? I don't know if it's state specific or a federal program- but it would be a great help for us. Anyway- CWA (Marshall's union) gave SBC 30 day notice of strike. If their new contract is not resolved in 30 days- they can call a strike at any moment. Now, on the good side- in the 27 years that one of his coworkers has been there, they've only actually stiked twice. I just hope this isn't the third. As soon as a new contract is signed- we intend to make an offer on the house. Oh- and at 10am this morning (CST) please keep me in your thoughts. I have a performance review and REALLY need my promotion and raise.

 thanks em. karissa- 1508 clearview pkwy, apt a, metairie la 70001 (hopefully it will change very soon!). to an extent i feel sorry for damien's girlfriend. she's not really too interesting. she doesn't like doing anything, she's picky as hell when it comes to food (she never tried seafood before coming down here and she's 21!), she doesn't really like music, and she doesn't like certain actors who are really good because they have long hair. i just didn't have anything in common with her i guess. she's nice though. i think damien is taking advantage of her and he knows it. oh well, enough about him. he's fun when he's in a good mood. em- i hope you still have a chance to get that house. cara-anything interesting at work? :)

 Ok- Jen's current address for anyone wondering: 4903 Red Horizon Blvd Indy, IN 46221

 Em, can you post that here, please? I'd like to get it in my address book as well. And Steph, do I have your address? I'm so confused. I kind of feel like I'm having post-Tuesday-Traumatic Stress Syndrome... I have no news. Well, except that I left my brace at home today. How long are you supposed to wear those things? It was supporting my ankle but it was making my calf muscle cramp up from being held in one position for so long. Yesterday my toes kept falling asleep and I know I didn't have it wrapped too tightly because I kept loosening it until the silly straps started popping off when I'd flex my foot. It's nice not to have it on today. We'll see how it goes. Steph, at least your houseguest will be leaving. At least you don't have to spend the rest of your life with him. Don't you feel sorry for his girlfriend? Or anyone else who has to live with him for the rest of his life? It sounds like he needs a keeper, and I have a feeling no one will be applying for that position any time soon. I'm guessing with his "financial savy" the pay would be crappy and the benefits unimpressive...

 ok, thanks.

 Hey Steph- it has changed- but I'm not sure what it is at the moment. It's her mom's new address in Indy- if I get a chance to call her later, I'll see what it is...TTYL

 is jen's address still 130 pinedale ct, whiteland? or has it changed since then. i can never keep updated with phone numbers and addresses!

 karissa- your absolutely right about the toilet paper issue. he did grow up with that problem and his parents taught him that. adam had to deal with that too growing up in the same small town as this guy. HOWEVER, we live in the city in an apartment and the issue has come up. last august we told him he didn't have to do that. but the bigger problem is HOW MUCH toilet paper he uses. really, it's an unbelievable amount. i have to buy more toilet than i ever imagined. and it's also paper towels. if he gets paper towelS while eating, he gets twice as much as he needs and wastes half of it. i'm not exaggerating his habits. it's ridiculous. he is going to pay us the $200 back when his tax return gets here, so i'm not worried about that at all. so many people owe us money and i know he's the one person who will pay us back. i just hope he throws a little extra on top of it since he hasn't paid for any groceries in a really long time. he waited until he was flat ass broke before getting a job. and what's really stupid is that he started a job sunday, but is leaving in a month. it makes no sense. well, it does really because like i said, he wants to be miserable so the return home is better. stupid stupid stupid little boy.

 Even as your boss's assistant, A should not be allowed access to his email in anything beyond a professional capacity, i.e. if a business contact calls for product or service information. If he receives person email from any other employee, legally A has no right to look at it. The problem is, he's given her permission. People need to know that their email is being read by someone other than their boss. It's like recording a conversation without the other person's knowledge. In companies where email is monitored, the employees are told before they even begin working that their emails are subject to review by the administration. If they are not told about this first and find out later, they can sue. That company company is a law suit waiting to happen. If your boss is not aware of privacy laws, he needs to be informed. Here, when we become supervisors we all have to go through legal compliance training so if something happens the University can say that they told us our responisbilities so any law suit goes to the individual instead of the institution. Sucky for us, good for the university. Steph, the best way to get rid of someone like you houseguest is to tell them they have to pay rent. Brian had to do that with one of the bad roommates they've picked up in the past and it worked like a dream. And maybe lending him the $200 will be worth it if you never have to see him again. Isn't there some old story about how if lending someone money means they won't bother you again, it's money well spent? And if he can't take care of himself, he needs to go back home and live with his mom, who apparently never really taught him how to wipe his ass. Now, the throwing the toilet paper in the trash actually does make a little sense. When I was looking at house-houses, a lot of them out in the country have septic tanks, and apparently the only thing that's supposed to go in the septic tank is waste, not paper. Gross, yes, but maybe he was brought up in a place that had a really crappy septic tank (no pun intended) and to make it last as long as possible his parents made them all throw away their toilet paper instead of flush it. And I must say that this revelation on plumbing technology did indeed convince me that living in the city, or at least close enough to be on city water ans sewage, seem like the best possible plan.

 Wow- now that sounds like complex algebra. If B=Boss, then AB>K. However if B likes A & K equally- then he needs to treat them fairly. Honestly- all algebra jokes aside- this has lawsuit written all over it. A civil lawsuit against A and a seperate one against B and then one against the company. K, and any other employee who's personal info is NOT only being seen by the boss (and or possibly deleted before he can see it) is a privacy violation. There's probably something written in a company handbook about open communication with your boss- that would implicate them, right there. My advice? Run, not walk, to the gentle arms of a new job. Do ANYTHING you have to to get a new job. Take a day without pay to have interviews or whatever. You are only asking for more anxiety by keeping yourself in this situation. You shouldn't have to be stuck in the middle knowing that A knows what K wants to talk to the boss about or even the boss touching you thing...that's WRONG...don't let it happen, and if he won't stop- put it in writing. If he won't stop after that, quit and seek a lawyer. I hate my job- but I definitely don't have to deal with those issues- if I did, I would definitely get out of there extra fast... Best of luck chica.

 that's a tough one cara. i don't know what i'd do, especially if i liked both people. it's unprofessional and plain wrong what A does, but i understand not wanting trouble at work-when the job already isn't fun. i would probably just give advice to anyone telling me they need to go to the boss- go tell him face to face, DON'T email. jen- i will call you back. our fucking "roommate" damien was on the phone all goddamn day yesterday. what a jerk. he's staying rent free because adam was nice enough to offer a place for him to stay. he just pays for food (not even all the time) and car/entertainment stuff. he has turned out to be a big moocher/loser/immature/user and we've both had it. he'll be gone in a month, but he's making us miserable. GET THIS: the jerkoff was talking on the phone to one of his friends in flagstaff (adam was camping for a couple of nights so i was there by myself with him). he tells his friend, blatanly loud enough for me to hear, that he does NOT want to have a good time while he's here because he is afraid he won't want to go back (he has a girlfriend blah blah blah)!!!! how stupid is that. so instead of thinking how that makes his friend (aka adam) feel he is a selfish prick who doesn't care. what i don't get is how this asshole can not feel guilty about what he's doing. we even let him borrow $200 while his girlfriend was here on her spring break! he is totally selfish and disrespectful. he has not once offered to take out the trash (he's been here since january), only does minimal dishes SOMETIMES, and uses more toilet paper than anyone i have ever seen in my entire life. really, he throws most of it in the trash can (yes-even after shitting) and when he does try to flush it the toilet gets clogged because he uses about a pound of it at a time. AND HE DOESN'T EVEN USE THE PLUNGER HIMSELF! he leaves it there until adam does it for him.AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! thanks for letting me rant. there's a lot more too. he *thinks* he's a sex addict (what guy doesn't like sex!!??) so he likes to jerk off to internet porn when adam and i are in our room. if he doesn't think we know then he's stupid. i walked downstairs one time to find him sitting there with all the lights off, underwear still on thank god, but pants down around his ankles. i didn't say a goddamn word- went straight to the refrigerator and got something to drink, went upstairs, and continued my awesome video game with adam. when i told adam he just laughed- i did too though when i saw him. BUT the funniest part about him thinking he's a sex addict- when his current girlfriend asked him what he liked (because he had been bragging about being "nasty") he replied, "oh, i like to be on top" (as in missionary-not doggie style or anything)!!!!!!!! she told that story while we were eating and i laughed harder than any other time since he's been here. for such a "nasty" guy i think that's the most common way to have sex. to give him a little bit of credit- he's graduating college this year and is depressed and lost (like a lot of us are during that period). but he is still a big baby who can't take care of himself and adam and i refuse to do it. i really should get back to work. k-glad your ankle is better.

 Here's my problem, besides the fact that my boss likes to lean up against me now for no apparent reason: We've had drama here at work lately and to make a long story short, one of my co-workers (K) emailed a complaint to my boss about another co-worker (A). She asked if she could have a meeting with him to discuss it. When we were in a sales meeting, K referred to the email and my boss said he never got it, much to K's surprise. I happened to find out that A reads all of my bosses emails and I think she deleted it. She told me she reads them and not to tell anyone. He knows and gives her permssion to do it. (She's kind of like his assistant). I know this will cause huge problems with everyone because they think he is the only one reading his emails. I know that a lot of people have written him with personal and professional problems which she reads. What should I do? Should I warn everyone and cause a huge scene for their own protection or should I keep my mouth shut? I like both K and A.

 Em, I'm glad you finally got to talk to your Dad. I knew he wouldn't have just not called on purpose, but if you don't know what's going on, it just makes things worse. Cara, I want to know, too! Email me, too! I'm on the computer all morning today, so entertain me! :) The ankle is good today. I thought about not wearing my brace but it started to hurt in the shower so I put the damn thing on anyway. Still, it feels like it's nearly healed, so I'm not going to worry too much. I'm going to the pool with Abby tonight, so that should help. Why is it already such a Tuesday?

 Cara- email it from your aol to me here at work. My dad did finally call last night- turns out there was a roofing conference in town, so he had TONS of associates in town and the date just completely slipped his mind. He felt horrible- and so did my stepmom and sister. I felt better after talking to them- but I was hurt. However, I think my present will be better because of it :) I can't wake up today- coffee isn't even kicking in- and I don't drink a lot of coffee so that when I do, it works. Oh, and I have my performance review on Thursday. I'm trying REALLY hard not to screw anything up so that I can get my promotion and raise. And I fucking messed up! My goddamned display for conventions came in yesterday- which is good. I approved it all and it was printed ahead of schedule WITH A TYPO THAT I DID! fuck. My only reprieve is that it can "probably" be reprinted in time....but we still don't know. wish me luck.

 Em...I can't believe your dad didn't call you. That's really surprising. Maybe you should call him to see what's up. I'm glad you liked the candles. It's really hard to find things at Pier 1 from your registery because nothing is really labeled. The ladies at the store couldn't even find things. Maybe Valpo Pier 1 employees are idiots. I completely understand how you feel about not knowing any of your "friends" at your own birthday party. It will get better in time. Sorry to hear about the delay on the house. I know you guys were really excited about it. Karissa...a dog washer? You should time how quickly it takes you to get completely soaked! It might be kinda fun though since you love animals. Chris...You never answered how much daycare is in Chicago. I wanna know. I wanna redo my answer and say $1300. Nothing new here. Counting down the days until vacation. I have a moral work delima (another one!) that I need advice on but I'll have to email it from home. So look for that soon.

 My ankle is really great today, actually. I'm almost able to not limp, which is really cool, and it really doesn't hurt. I can't wait to get home and unwrap it and see how much the swelling has gone down. I went to Petsmart and put in an application to be a dog washer, and the manager kept saying that it's really hard work and he wouldn't want to do it, and I just kept nodding, thinking, yeah, you have no idea how crazy one would have to be to do a job like that, and he has no idea how much crazy I can bring in with me. I know it would be hard work, but it's an experience I want to have, so there. It's got to be better than being a jailer...

 Ok- updates after the birthday weekend: First- Cara- thanks very much for the candles- I loved them and Marshall reaps the benefits :) Second- my FATHER forgot my freaking birthday. I STILL have not heard from him. No card, no call, NOTHING. I don't necessarily want a gift...fine- whatever...but a CALL or a CARD is not too much to ask. And I know I'm not on his shit list- I haven't done anything. I'm biting my tongue, but it's hard not to get REALLY mad about this after all the years he's given me shit about not calling every week or something. Third- the house- Well, we were all set to make an offer on the house this week. I was going to call my realtor this morning to set up a time/place to do so. Then Marshall found out that it is LIKELY that his union at SBC will strike at the end of May unless they are able to come to agreement and sign a new contract (they have been without one for several months now). So, we cannot make an offer on the house until we KNOW that we'll have the income on a continuous basis- because it would be my luck to make an offer, have it accepted, get a mortgage and then he loses his job...uh uh- I'm not going to add to the numbers that make Indiana the highest state for foreclosure. So at the risk of losing the house we love, we are not making an offer right now. I've alerted my realtor to what is going on- and told her that if things correct themselves, we have full intention on making an offer on the house. However, the seller is motivated- and we'll probably miss out...but we'll see- I'll keep you all posted. Other than that, I had a great weekend. Wish you all could have been there, it was awkward being out with a group of people that I'm less than familiar with. Talk to you soon!

 testing 1, 2, 3...tap, tap.... HELLO WISCONSIN! Ok, I think I'm working again... Karissa...hope you are feeling better soon!

 Em, Happy Belated Birthday! I meant to call you yesterday, but I had a bit of a strange weekend and just lost track of time and space. But I do have a good excuse, and the doctors at Prompt Care can vouch for me. On Saturday, I was going to go to a matinee with Aja and Danielle and maybe Polly (she's not the easiest person to get ahold of because she never has her cell on and she tends not to be home when I call). Well, Aja didn't get home from work when expected, so I decided to go do laundry. I had 5 loads to do, so the laundry mat was the place to go. But before I could go to the south side, I had to fill up my gas tank. Turns out my credit card was maxed, so I had to write a check. I stopped to get cash and transfered some money to cover the check. At the laundry mat, I put all 5 loads in, having to buy one box of detergent because I ran out of liquid on load 4, and then, when they were all finished washing, I realized that I had forgotten to start the 5th load. This left me with two options: either wash the last load while the others dried or wait until that was finished and then dry them all together. I decided to wait on the drying because if I didn't, I'd have to wait another half hour for the last load to dry, which, now that I think about it, I guess it wouldn't have added any more time than waiting to dry did. Ah, well, it worked out all the same. So after drying, I folded everything, piled it into the basket and started carrying it out to the car, which I had parked right outside the door, all of maybe 10 feet away. Half way across the sidewalk, something in the basket shifted and a set of sheets fell off on the sidewalk. I stopped, set everything down, and brushed a lot of gravel and dirt off of the newly-cleaned sheet. By this time I'm realizing that this is just one of those days, so I kind of laugh it off and get in the car and drive home. Once there, I got to pet one of the neighborhood dogs. His owner was taking him out for a walk and I suddenly realized this was the same dog I met two years ago when she first brought him home as a puppy. He was so sweet and excited, I rubbed his belly and got puppy kisses and fended him off when he tried to jomp on me. I always forget how much dogs like people, especially ones who like to rub their bellies. After a few minutes, she took him home and I went back to my car and grabbed wet laundry (the stuff I don't dry) and my purse. Happily, I walked down the sidewalk, keys in hand, thinking about how nice the dog and his owner were, and then it happened. I missed the last step. Well, not really though. Had I missed it, I would have been alright. My shoe may have gotten muddy in the grass, but I would have been fine. For those of you who have been to my place, you may recall the little half-step between the last real step and my patio? It's like a stepping-stone that's been cut in half and placed there so the last step isn't quite so far down. It has never made sense to me, but it's never bitten me before, either. It's not as wide as the step itself is, and is about 2 inches tall. The inside part of my right foot caught it and my ankle turned down, and I'm pretty sure it hit the sidewalk before my foot did. I pitched forward, caught myself on all fours and tried to breath through the pain of my left knee. I stayed there for a minute and finally started crying and trying to figure out how to get up off the ground. Both legs hurt so shifting to one side and pushing up wasn't really working for me, but since that was the only option, I managed it. I don't really know how; you know how quickly I go from normal to shocky, but I did get into the house and managed to strip off my pants before my knee bled through. I was just glad I didn't rip my pants. I was wearing my good khakis because it was laundry day and I wanted to wash all of my jeans. Well, I hobbled in, got myself cleaned up, and realized that going up to get my clothes basket wasn't really an option. I could barely hobble around the house; carrying a heavy basket of clean laundry, some of which I'd already picked up off the ground once already, didn't seem like the best idea to me. So, I sat in my chair, put my foot up and called Aja and Danielle. I needed a really big bandaid for my knee and didn't have any in the house. I though I might have had one or two left over from when I hurt my finger and the doctor threw an assortment of shapes and sizes at me, but alas, no. But they had some big ones around the house and brought them over to me. We watched a couple of cheesy movies, ordered pizza (shocking, I know; me, eating pizza! no!) and just hung out. I would stretch my ankle occasionally to make sure it wasn't tightening up too much and when I went to bed everything seemed to be ok. Well, aside from the pain, but what are you going to do about that? Every time I rolled over in the night, the weight of the blankets on my ankle was so great that I woke up screaming in pain. It was about 6 in the morning when I decided a trip to Prompt Care might be a good idea. I slept a little later, but finally just gave up and got up and had breakfast. I couldn't get ahold of Abby and I didn't get ahold of Sarah until about 12:30, when I called and woke her up. She got to my house around two and we took my car. Prompt Care is the place to be on a Sunday, let me tell you. The waiting room was packed. We had to sit in the hall for a little while until two chairs together cleared out. I'm limping, of course, but I would like to say here that once Sarah saw my ankle, she agreed that I wasn't exaggerating. In the night, it had swollen to the size of a golf ball, so it's no wonder it hurt like the devil. Well, we haven't had a chance to gossip for a long time, so we caught up and that was good. The nurse man who took us back to the room was joking with us. I'm pretty sure he thought we were together, but that just made it funnier. He was very nice, and I appreciate it when people are willing to joke with you. He offered me a wheelchair, but I told him I could walk. He asked me if Sarah had been beating me and I told him no, I'd walked into a wall...;) He left us in the exam room and the doctor came in and had me take the shoe and sock off my good foot so he could compare. Can I say that my right ankle was at least 3 times the size of my left? Sarah can vouch for that. Well, we did x-rays and found out it isn't broken, which I figured since I could walk on it, and then the nurse man came back in and wrapped it and put the brace on it. I was wearing a flip-flop on that foot yesterday, so I got to show off my stylish new brace everywhere we went. After Prompt Care, we went to the west side so I could put in a couple of job applications. I put one in at Bed Bath and Beyond and I found out that Petsmart doesn't do applications. They have open interviews every Monday, so I'm going to go over around 3 for that. Yes, I'm wearing jeans, but I also have on my nice black buttondown, so I'm dress cas, and that's as good as it's getting today. I found my old tan tennis shoes, which look pretty good, and managed to put the right one on over my foot and brace. But, because the universe has a perverse sense of humor, and I have actually been laughing along this time, I have one more injury to add to the list. This morning, Ada used my face as a launch pad and scratched my nose bad enough to break the skin and make it bleed. So, I have a gimpy foot, a two-bandaid knee and a big old bloody nose. Can I be any more attractive? And yes, I really do think this is pretty funny. Just last week I thought to myself, wow, it's been a really long time since I've hurt myself. That's why you should knock on wood, even if you only think it. Apparently, the faeries can hear your thoughts and use them to teach you humility and humor. I may be limping today, but it doesn't really hurt anymore, now that I have the brace for support, so no worries. Just clutzy. And good at it. :)

 Steph...I'll definitely give you a call. I'm having major problemswiththebloggerormy computer.everytimeihitthespacebar,itfreaksout.anyone elsehavingthatproblem?

 cara, just let me know when you get into town and when you'd like to go out to eat or whatever. of course i'd love to see you and hang out! 504-885-2658 :) i better get to bed, i hate getting up early.

 Sorry about the double post.

 Em...That sucks. I think it was written in our lease that we couldn't sublet. $7,800 is a lot of money. That was even more than our down payment, I think. Luckily, it's friday and you can get wasted without getting up early the next morning for work. Chris...we did try gumbo. Didn't like it too much. Never saw any etoufee but we did have beneigts (misspelled) which were REALLY good. The best thing we saw were 8 gay men without shirts and matching paisley skirts. Steph...There was a piano player at Jean Lefittes. We also saw this awesome blues singer at Storyville. I wish I could have seen the house you want. At least I was on your street. That whole area is awesome. Bob says that he would rather live in New Orleans than Chicago! The only thing would be the summer and the heat. He believes that it snows there in the winter time. Is that true? Never heard you mention it before. Bob went out to buy another pack of gum.

 Cara, glad you had a great vacation...you needed it! Did you eat gumbo or etouffee? MMmmm. Em, sorry about your crappy situation (both work and lease). Will they not let you get a subleter? I mean, they'll get their money on a monthly basis regardless of whether or not it's you or a subleter. By law, the landlord is supposed to not only let you sublet, but also help you FIND someone and show it for you. I have an attorney friend that might be able to look over your lease if you'd like. We saw the baby's heartbeat today. Amazing. The little heart was going a mile a minute.

 *Barbaric Yawp* Ok....can I catch a break here please? So, on the same day that I find out that maybe someone else will make an offer on the house we love, I find out how impossible it is to break our lease. We have a few options: Shitty option #1- pay for the entire lease (a tune of about $7800+) PLUS pay back the "special" that we took when we moved in and move out immediately with no strings. Shitty option #2- pay for the remainder of the lease (about $7800) and hope that they can re-rent it. If they re-rent it, we get reimbursed for the rest- i.e.- if we left in May- and paid the $7800- and then they re-rented in July- we'd get back about $5850. So- good in the long run, but where exactly do we come up with $7800 to start with? Shitty option #3- forget all about the house and stick it out until the end of the lease and give our horrible 60 DAY notice in October and hope we find a house to close on by then. I need an alcoholic beverage. In fact, several.

 cara, i'm glad you had a good time! i wished i could have seen you more too, i felt the same way when i dropped you guys off. it was so quick even though we talked for about 2 hours. jean lafitte's really is one of the coolest bars i've been to. was someone playing at the piano when you went? em- tell me about the house stress. we drove by the one we will eventually look at last night. there were garbage bags outside so at least the tenants moved out and they are cleaning so hopefully next week...! i hope it works out for you too and the house you really want. you know, when we looked at some houses the seller's realtor was there and they would ALWAYS tell our realtor "someone/people already put an offer in, so tell them to make a decision quick". which we were told that they always do that to pressure buyers into making quick decisions to make offers. don't sweat it so much because chances are you do have time.

 I'm back! We had a great time in Memphis, New Orleans and Nashville. It's funny that we were able to stay at two hotels with guitar shaped swimming pools. It was kinda chilly but we didn't care because we were on vacation and we were not at work. I didn't get drunk but Bob got tipsy quite a few times. Happy Hour in New Orleans is crazy with 3 for 1 drink specials. You either got 3 beers for the price of one or one mixed drink with 3 shots in it. I had one captain and coke and I thought I was going to puke. My mouth felt like it was on fire. Steph, we went to Jean LeFittes, like you suggested and that place was really cool. It was dark as hell but it wasn't as loud as some of those places. I'll never figure out why they give the biggest assholes microphones to yell at customers. I wish we could have seen each other more. When you left, I immediately felt sad. Emily, I know buying a house is stressful. I'll keep my fingers crossed for you. Karissa, I hate mice but I don't know if I would be able to kill it myself. I would want it dead though. You are a better person than I. Chris, Try living with a man who just gave up smoking!

 So, I heard from my realtor today. There is someone else seriously interested in the house we love. They haven't made an offer yet, but they may. My realtor told the sellers realtor to let her know if an offer comes through. It's Crunch time- Marshall's union votes next week on whether to strike or not. If they do not vote to strike, we are making an offer the next day. We want to make an offer anyway- but we just can't. Shit is seriously stressing me out. I need a new job in a VERY bad way. I regret ever leaving Sprint. I really do. I was working really hard, and had some issues- but I ran away too fast- and I realize that now. Hind sight really is 20/20. I did put my resume in for a few jobs I saw online, we'll see what happens.... TGIF in the worst of ways!

 This morning, I am a god! That's right. A god. Not THE god, mind you, but definitely one of the smaller ones. At least to the mousey world. This morning, I saved a mouse from the pawings of my kittens and released it back into the wild. Why? Because I rock! Now I want a reward. Why? Dude, seriously, where have you been the last few minutes? Because I'm a god! I'm a god that rocks! And wears a shiney gold crown. Abby made it for me. I love working in a place where we can outfit each other in binders board and gold foil. :) The cool thing is that I found out I'm not afraid of mice, even when they run at me. I just scooped the little guy into a Pizza Express cup and let him go outside. Sure, he'll come back, and with any luck I'll be able to save him again, but at least this morning, I live in a house of life, not a house of death...:) The only thing I feel bad about is that I didn't get up at 3 to save him, when the cats started chasing him. I should have gotten up and saved him then, but I was asleep and pretended I wasn't listening to them hunt him down. I was all prepared to clean up another mousey corpse, but this one was much too wiley and dedicated to life to be kill-bitten before I came to his rescue. Next time, I'll get up and be a truely good person, saving the rodent from the paws of death, even at the cost lost sleep.

 chris- cara didn't seem to thrilled with the idea of getting hurricanes when i mentioned it to her. i don't know why though, cause they are gooooood, tastes like koolaid. :) if i ever got pregnant i honestly don't know how i'd be. i'm not a moody person to begin with. and i keep thinking that i wouldn't have too bad of mood swings as long as people around me aren't being stupid. i would be more of a pest about always wanting to eat i think. plus, when i am in a bad mood i usually don't say much so i can't picture myself acting crazy all of a sudden. cara and bob are probably on their way home now.

 I would be a pediatric nurse, but I have enough trouble cleaning up cat vomit without losing my lunch. Poop, pee, blood I can handle for the most part, but puke gets me every time. And I can't even watch the surgery channel. Still, I'll keep it in mind when I start looking for a second career. As for the pregnancy hormones, yeah, that's going to suck big time for whomever is around. I'm moody enough as it is. I bet I'd have to go off my anti-depressants, too, so that would suck. Has she started dropping things and forgetting things? Placenta brain really sucks. It gave me something to tease my sister about. :) Just wait until the second trimester kicks in, though. Things should level out, or at least that's what I'm told. Any sympathy pains or cravings yet?

 Chris- I pity Marshall when I finally get pregnant. My hormones and mood swings are bad enough minus pregnancy. Oh, we're in for a wild ride I'm sure. Wow- I just realized that she'll be almost due at my wedding. There is only 5 1/2 months until the wedding....How cool- a cute little prego Liz at the wedding- yeah!!!

 Were the Cunninghams blitzed on Hurricanes? Everyone has a twin. Karissa, as I walked into the hospital today I saw a nurse that I swear I thought was you. It was just surreal. I walked really quickly - stalker like - and stared at her with my left eye. Obviously, it wasnt you. Then I got to thinking, "By God, K would be a PERFECT pediatric nurse." Well, unless you're squemish and such. CMH will pay for the majority of nursing school and give you fat bonus, should you be so inclined : ) The female body is a miracle. Female hormones are a nightmare. 6 1/2 months to go.

 Nothing exciting going on here, either. I forgot about my ankle last night in the pool and gave a mighty kick in the first move of the cardio section and was painfully reminded. That is the kind of clever girl I am. What can I say? It's a gift. ;) I also just realized this morning that my supervisor is kind of a victim. He's not your typical mopey victim, though. He's a boisterous, kind of obnoxious, conspiracy theory kind of victim. Everyone is out to get his money. Everyone but the tobacco industry. Hm. Well, no, I guess they are, too, which is why he's a smoker. Don't get me wrong. I really like Garry and I'm really glad he's on our side, but sometimes I just want to yell at him and tell him that this is the way things are, whether he likes it or not, this is how the world works. Yeah, it sucks that you have to pay people for the services they provide, and sometimes they do a crappy job and charge you anyway, but that's just how it is. It doesn't have to be fair. You just have to accept it and move on. I made the mistake of asking him if he finished his taxes this morning. Will I never learn? Ah, well. Other than that, nothing new here.

 hey, dinner was good. we sat there and talked for a couple of hours. i wish they could have stayed longer, through the weekend so i could have taken them to a couple of places. now the weather is getting nicer and they're leaving. it happened to get cold and crappy as soon as they got here. i hope they had a good time though. talked to jen last night which was nice. i knew she would like being a mom. i wish i could see emily grace. cara brought pictures of the baby shower and that was the first time i had seen jen pregnant. she looks really cute. :) i hope your week gets better em! we're still waiting on a phone call from that lady to go look at her house. i REALLY hope we like it. i better get back to work. talk to you all later.

 I wish. We still don't know about Marshall's impending strike- so nothing moving with the house yet. I still have my same sucky job with nothing on the immediate horizon. I was just stuck on a phone call for 50 minutes. I have a dentist appointment this week. I'm broke. That sums up the crap in my life. Good stuff= I got a new comforter. yay! How was your dinner with Cara, Steph?

 nothing exciting happening to anyone? ;)

 i miss you guys too! adam and i are going to dinner with cara and bob tonight. there was the most awesome storm here saturday night. it was constant lightening for 2 hours (downpour also), and the lightening was hitting so close. i hadn't seen it that bad down here, even during the hurricanes. it cooled it off so now while cara and bob are here it probably won't get past 75 degrees. which is still very nice weather.

 What the hell is going on in Louisiana, Steph? BATON ROUGE, La. - People who wear low-slung pants that expose skin or "intimate clothing" would face a fine of up to $500 and possible jail time under a bill filed by a Jefferson Parish lawmaker. State Rep. Derrick Shepherd said he filed the bill because he was tired of catching glimpses of boxer shorts and G-strings over the lowered belt lines of young adults. The bill would punish anyone caught wearing low-riding pants with a fine of as much as $500 or as many as six months in jail, or both. "I'm sick of seeing it," said Shepherd, a first-term legislator. "The community's outraged. And if parents can't do their job, if parents can't regulate what their children wear, then there should be a law." The bill would be tacked onto the state's obscenity law, which restricts sexual activity in public places and the sale of sexually explicit items. Joe Cook, head of the American Civil Liberties Union's Louisiana chapter, said the bill probably does not meet the U.S. Supreme Court's standard for the prohibition of obscene behavior under the First Amendment. "What about a woman who is wearing a bathing suit under her garment or she has something like a sarong wrapped around her and it's below her waist," he said. "I can think of a lot of workers, plumbers, who are working and expose their buttocks ..." Information from: The Times-Picayune, http://WWW.TIMESPICAYUNE.COM

 You want to know what I learned today? Sealing wax melts at a much higher temperature than candle wax. At least my finger finally stopped hurting. I have a blister, but it's not that bad. When I got to work, I decided to find out what the actual temperature is, and it's 170 degrees F. Regular candles melt at about 60-75 degrees. So that explains the surprise and the searing pain...:) Steph, give you mom a hug from me, too. I think about your mom and Greg all the time and I hope they are doing well. Oh, and I think the decorating contest is off. Danielle made the best suggestion I've heard so far, and it's so obvious I can't believe I didn't think of it first. Decorate the bedroom in faeries. It's so me! And so painfully obvious! She's turning down the prize, though. I guess she just doesn't have the money to decorate for me...;) But she did tell me about another faery painter, so now I have Brian Froud (www.worldoffroud.com), Amy Brown (www.amybrownart.com) and Stephanie Pui-Mun Law (www.shadowscapes.com). I was pretty familiar with the first two, but Stephanie is amazing as well. I included the links in case you wanted to go look at their work. Pretty stuff! Yea!

 em, good luck with the job search. i'm sure something great will come up. i agree with cara. my parents will be here tomorrow!!! :) i'll tell them you said hi, cara. i'm so excited, i haven't seen them in so long. it's a great time for them to be here. i think adam and i are going to make an offer on this double we saw in mid-city. i'm going to show my parents the house while they're here. it has hardwood floors all the way until back by the laundry and bathroom area. the side we'd live on has vaulted ceilings and a claw bathtub. we would have to buy all appliances, but there are discounted places around here for that. it has a fence around the yard and enough space to park one car right now. there's this little shed like building (i think it used to be a snowball stand or something) in the back that we'd have to tear down and then there'd be enough room for 2 cars. it's about 3 blocks from the extended canal street streetcar line- which means when we sell we will make a profit. it's next to a middle school so kids being around is good (less crime likely to happen). anyway, i'm trying not to get too excited in case we are disappointed, but wish us luck!! karissa, i'm excited about decorating our potential new place also! definitely lots of paint, but i don't know what else. if you guys want to take a look at some pictures of it you can go to latter-blum.com and type in 551875 for the mls.

 Em...It's ok. It's probably your body just telling you that even if you get the raise, you're not going to be happy. Just keep looking and hopefully you will find something.

 sorry- hit the button by accident. My throat swelled up and I couldn't focus. I just shook my head "no"- there wasn't anything else I needed to say. I am SO looking for a new job. Seriously now. Like, I'm going to send resumes and call in favors and whatever...I've decided that my last two jobs- both with Sprint and with Insight, I ran from those jobs because I got "comfortable"- I now regret leaving both of them. So I examined whether I was doing the same here- but the thing is, I NEVER liked this job. This was a bad fit from the beginning. I have to get out now.

 Well- no need to answer....I'm an idiot. I completely froze and had a mini-anxiety attack. At least that's what I think you call it when your throat swells.

 Ok ladies and gent- I emailed this to Cara already- but I would value your opinions as well- let me know what you think- I have the follow-up to my performance review today. Where I take the improvement points I was given and show my "plan of action" to accomplish these. I have three goals with this meeting: 1) actually set the goals to improve 2)Make my boss accountable for his role in this- and make him give me a list of WHAT I need to do or accomplish to be "ready" to be a manager. and, 3) Ask for a raise. I've never asked for a raise before. In my head, I've worded it well- but when I try to spit it out, it will be jumbled for sure- but I "plan" on saying "After having a few weeks to review my performance review, I can understand where I need to focus to improve my work. However, I think I have taken on a great deal of responsibility- with both papers and have done well overall. I can accept that you don't feel that I'm ready to be a manger yet, but I do feel that I deserve a modest increase in my wages as a reward for my hard work in the last nine months. My job performance will only continue to grow and this will help to confirm that I am doing a good job and motivate me to achieve more. I'm working on the numbers I'm going to ask for- but I'm thinking I'll start at a 5% increase- and expect 3%. If he says no altogether, I then up my efforts for looking for a new job. What do you think?

 Sure, Slappy Pappy, I would love to meet your mother and aunt-in-law. I noticed that Blogger offers GMail from Google. I read something really interesting about that email service some where but I can't remember where. The thing about GMail is that it can store a huge volume of email and pictures. BUT it has this system where it scans every email you recieve and picks out key words and sends you junk mail relating to those words. For instance, you all are talking about buying homes, it would find the word "home" in your email and send you information on banks and realtors. It claims that a human does not read through the emails but some people find it an invasion of privacy. Plus, more spam just sucks. There's nothing new with me. Can you tell?

 Cara, you wanna go to dinner with my mother in-law and aunt in-law when they come stay with us for a month? I think they are coming in a few weeks. Should be interesting and I'll need someone to speak english with.

 Barbaric Yawp is from Dead Poets Society. I think it's Longfellow (not sure though). Anyway- it's a very loud, soulful yell.

 Karissa...maybe if you start by picking out your shower curtin, you can go with a paint color from that. Shit, there was a website that I was going to tell you to look at that had tiki stuff but I can't remember it. There might be some funky wall paper out there but it might make your bathroom look small if it's too busy. Steph...When are your parents coming again? Tell them we said hi. My life is boring. I just keep thinking about our yard. It looks a lot better than it did last year. We've lived there for a year officially. My husband smoked two cigarettes yesterday. At least he told me about it, I guess. He could totally lie and get away with it. What's a barbaric yawp?

 Well Karissa- looks like you locked in your mortgage at just the right time with the interest rates about to rise. Damn pending strike. We'd have our freaking house if it weren't for SBC. I wish it were just so easy to pick up and move somewhere- but it isn't. I don't know what the plan will be. We both hate our jobs- but we love Indy- so, what to do? I'm still waiting to hear ANYTHING on the two resumes I put out. I'd be happy to even get rejection letters- just let me know something. Jen and I went to do the paint-the-pottery stuff a few weeks ago- and mine turned out so pretty- but it was bad bisque and broke in half. So now I have to do it all over again. At least I don't have to pay for it- but the timing was terrible. Marshall and I were having a mini-arguement, and then I pick up the broken wedding platter.....nice...real nice. And why are people calling ME asking me if my boss plans on being here today? What the fuck? Thank GOD his wife is almost due- which means he'll spend quite a bit of time out of the office for at least a week, and then probably plan a trip to the UK to visit his family with the new baby....I'm looking at some fairly free time without the boss here soon- THANK YOU.

 Chris, if you can make it down, that's great! If not, that's great, too. I hope you can talk Liz into coming down with you. Not that I'd let a pregnant woman work, but she can hang out with my mom and be in charge of snacks. I intend to be sure people are well-fed. And for the people who are willing to travel, if you don't have a place to stay, you're more than welcome to stay with me. I have the air mattress, which I'll sleep on so married or pregnant people don't have to try to get up off the floor. Hell, that's why I finally got a box spring and bed frame. Getting up in the morning was way too hard. Oh, and tell Liz to eat peppermints. Mint helps settle the stomach. Peppermint tea is nice, too.

 Jen, what do you do when you wanna go to a movie?

 Whoa. I smell Home and Garden Network. We're gonna paint a room the color of a pumpkin. Dunno which room, but by god something is gonna be pumpkin colored. Congrats Karissa! So many life events, so little time! I'll try and make it down to help you move in, specially if you supply the pizza and beer. Elizabeth hasnt puked yet, just feels nauseous. She can smell everything. Seriously, if there were a gas leak (either human or natural) in Arkansas, she could probably smell it. Her stomach is already poochy and she's getting stretch marks and vericose veins. She can yell at me and kiss my cheek at the same time. Odd, really. There is something fundamentally wrong about a white man and a pregnant chinese woman rolling in the Mitsubishi Grocery Getter singing "Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off".

 Congrats on the place Karissa. I can't believe you already have colors picked out. I would be by the seat of my pants kind of girl. Chris-That is so exciting that you got to see the heartbeat. These next few months are going to fly by, but it will be amazing to see the changes daily in Elizabeth. I wasn't too bad with the hormones but I was also puking up my toes the first 4 months. But this is the most rewarding thing that you and Elizabeth will ever do. I can't imagine my life w/o Emily and can't remember what it was like to be w/o baby!

 Would it be funny to anyone else if there was a cop with the last name Bacon? The condo comes with white horizontal blinds, but there's nothing saying we couldn't paint them a different color with acrylic paints. I'm not sure how dark I want to go, though, even in my bedroom. Caribbean colors... hm... Not yellow, though. My sister painted her bathroom yellow, but either peach or teal (a color I normally hate, but it could look really neat with the beaded shower curtain I'm going to make), that's a good idea. I'm still thinking about a beach mural, too. Sand about half way up the wall and then ocean and sky, and maybe a volcano...:) Keep the ideas coming!

 I'm thinking a bright sunshine yellow for the bathroom- if it's tiki, that says sun and beach to me. So bright caribbean colors. So either a coral peach color or a bright sunshine-y yellow....that's my vote. Ok- you don't have to have curtains- but what about blinds? the kind that are dark wood that are like horizontal blinds? Anyway- just a thought....

 I get caught playing computer games all the time. I really hate that. No one says anything, but I know they are thinking that I'm a slacker. At least with email I can pretend that it's work-related. Not blogging, but real email. You know, you could pull up a Word document, type stuff in that and then cut and paste, then you could pretend you were doing real work. That would be cool. :) I can't have curtains. There are these little fuzzy people I live with who think that my regular furniture is for climbing. I don't want to tempt them with long pieces of cloth hanging on a pole. The only color problem I'm having is wondering what color to do the bathroom. If it's a Tiki lounge, what should it be like? I can't have actual tiki torches because even if I brought in a pot of sand or something, that's like inviting the cats to poop outside the litter box. I know I want it to be done in light colors because it's not a huge room, but I keep envisioning it as something deep red, like Mount Wanna-hock-a-lewgie, or any other volcano. I don't know. I know I'm going to get some hanging lanterns, and I already have some Christmas lights in blue and green (maybe that would be better in the living room, I don't know), but I'm just having trouble coming up with a basic color scheme. Maybe I'll get Abby to paint me a mural of something in there, but then we come back to the question, a mural of what? Suggestions here would be greatly appreciated. What can I say? When I get excited, I plan...:)

 I have no problem with orange. My bathroom will be orange eventually. Good lord, you have thought about this. When we moved in, we had no plan in mind whatsoever. We just threw up colors that we liked. Most worked, some didn't. I hate getting caught by the boss writing on this. Write more later.

 Does it have to have a theme, per se? I saw a really cool blue room on Queer Eye once that was blue (it was the BBQ'd toupe for those who watch). It had dark wood for the furniture and bed, etc- and the linen's were a white bedspread (you could go light blue here too)- and then the curtains were white as well. The walls were a very rich blue- but not overly bright- it was VERY cool. And for wall decor, you could pick a theme- maybe even abstract art (think "Wassily Kandinsky (artist)"). And have small prints framed all around the room to create a border.....

 Alright, ladies and gentleman, the votes are in, the score has been tallied and the decision agreed upon by many banks and loan officers. I'm a homo-ner (preservation department dialect, you know). Officially, or nearly so. I got the final go ahead yesterday from Lisa. The only thing they need is confirmation from Discover that my monthly payment isn't what they keep saying it is, and we are golden! You heard it here first, and know before my parents or grandparents! My folks are on vacation and I can't remember what I did with their contact info. I woke up at 5:30 this morning and couldn't get back to sleep because I was thinking about how I'm going to decorate my house. I actually have basic plans for every room except my bedroom, so any suggestions on that (keep it clean, ladies; remember my parents will eventually be seeing the place, and I don't know how I could explain the whips and chains without coming off as a little scarey). So, here's the rundown. Kitchen: Originally I thought I'd go with a Chinese rock garden theme, but then I remembered that my canister set is more art nouveau, so I'm going to try to find some prints and hang them in there. To get the feel for what I'm looking for, run a search on Alphonse Mucha. I love his art, and sometimes you can even see BOOBIES . Living room: The kitchen and living room share a wall so I'm going to paint them both the same color. I'm going to go with a light green, something that's alive, not minty. You know what I mean. And since I couldn't pull the Chinese rock garden off in the kitchen, we're going to move it out to the living room. Clean lines, simple color, I'm going to hang the pictures of the family instead of putting them on a shelf like I've been doing. Eventually I'm going to put up a shelf around the room and put rocks and maybe some plants up there, but I have to figure out a good height where I can reach it but the cats can't. We'll see. I'm also going to put some shelves up over the TV for videos, DVDs, and stone displays. My geode collection shall be appreciated by all...:) Bathroom: Think Tiki lounge. 'Nough said. Second bedroom: I'm going to paint this room orange, and no, I shant be talked out of it. I'm going to make it into a cave in Southwest colors. It's going to be office/library/ritual space and I want to set it aside as such. Yes, it's still a spare room and people will be able to sleep in it, but I still have some neat ideas for it. Like hanging candles at the cardinal points. If I take a couple of terra cotta flower pot water catcher dishes and decorate them with mosaic tiles, I can suspend them and use them as candle holders. They will be pretty and useful. I'm also going to have my parents bring my desk down, so we can repaint that to fit in better, or strip it down and refinish it someday. Right now, paint sounds easier than sanding, even if I borrow Sarah's sander, but we'll see. And that leaves my bedroom. It'll be blue or lavender. That's all I've got so far. And I want to put my rainbow spiral hanging in there, so think about that as you work on your designs. There will be a contest and the winner will be given the right to give me large amounts of money...;) Ok, and a heads up here. My sister is selling Pampered Chef stuff. If you are interested, the company is currently having a fund raiser for the Breast Cancer Society (I hope you've all been clicking at the Breast Cancer Site every day). They have made four items especially for the cause and each item has something pink on it so you'll know that's what it's for. I'm going to bring the catalog of regular stuff to Em's house this weekend, but if you are interested in ordering for the Breast Cancer people, here is a brief description of what they have to offer: 1.) Mini Stainless Steel Whisk $9.50 2.) Microfiber Towel $8.50 3.) Mini Measure-All Cup $5.50 4.) Pink Lemon Aid $7.00 If you are interested in taking part, a dollar from each purchase will be donated to the cause. I can send you a flyer if you would like more info and a description of each item. If you'd like to order anything else from Pampered Chef, you can go to their website and then let me know and I'll hook you up. The Breast Cancer thing doesn't officially start until May, so if we get an order together by then or shortly after, Steph will send it in and we'll get our stuff. If you have any questions, let me know and if I don't know the answer, I'll find out. :)

 Hell, I don't care.

 Cara, hope you don't mind me taking out the double post. I have administrative priviledges, you know. :) I can't spell, but that doesn't take away my power...:) They can take our lives, but they canna take our trousers! - Terry Pratchett, Wee Free Men

 I saw Kill Bill Vol 2 and loved it. It's much funnier than the first one.

 em, that does suck. sounds like they are trying to get as much out of you as possible. i hate apartment complexes. they one i live in now is 8 units and they landlord is really nice. we signed a 6 month lease 2 years ago and never renewed it. we just keep paying rent and he doesn't bother us. i hope you can find a way to work it out with your landlord/co. cara, i personally like jumbalaya better than gumbo. beingets are good, especially with their cafe au lait or hot chocolate. :) and tell bob that is does NOT snow here. once 10 years ago they had a little bit where the kids could make pathetic little snowmen, but it wasn't much i was told. i saw a few flurries the first winter i was here and that was because it was unusually cold. so, no snow. but it does get really humid. adam said that it's worse in arizona because desert heat is still hotter than really humid heat, so i think bob would be able to handle it. it gets humid in indiana so just imagine that type of weather only longer down here. i like it, it's really not that bad. plus- if you ever want to see a hurricane... :) i am going to see kill bill 2 very soon. we have the first one and i really like it. i like tarintino's style.

 Kill Bill Volume 2. Most excellent.

 What's the deal with all these closing problems?! This sucks, guys. Hopefully it will work out, Karissa. This weekend I'm going to look at reception/wedding sites with Kristie. I'm overly excited for some reason. I think it's because our conversation was normal and not the least bit akward. She even lost the squeak in her voice. I can't wait to give her her birthday present which will work really well for the occasion. For my "girls night out" i came up with a great theme but it will never work with these women. I wish I had "girls night out" with you guys so I could have my bachelorette party themed night. It would work really well in preparation for Em's but these girls are too up tight for that. So I'll probably have a hawaiian/summer theme thing instead. YAWN.

 Heres the deal. Apparently, when you buy a condo, a certain percentage of the units have to be owner occupied. If they are not, as they often aren't in college towns, the bank looks at the property and decides it's more of an investment property than an place where I would actually want to live, and if it's going to be an investment, it's going to have a higher interest rate. Now, I think this is stupid because this is the place I want to live for a while and I have no intention of renting it out, at least until I move in a couple-5 years or so. But, because there are so many renters, it's screwing with my loan. I was summarily rejected. Lisa, my mortgage lady, is still working on this and I told her I'd give her until next week to see if she can't find someone to do the loan. It'll all be ok, I'm sure, but I hate the fact that someone is fucking around with the one thing that is my saving grace. Moving into this place, painting it, and making it mine has been the one thing that's really kept me going recently. The whole idea of it makes me happy. I need to not live in my apartment anymore. It's saturated with all memories Brian and I need out. I need to be in a place where I can't look out the windows to see if someone is walking by, or glimpse one of the neighbors taking their dogs to the back yard for a run and get all hopeful that it's Brian come to surprise me. I need a place that's all mine, and that's what this condo is. I'm not giving up yet, but it's really hard to deal with things being in upheaval again. We were going to close today, and it didn't happen. We can only hope it'll work out and get me in the place soon. I need to move, paint, and get ready to throw Polly's bridal shower by the end of the month, and then I'll be planning my house warming party and after that, I can settle in and really enjoy living in a place I own. Then I locked myself out of my house last night. I still have no idea how I did it. I went out to put my left-over breadsticks in the faery tree, pulled the door shut behind me and then couldn't get back in. At least one of my neighbors was home and Sarah had her phone on so she was able to come over and let me in. It was just crazy. Oddly, I'm still in a good mood. I'm not going to fight it, but it is a bit puzzling...

 Steph, if you get that double- are you renting out the other side? The reason I ask is that my brother will be moving there in July to go to Tulane (he accepted). I don't know if he's planning on on-campus housing, but I thought I'd ask so I could pass it on if you are going to rent it.

 Ok. PUKE

 shit- i just posted this long thing and the goddamn internet went out and now there is nothing up. shit, i;lll send it again a little later.

 Maybe from now on, you should refer to it as PUKE

 Steph, I forgot to tell you that I saw the listing of the house. Very cute. Your floors look like ours! Let us know how things go. Good lord. I thought I was going to puke because I hadn't eaten in like 2 days....now I feel like I'm going to puke because I ate too much. This sucks. Husband had 2 cigarettes yesterday. He was having a very bad day and he said he needed them. First one made him want to puke....so why smoke a second??? The damn waitress at the bar gave them to him. I'm very curious whether or not his friends will say anything to me about it. I don't think I've ever written this much about puke in a blogger before...

 Karissa, I wish I could buy something right now- but money is SO tight until we hear about Marshall's strike. We THINK we might find out by the end of today- but we'll see. I'll let you know- when is the deadline?

 Em, if you'd like to talk to my sister, I can give you her phone number. She's going through the same thing with Joel right now and there are days when it really sucks. Throw her losing her job into the mix and you have one stressed-out type-A personality. At least you don't have kids yet, so that really is one less thing to worry about at the moment. Which reminds me, any takers on Pampered Chef stuff? They have an online catalog if you want to go look at that and then I can take orders and get that sent in next week sometime.

 OK- General Opinion Poll: Picture this- Let's say that your significant other is very unhappy with their career. Their job is good, they make good money- but it doesn't challenge them or spark their creativity at all. Let's say that they can go back to school, but will have to get a 2nd Bachelors to be able to do what they want to do. While planning a wedding, trying to buy a house and considering kids in the next year and a half or so- how much would this stress you out? I'm 100% supportive of the idea of Marshall going back to school for what he wants, but what it all means is what scares me. Another $25,000 or so of school debt (though his credit card debt is non-existant). Then most definitely having to move after he's done- there are NO jobs in this field in Indiana, the closest would be Chicago, but that's still a longshot. We'd probably be looking at San Jose/Bay Area or Dallas. I realize this isn't probably for another 4 years or so- but we decided last night that Marshall may start back to school in January. I told him that as long as it's after the wedding, and that we buy a house first so that our money isn't still being wasted on rent- I'm behind him. I don't think I ever saw someone so happy and in the moment. It was cool. He can get a degree from the School of New Media at IUPUI with a specialization in Game Design which is what he wants to do. He could also do it at ITT Tech. The decision will probably be contingent on if he could do it with night school and weekend classes at IUPUI. Because he will keep his well-paying job at SBC while going to school. Just wanted to share- interested to hear your feedback- I'm happy for him but stressed too....such is life.. So Chris- how's it feel to be a homeowner?

 Sorry for the bout of Tourettes. We are closing in 2 hours, hooray. We had our walk through last night, and she left the place a filthy mess, boo hiss. She made a $42,000 profit in 1 1/2 years, ya think she could spring for a $100 cleaning service??? Anyway, tis almost over. Thanks for your suggestions of brutality though : )

 I hate my jobI hate my jobI hate my jobI hate my jobI hate my jobI hate my jobI hate my jobI hate my job I'm nothing more than a semi-glorified admin asst taking orders from a half-wit brit. I'm in such a quandry because I want to leave this job for something else- but I just hired a summer intern (I had to or not have one all summer if I'm stuck here). But why can't people realize that I'm NOT the mail room girl? If they need something mailed - MAIL IT- just like I do when it's my own materials going out. This just pisses me off to no end. I mean, don't get me wrong- I have no problem doing it for someone. But if they send the request to a collegue in their dept, why would that collegue forward it to me other than just being lazy? *end vent*

 That is such a good idea! Well, the movie thing. Not that kicking the mortgage company's butt wouldn't be fun and worth while, but I love it when movie theaters and places like that come up with ideas that benefit real people. It's like when I first saw the pregnant woman parking at the grocery store. Someone out there was thinking. Make the mamas happy and they will tell their friends so their business will be better. Very cool. They get gold stars from me. :) Oh, and just so you know, the waiting period to buy a handgun does not apply to the purchase of rifles or other firearms. Just something to keep in mind when dealing with mortgage people in the future.

 Chris that sucks about the mortgage company. I can beat them up for you if you would like. Now that I am a mommy I am getting huge mommy biceps! The answer to the movie question-if you want to see a movie while Liz is pregnant take her when she is not tired and make sure that you get an aisle seat. Real long movies toward the end of her pregnancy will be rough b/c her back will start to hurt. Haven't seen a movie yet since the baby has been born. But Loews theaters offers on Tuesday a movie during the day that you can take your baby with you and they don't lower the lights all the way and they lower the sound a little so that a sudden sound won't upset babies.

 We just got some pretty decent news. Though we are still in limbo about the strike, we found out that no other offer has been made on the house. Please send some happy thoughts our way that the strike stuff will be resolved and we'll be able to buy this house- I had non-stop dreams about it last night. Chris- SO sorry to hear about what happened. Honestly, I think you should be able to sue. Either that or have them eat the closing costs. Bastards. Best of luck - let us know what happens. Ok- I've had 2 decent days in a row (Friday and Monday) at work- if today is good, I'm going to be weirded out.

 Damn, Chris...that sucks. I don't know what else to say. I wonder if you could sue the mortage company or something. At least make them pay for rent or something. Liz being pregnant makes everything worse. You can always stay with us if worse comes to worse.

 Holy fucking shit goddamit son of a fucking bitch cock sucking piece of steaming dung flung from a red assed baboon with nipple rings freak ass piece of monkey shit. When buying a home, make sure your lender "has time" to get your fucking documents ready by the fucking closing date.....which was this morning....and didnt occur....because the FUCKING DOCUMENTS WERENT READY. Yeah, the Daryl Hannah scene....I'd pluck that motherfucker like I was picking a fucking tomato off the vine. Goddam incompetence. Greasy motherfuckers. Made a pregnant woman cry. We close on Wednesday but the sellers are pissed. Fuck em. If they dont come through by Wednesday, we have a chance of the sellers backing out, leaving us homeless and defaulting on our mortgage. Other than having our heat and electric shut off tomorrow, I'm swell. Fuck everything. I need a drink.

 Saw Kill Bill Vol. 2 yesterday- OH MY GOD that movie freaking rocks. Cara- the one scene- you know, with Darryl Hannah (don't want to spoil it for others)- it FAR outdoes the ear scene in Res Dogs. I LOVED this movie. Marshall asked me if I liked Vol 1 or 2 better. Here's what I think- one couldn't exist without the other- it's more like one movie, just in two sittings (brilliant marketing move btw). However, if I had to say which one I enjoyed sitting through more- Vol 2 hands down. Tarantino came back in a big way. I'll be curious to see if this launches a post-career career for Darryl Hannah like it did for John Travolta. She was awesome in this movie. Quite a step past the mermaid in Splash. Happy B-day Steph- hope you got my e-card! Hope it was a great day!

 HAPPY BIRTHDAY STEPHANIE! I sent you an e-card but it's to your taurus account. Hope you had a great day....

 Dammit Chris- you don't post for WEEKS (or at least it seems) and THAT is all you post? sheez. Cara- I was disappointed. It was a lot less climactic than I thought it would be. It was like, too predictable that Rachel would come back, in just that way. And the whole Mike/Phoebe thing about having a baby was just thrown in there. It was like, there was never really much of a wind down to the show- it was just all the sudden DONE. I didn't cry- and I was fully prepared to.

 Monkey nuts

 Good lord, I'm bored. 1 1/2 more hours until I'm outta here. 3 more hours until girls night out. What did you guys think of the last episode of Friends??

 Ok- live from York, PA: Highlight of the day- making it to PA on time and no plane crash Lowlight of the day- getting up at 3:45. I got less than 4.5 hours sleep- and I'm about to crash. Hope everyone has a good weekend!

 Highlight of the day (so far): It hasn't rained and I scraped up enough cash to go out for lunch. Lowlight of the day (so far): Almost bursting into tears over a friendship book I read at Hallmark. I'm such a sap. Potential Lowlights: Last episode of Friends, more yard work at home.

 Highlight of the day (so far): Driving to work, mailing my bills so I have one less thing to worry about, and PIZZA PARTY for lunch! Lowlight (so far): Knowing that the pizza is going to come from Avers. *spew* What can I say? I'm in a good mood. You should see my living room right now. It's about a third filled up with boxes. I've been trying to hit the kitchen all week and haven't made it there yet. I did tape all of my Pizza Express cups together last night, though. I just don't see the point in wasting a box on them when packing tape works so well. Oh, and when I bought the first rolls of packing tape, I got a sample of that tear by hand stuff. I don't know if I like it or not. I certainly don't trust it. I used it to tape the tops of boxes, not the bottoms, and even then I didn't use it that much. I used it for other things, but I can't seem to remember what those things were now. Why so interested in tape all of the sudden? It's my life, baby! Yea! And I'm just in a good mood. Don't fight it, just giggle with me...:)

 Damn. Lowlights of my day (so far): Marshall woke up EXTREMELY grumpy so we argued FIRST thing out of bed. My bosses wife DID not go into labor, which means I have a 3 o'clock meeting with him and can't leave early even though I have to get up at 3:00am for my flight tomorrow. (this will switch to a highlight should his wife go into labor soon). Highlight of my day (so far): I made it to work on minimal gas.

 Update: the HIGHLIGHT of my day: Someone actually booked me as their wedding coordinator! I'm so excited about this- through word of mouth and meeting with her once, she wants to PAY me to help her coordinate her wedding...yes ma'am, I will do just that.

 This is hard to answer today- any other day it would probably be easy. Highlight of my day (so far): The Krispy Kreme donut I treated myself to this morning. I haven't had a donut in a really long time- and I had a strong craving for one today. So I did it. Lowlight of the day (so far): Having to haggle over advertising prices with a competitive newspaper. My boss is "preening" me to be a master negotiator. At least he's freaking helping me. Funny thing though- I saw a job listing yesterday for a marketing manager at Thomson that sounded perfect for me. I'm goign to send my resume- just in case- but I thought it looked cool.

 Highlight of my day (so far): Finding a lost cat toy in my shoe. Lowlight of my day (so far): Spilling chicken fried rice all over the counter in my rush to get to work. What's yours?

 FELIZ CINCO DE MAYO!!

 Karissa- how come the cats can't stay with you at her place, or do they not allow cats? If we didn't already have 2, I'd offer to help- but we just can't right now. I'm sure you'll find something 10x better. Good news about having somewhere to stay though until you close on something else. Steph- Vince will be moving with his girlfriend (she's in CA with him now)- but they've already lived together, so it shouldn't be a problem. I'm not sure if he'll have a car or not- I know he has one now- so I think there will be one car. I'm going to email him right now and copy you so that he can contact you if he wants....and just let me know when/if you guys are going to close on something! He'll be moving at the end of July though- so it would have to be soon I guess- but either way- if he did live next to you, he'd be able to help out at any remodeling you guys need to do. Chris- are you still out there?

 Well, I now have one less thing to worry about. If you didn't get the email I sent this morning, let me know and I can send it again. But since my cousin is going home for the summer, I can stay at her place until I close wherever I close. Now I just have to board the cats and we'll be all good. I keep laughing about all of this crap and I think the people here think I'm weird. It's either laugh or cry, and I'd rather laugh right now. So, just chuckle along with me and it'll all work out for the best. :)

 hey girls/guy, karissa- wanted to let you know i did get your message, thank you!! i just haven't been able to call back i've been so busy. my parents left here on thursday and we had adam's brother and his kids at our apartment this weekend. aahhhhh! enough to make me want to wait to have kids of my own- probably has to do with the fact that they don't listen very well. :) the 3 year old boy, sylvan, is really smart AND hyper and is as big as a 5 year old so he's hard to "control" for lack of a better word. maisy is 2 at the end of the month and she cries at anyone and everything unless her daddy is holding her, but she is cute. and julie is great- going into 6th grade next year and definitely more mature than she should be. and i'm back at work today after missing 4 days and jesus is there a lot of work. i think i will be so tired tonight. but i am really looking forward to an everything bagel after work first. if i don't make sense i will later. i've just been non-stop on the go all day. oh yeah, em- if we get a double (or bigger) i will definitely let you know. vince seems like a really cool guy the time i met him and i think he would be one of the prefered renters we would look for. does he have a car he is bringing? we are trying to find a place close to the streetcar, but just in case... it's not a big city and anywhere we are looking and will buy a house at is still close to the universities. jen- how's emily grace? did you ever get that card i sent you? those pictures are cute! karissa- i hope everything is working out for your condo. technicalities suck! i'm sure you'll be fine though. cara- when's kristie's wedding? does that guy have sex 4 times a day EVERY day? that would start to be impossible for the guy i would think. that guy from the band three dog night had sex so much his penis kind of exploded on the inside- not to pieces of course, but he definitely injured something and couldn't have sex for a long time. gross.

 I'm bored, very bored. And not much can make me content at the moment. I simply don't want to be at work. Thank god I have to go out of town this Friday- it sort of cuts my week up. Where is Chris?

 I think we found Kristie's dress! http://www1.davidsbridal.com/bridalgowns_return.jsp?fc=Bridal+Gowns&pg=Oleg+Cassini&pageno=1 If anyone is interested, it's the last one. When I click on the full summary, it only shows the back. It looks amazing on her. What's really unique about it is that it's not your typical white dress. It's like this rum color and she positively glows. Yes, it's $850 for a David's Bridal dress but I really hope she's picks it. Nothing else new here. Still recovering from my cold. Going to Ellen and John's house today and we're supposed to meet JR's new girlfriend. He says he has sex with her 4 times a day. I don't know if this is all at once or during different times of the day. I don't know how you would get anything done. I think there is something wrong with him. Bob doesn't think he's lying.

 Alright guys, I just saw Troy and let me tell you IT SUCKS. I rank it up there with Gladiator. Now I know how you all feel about Gladiator but you all know how *I* feel about Gladiator. Brad's butt couldn't even sway me out of being annoyed and bored with this one. Brad had one decent scene that I thought lived up to his typical acting skills. I was distracted by his too blonde hair and wondering if those were really his legs. Because of the hair and the skirts, I confused him for a woman in distant shots. You know who I can't stand? Orlando Bloom. He's the biggest wuss out there and lord does he play a pussy in this movie. I was muttering under my breath the entire time that guy was on the screen. It was melodramatic and shot horribly. I knew I wasn't going to like it after 5 minutes and I was checking my watch after the first hour, not realizing that there was 2 more hours to go. Bob didn't think it was THAT bad but I wasn't impressed at all.

 Well, as always, the soap opera of my life continues. After posting the update about the failed sublet this morning (which, if I took it to small claims court I could probably win since we had a verbal agreement and he backed out), I spoke with Jim Canary. I'd overheard him tell Garry that Tony, our intern from last year, was back in town, so I thought maybe he would be looking for a place. While Tony isn't looking for a place, Jim has some friends who are going to be in Bloomington working on a project with Lilly and they need a place to stay. When I got the message yesterday that the sublet fell through, after throwing a temper tantrum and going to work out extra hard at the pool, I looked at the situation logically. Throughout this entire process, things have fallen apart, come back together, and the situation has improved because of it. The first condo fell through in favor of a place that suits my taste and needs. I was approved for a non-conforming loan that actually had a better rate than the conforming loan Lisa was trying to get me into. Now the sublet falls through, and while it's frustrating and really pissed me off, I had a hunch it happened for a reason. My horoscope today even backed that up. If you're not overwhelmed, you're not paying attention. There's so much going on around you now it's amazing you're still (relatively) sane. It'll pass before you know it. Everything happens for a reason, and this has been a test of character from beginning to end. I'm sorry to subject you all to such drama on a daily basis. Things will calm down eventually. Everything will work out for the best. But I wanted to thank you all for the emotional support you've been giving to me. This whole thing might have been unbearable had I not had so many good friends to lean on and talk to as everything happened. I know, that's what friends are for, but I wanted to say now, while I'm thinking about it, how much I appreciate you. The soap opera will end soon, and at that time we'll party like it's 1999. :) In the mean time, we'll just have to laugh at the drama and know it will end for the best. All good things. No worries. Love you all.

 The other shoe dropped. The one thing I wasn't worried about anymore fell apart. Yesterday, my subletter fell through. Never in my life have I wanted to strangle and 85 year-old man as much as I wanted to last night. A day and a half before he was supposed to move in. Like I don't have enough to do. At least that meant I didn't have to do anything last night. I have another whole week to finish packing and cleaning. Oddly, this doesn't make me that happy. If anyone buys a lottery ticket and wins, can I just borrow $1500 to cover my rent? Listing the good things this setback has made possible: 1.) I no longer have to board the cats, so I won't have to do without them next week. 2.) I will be able to catch up on my sleep so maybe I won't be such a flighty bitch next week. 3.) I have time to finish packing and cleaning. 4.) I will now only have to move once instead of twice, which is kind of a novel concept for me. I don't think I've moved just once since undergrad. OK, help me out here, kids. Reasons it sucks are much more numerous so I'm not even going to bother listing them. Let's see what good things come of this and go from there. In the mean time, I'm going to go run an ad in the paper and make up some more fliers for campus.

 Chris, I just read your post about moving into your new place. How did I manage to miss that? Now I'm all paranoid about missing stuff people write all the time. Well, I would be paranoid, but I don't feel like it. Maybe after lunch...

 I have no idea about next weekend yet. I need to make it through this weekend before I can even think about planning that far ahead. What we'll probably do is have one or two people at my Dad's house in the morning to load the truck up and then we'll either meet somewhere in Bloomington and all caravan to the new place or I'll attempt to give out directions so we can meet there, or some combination of the two. Yeah, I'm not really coherent at the moment, so planning for something that's more than just a few hours away isn't working for me. I've been making a copy of my posts before I hit the post button so at least I don't have to rewrite the whole thing if it doesn't work. I'm sure once they get all the bugs worked out this format will work better. I just switched the template to give us a new look; that shouldn't effect posting abilities. We all need some variety in our lives, right? And naps. Definitely more naps...

 Well that sucks- I had just posted and then it froze, and the post was deleted. Yes- this new format sucks. Try again- karissa- what time will you want us to be wherever you want us to be on 5/22? And will we be meeting in Whiteland or Bloomington? Just trying to do a little planning- don't need all the specifics, just ballparks here...k? Thanks!

 I had a weird dream, too. I was in my new place and it had a secret hole in it that all of these cats were using to come in and pee on things and tear up my stuff. It wouldn't have been so bad if all of the cats didn't look kind of like my cats so I had to be really careful about who I was throwing out. And I think Danielle and Aja's cat was at my house, too, so I had to be careful not to throw him out, either. I think I ended up plugging the hole by placing a rug under the front door so it couldn't open. Just weird. Think I need to get more sleep? I sure as hell do. Next week will be lovely. No packing, no boxing, only work and swimming and sleep. Now, caffeine.

 I dont like this format either. I posted something the other day and it didnt stick. I had another dream about you kids last night. Strange indeed...

 I hate this new format. I was at Emily's last night and did a huge post and it didn't take. Nothing new here. Emily got her shots on Monday and it was pretty traumatic for the mama.

 Cara, I don't know what to tell you. Never promise not to hit her in the face, I guess. That's just hilarious, though! Tell her not to put her face where balls are going to be. Not just a good suggestion when playing catch, either...;)

 Why children make me nervous: Emma: Aunt Cara let's play ball. Aunt Cara: Ok. (picks up ball) Emma: Now don't hit me in the face. Daddy sometimes hits me in the face with the ball. Aunt Cara: Well that's not very nice. I won't hit you in the face with the ball. Emma: Are you sure you're not going to hit me with the ball? Aunt Cara: Yes, I promise I will not hit you. Bob would be very upset with me if I hit you. Are you ready? (Emma's arms out): Yes. (Aunt Cara barely tosses it and hits her in the face.) Bob: CARA!

 If anyone comes across those new andy warhol Campbells soup cans at the grocery store, pick me up the set of three and I'll gladly pay you back. thankyouverymuch.

 I don't mind the new look so much as I think it's tedious to have to click on each one rather than scroll through. That's one thing I really like about LiveJournal because everyone can have their own journal, but there can be groups and also comments posted to an individual post. My head is reeling. I have so much to do at work, and no desire to do any of it. My boss is out all week, and I am out of town on Friday, but my desk is covered in crap and I see no way to dig through. And thank god for eBay, I love that site. It's helped to furnish 1/2 of my wedding.

 Wow. Now I know what you're all talking about. I don't know if I like this or not. It's all weird. What if I need to look at someone else's post to remember to respond to something? Hm. Too much change all at once. They may suck soon. I just don't know.

 Nothing new here. Just wanted to see if the damn thing was still posting.



 You know, as much as I'm looking forward to getting married, I can't wait for the wedding to be over. I'm stressing over things that SUCK to be stressing over and it makes me feel like a bad person because I make everyone around me stress out. So, just up front and out loud, I'm sorry if I do something to upset anyone during this whole process, I don't mean to- it's just stress.

 Em...I'm ordering my bridesmaid dress right now. It took them forever to find your stuff but I think it's under control now. I still can't see the other posts. I tried clicking on the words but nothing came up. I'm an idiot, I guess. Someone email me and keep me company. Work sucks today and I threw a hissy fit. Not as bad as Tony Soprano or his sister, but close. I could easily get there if pushed.

 Cara- click on these words. I'm finding that if you click on the words, then it opens up the post and you can see all of it. Or you can just go to the View Blog page and it opens it all up. Glad Girls Night Out was fun- sounds like fun. I didn't call my mom- but that's because she was with me in York, PA! Her and Rachel came over on Saturday to spend the afternoon and hang out- it was nice. Unfortunately, I came home to some bad news- my grandmother (dad's mom) had a massive heart attack. I guess she's ok- but she was at my dad's house visiting (thank god) and had to be lifeflighted from his front yard to the hospital. It's been pretty traumatic on my dad- he's so looking forward to the wedding- just so we have something FUN to celebrate with the family, other than another funeral or sickness.

 Hey womenses. Sorry for my ill communication. I think our home computer was damaged during the move. Or it could just be that it's a piece of shit EMachine...anyway, I've had limited internet access. The move went well...three hispanic guys loaded and unloaded our stuff in 2 1/2 hours. God bless them. While we were unpacking the second bedroom, heretofore known as The Baby's Room, we noticed water dripping from the ceiling. While we were unpacking the kitchen, heretofore known as The Kitchen, we noticed additional water dripping from a light fixture. After a brief bout of tourettes, we called anyone and everyone to get things resolved. Finding a leak is not easy. We went through 4 plumbers and several walls until The Plumber, heretofore known as God, found the leak in less than 5 minutes. Our upstairs neighbors have a three level condo and they had water pooling around their third floor toilet. Um, gee, that's pretty easy to overlook. So, God replaced a couple of pipes and we've been leak free for 5 days. The adjuster is coming today to assess the damage and write us a check. Other than that, life is good. A friend gave us a ton of baby stuff (bathtub, play mat, etc.) and it's sitting in our living room. It wasnt until the wife and I sat down and stared at the stuff that the reality of babyness hit us. What an absolutely wonderful feeling, ya know? The wife is speaking cantonese to her stomach everyday and I have been singing songs that I make up. Apparently, there are kickball leagues in Chicago. I filled in for someone on Saturday. I had my turn "at bat" with a beer in my hand. Kickball...for adults. Chicago's 4 months of summer totally make up for the 8 months of winter hell. I'm not afraid to admit that I like Crate and Barrel. We're gonna fire up the grill pretty soon, anyone interested?

 Alright. I hate this. I can't see what other people have written so how am I going to respond to anything? I do like the new post feature. Happy anniversary everyone. This weekend went pretty well. Girls night out was a lot of fun. Chrissie created a spa in her basement. We did the face mask thing, the foot soak and used the massager. (Don't write anything sexual. You know what I mean. We also wore our pajamas so we were quite comfortable. The new girl didn't show so that made me relax a little bit. Next month is at my house! Hope you all called your mothers yesterday. My parents leave on tomorrow for Texas. They haven't said anything more about putting my cat to sleep and I'm hoping they will not tell me when they've done it. I guess it would be today, wouldn't it? I don't want to think about it anymore.

 Oh, and just another observation- we've been blogging for over a year now.

 This "new look" is very interesting. It's going to be hard to get used to.

 Good things - iced coffee with caramel sauce, "Ride" by The Vines, whole cashews. Bad things - malfunctioning technology, allergies, scratching your balls after chopping up a jalapeno. Yeah, Cara, you guys should come up/us down sometime soon. We are getting the hole in the BR fixed which will be a major mess, but that should be done late next week. My friend's band is playing next saturday, they get drunk and play for an hour. I'm doing nothing this weekend. And I like it. Em, sorry about the strike. According to the Tribune, it shouldnt last long. Unbelievable how many people are affected. Have a great weekend.

 Steph...What? They can't keep you from buying a house. I'm sure that's against the law. I want to hear more about this. Sorry to hear about the strike, Em. Hopefully it will only be for 4 days. Karissa...Find a subletter yet? That guy who was robbed was old, wasn't he? You would think he would know better than to leave his stuff out there. I bet he's wishing he took your apartment now. Jen...It was nice talking to you yesterday. Good to hear the Emily is doing well. Can't wait to see you both in a couple of weeks! Chris..You and Elizabeth need to come over or something. Or...I wanna see your condo on the INSIDE this time. Just no one man gay plays this time.

 sorry i've been m.i.a. guys. there's this house we're trying to get and i think the listing agent lady and the owner are determined we don't get it. so i am just a nervous wreck wondering what will come out of this. the other people trying to get it put an offer in after us and we offered $1000 more than the asking price. also it was our second offer. we are considered the "back up" offer and i am waiting to hear if the other people were able to get it or not. it doesn't seem fair and i will be pissed if we don't get it, but there doesn't seem to be anything i can do except pray for a miracle. there's more to it, but i can't get into it right now since i'm at work, but i will tell you either way how it turns out. cara- that's a funny dream! i wish i could remember mine lately. em- i hope you still have a chance at that house you want! jen- how are you and little emily? did you ever get my card i sent?

 Sounds like Bob feels like he has to either "shape up, or ship out!" :) That's REALLY funny. And I think it's a DAMN good thing that wives can't do that. There would be way too many PMS enlistings. I know I told some of you, but recently on a radio show I heard about this woman who had really bad PMS, and one particular day, the sound of her husband's voice was just driving her up a wall. So she asked him to drive to McDonald's to get her a coke (they were already in the car)- so when they got there, she asked him to go in and get it (of course, because she had cramps) and once he got inside, she left him there and drove away for 3 hours...they're divorced now . . . :)

 Bob had a dream last night that cracked me up. He dreamnt that, for a birthday present, I enlisted him in the Navy. He was going to be gone for 2 years and he couldn't even drink beer at his party because he was shipping off in the morning. He said that in the dream I was trying to be nice and thought this was something he always wanted. He was just confused. Some present. Can you imagine how many wives would ship their husbands off to the navy if they could?

 this sucks i just posted something and it didn't go through. so lets try this again. i lost my cell phone so until i get a new one through my insurance claim you can reach me on John's cell (317) 698-5273.

 You know how I really love the idea of karma? Well, for any skeptics out there, here is a little fairy tale that might just change your mind. Once upon a time there was a girl who wanted to buy a place of her own. While the path was fraught with perils greater than she could ever imagine, she set forth with a pure heart and a feeling of confidence that she would find happiness somewhere she could call her own. One day, she located such a place and was thrilled to discover she could move into it immediately. This was a blessing and a curse, of course. While it appeared to be the home of her dreams, she didn't know what to do with the place she was living before she found this haven from the world. She asked her forest friends if they might know of anyone who needed a place to protect them from the elements. One wolf knew of a wanderer who was always looking for shelter, and sent him to find the girl. The wanderer appeared on her doorstep one evening before dinner. He look at the place, found it good and solid and agreed to move in that she might move out to her new heaven on earth. While a verbal agreement and a handshake usually settle these matters, the girl knew that not all people were trustworthy and went in search of a contract that would bind the agreement. This agreement was easily found, but by that time the wanderer had lost interest and left her high and dry, suspended between two houses. The girl wept a bit, gnashed her teeth and tore her hair for a short time, but then rallied and moved on with a light heart and a new lesson to take with her. One day, the wolf, who was greatly apologetic for getting her mixed up with the irresponsible wanderer, told her of a great misfortune that had been visited upon the old man. He had found a place to stay, near the dangerous Hill, a place where single women should never travel through alone and children couldn't play outside for fear of harm coming to them. As an older man, he felt himself wise in this endeaver. The payments were less, he could settle in sooner, and somehow he was happier there. The night he came to stay, he left all of his belongings in the world sitting on the street in his wagon. He was tired, and carrying heavy boxes didn't seem like a reasonable thing to do at the time. The next day, to his surprise, the only thing left on the street was an empty cart where his belongings used to be. When the wolf finished the story, the girl was sad that the wanderer had lost so much and hoped that he would find peace somewhere, but was just a bit heartened at the idea that justice had indeed been served.

 Em, I'm sorry to hear about the strike! That really sucks, but maybe it won't last long. I mean, if SBC came to the table last night, that means they're desperate to keep their employees, right? So, maybe they'll step up negotiations and get everyone back to work before the week is out. Fingers crossed! My insomnia is getting worse. Last night I did manage to sleep, but then I dreamed hard all night and woke up more disoriented than usual. Again, the alarm was going off and I kept trying to turn the radio up to make it stop, which obviously doesn't work since they are two completely different pieces of machinery. In the night, I dreamed I was eating a taco and then later we were at the grocery store buying bananas and we were making fun of them because they were so small. The bananas were the size of carrots, and we were making all kinds of crude jokes, because, let's face it, while bananas are tasty and nice, they are also quite phallic and require mocking on occasion. The funny thing is that I've been watching "Fight Club" while I get around in the morning. I don't think I'm too far away from making soap...;)

 My Striking Husband-to-be So, SBC came to the table during last minute negotiations last night and the CWA union said it wasn't good enough and that it was insulting. So basically, they are free to strike as of noon today- and I believe they'll do just that... Guess I'll start saying my goodbyes to the house right now. . . .

 Cable is covered by the HOA fee. No worries there. As long as I have power to my TV, I have brain candy...:) Em, I'm sorry about the strike. Let's just hope it doesn't last too long. I'll keep my fingers crossed for you.

 Karissa- what about cable? Not a necessity I guess- but it wasn't on your list. Anyway- sorry I've been sort of quiet as of late. It looks like SBC and the union are moving more towards a strike which means we'll be paying our bills on my salary only- which means that I do not get to go out and drink and dance. Boy how I would love it- but it's not going to happen now. In fact, we may have to dip into our wedding account to help- which I will only do as a VERY last resort...the up side is that it shouldn't last more than a few weeks and he'll still get paid what he's worked on this pay period- so it might just be missing one check- but that's still a lot! Anyway- We are probably also cancelling our trip to PA- because it doesn't make sense for us to spend the money on gas when we'll have a tough time paying other bills. Please just keep your fingers crossed for a quick resolution to this. And now, I must get back to work....REALLY- I need a day off...wanted to take off Friday, but I think we have a sales meeting....bleh.

 OK, what am I forgetting? I'm in the process of setting up utilities (electric, phone, water, no gas), I filed a change of address with the post office, I arranged to board the cats on Saturday (and must remember to take the shot records), I rented a moving truck, I'm pretty much finished packing and cleaning and I have a couple of extra boxes to carry the stuff I forgot to pack or have been using this week, I sent out a moving reminder, and I really feel like there's something I'm forgetting and I have no idea what it is. It's on the edge of my brain, just out of reach. People know I'm moving. People are coming to help (which I greatly appreciate). I have an ad in the paper to sublet my place (keep your fingers crossed). I don't know. There's something I'm not seeing. If you think of anything, email me. Well, you can email me anyway, but if in particular you read the list and think, oh, she forgot..., let me know. I must say I'm at a loss. And that so far Chris's idea of getting smashed and dancing sounds like a good idea. If I weren't so tired, I'd go do it now. All good things, kids. No worries. :)

 I have never in my life had such a tremendous desire to get fucked up and dance. Who's with me? Cara, your dream cracked me up!

 What does it mean when you have a dream about the men from Queer Eye for the Straight Guy take you trick or treating? Except...we never actually get to trick or treat, we just drive around really fast in a van all night while Decorator Tom does some sort of disco dance? We're all laughing hysterically and he's upset that we're not taking him seriously. It was really weird!

 I'm glad you posted about Troy- Marshall wants to see it really bad- and I had already told him to find another guy to go (which he will go anyway)- but I'm going to share the bad reviews. We went to Hollywood Bar & Filmworks again last night to see Kill Bill V2 again- I love that movie so much. The pizza wasn't bad either. I'm feeling kind of BLAH today. I think it's because I basically worked the last 2 weekends and haven't had much of a break- except for the movies yesterday. I think I'm going to take Friday off- but we'll see. I would be easily amused if anyone wants to send me email.

 I remember Liz and I laughing uncontrollably when we saw the previews for Troy...it just looked horrendous. Then it started getting great reviews and we thought maybe we'd break down and see it. Guess not! Wow, sounds horrible. A really good bad movie is the Rundown with the rock. Who knew? I actually thought I was going to make it through life without owning a ladder and/or any tools other than a hammer and two screw drivers. I bought a drill, saw, caulk, and a ladder this weekend. My wife used the word "caulk" in more than 35 different obscene ways.

 Mrs. C, I'm with you on this one. Yeah, I like Gladiator, but that had a lot more action and it wasn't a rip off of an epic poem. No, not a Homer fan, but if you're going to make a movie based on a Greek poem, at least get it right. I went to see it with Danielle, who studied Ancient Greek, and she was even more pissed about it than I was. Then again, if you read the original and not a translation, I think you have the right to be even pissier than the girl who barely remembers parts of the poem from high school. Still, I've read variations of the story by modern authors, and they all managed to follow the story line. Why can't Hollywood? I also think it's amazing that a war that lasted 10 years was whittled down to 2 weeks. Then again, it felt like 10 years by the time we got out of the theater, so I guess it worked. You know what the best part of the movie was? The trailers for other movies before the actual film started. I'm not sure I want to see the newest bastardization of the Arthur legend, but it looked fun, and for once Guinevere doesn't look like a whiney bitch with no brains of her own. It actually reminds me of the series I've been reading by Alice Borchardt, Anne Rice's sister. You want a beautifully written new version of the story, pick up The Dragon Queen. It's just fabulous. I can't wait until the third book comes out. I'm sure I will have forgotten what was in the other two by then, but what can you do? And, completely off the topic, Steph, I had trouble posting my message to the blog, but after that it was like the computer saved the path. I haven't hit the Preview key before posting, so I don't know what's going on. I've also just been copying everything before I post so if it goes away, I'll still have it and I don't have to try to remember everything I just wrote. Hopefully the Blogger people will work out their problems. In the mean time, email them and tell them what's happening and how bad this change over sucks so far.

 you HAVE to hit preview before it posts right.

 i hate this new one. i just published something and it immediately said nothing to post. twice now.

 Ok just finished catching up on everyone's posts. I can't believe that Amber was in labor for 25 hours. Poor girl. Was he a big baby? Also congrats on the thumb sucking Chris. It's so amazing to see the tiny thing that you and Liz have created. When John and I saw Emily on the sonogram I cried. She was kicking and moving a lot. She did that through out the pregnancy and she still does that. I swear she is going to get up and start running any day now. She is also the loudest farter I have ever heard out of a baby. She is one gassy little girl but she gets that from her daddy. I think some nights they compete with one another. Are you guys going to find out the sex? And have you guys come up with any names yet?

 Hey Everyone! Update I found my phone and restored service to it so you can contact me back on that number. Steph-Good luck getting the house. I am sure that everything will work out. What did you name the kitty? Also I did get your card that you sent it was really cute and much appreciated! Chris-June 26th definately won't work for me & John we are going to a wedding in Michigan, but July sometime should definately work. Just give us a date so John can ask off that weekend.

 thanks! wednesday afternoon the lady at the bank told me there was a problem and i thought i wasn't going to get the house. but then last night the seller's agent (which is kind of funny because the seller is the owner of the real estate co. selling the house) told me they are willing to go fha so now that's an even better deal for me. so home inspection on wednesday, i know things need to be fixed but the seller said as long as the report is specific she will do it- and should, she owns a real estate co.! so wednesday was the most up and down day i've had in a long time. then today is calm-er. :) em- GO FOR THE JOB!!!!! DON'T FEEL GUILTY!!! it's what you want and your job now doesn't treat you like they should. good luck at the interview- i know you'll do great. karissa- congratulations homeowner, i can't wait to get there also. i better get back to work, i've hardly done anything here this week and should get something done. what a week. everyone have a great and safe memorial day weekend!

 Em, maybe you're just allergic to PA. It happens, you know. Kind of like how I can always tell when we cross the border between Ohio and Indiana. It's almost as if the light is different there. Well, as of yesterday afternoon, I'm a homeowner. I took the afternoon off and drove up to Indy to deposit a check, came back down and signed a million-and-one-papers. Now I really have to pretend to be a grown-up. The roof I slept under last night belongs to me. The water I poured into the soup kettle came out of my faucet. My sheets are still sitting in my dryer waiting for me to remember to take them out and fold them and put them away. Oddly, none of this feels real yet. I still feel like I'm renting and have just moved. Ah, well. It's beautiful and I love it and it's nice to know I can stay. More unpacking tonight and tomorrow. And sleeping in tomorrow morning. Ah, blessed sleep! Tell me again why I'm not still home in bed?

 Well, we have an appointment with our realtor on 6/14 to go back to the house and walk through and possibly right up the offer. I know it's almost 2 weeks away, but if the house hasn't sold by now, we aren't too worried. We're off to PA after work today to visit my mom and sis and stepdad...should be fun. Just have to remember to pack my allergy stuff- PA allergies are worse than IN ones for me! Everyone have a great Memorial Day weekend!

 Chris, that actually works out better- i don't think we can make it on 6/26. I think we'll be helping his dad move then. Mid-July would be good I think.

 I'm an idiot. Elizabeth told me last night that she will be in Germany for work over June 26th, so that probably isnt a good time for a bbq. Then we thought about the 4th of July, but since I have so many vacation days I'm gonna travel somewhere...anywhere. Sooo, maybe a cookout sometime in mid-July??? We had our monthly prenatal checkup today. Jr. was sucking his/her thumb, which is really early for that to happen. The doc said it's a sign of intelligence : ) It was also burping quite a bit, just like pappy. Good luck Em, congrats Steph!

 Congrats Steph! I'll keep my fingers crossed for you! Hopefully with all this good news flying around everywhere, we'll all come out for the better! Let's just hope you don't have the closing problems that Chris and Karissa had! I'll let everyone know about the interview after I have it on Tuesday. You know what's funny is that now I have the chance to get another job, I instantly start feeling guilty about possibly leaving. But in the end, I try to remember that my career is just like any business- I have to look out for myself. Plus, I mean come on, HOW LONG have I wanted to be at an Ad Agency, and if someone is FINALLY willing to give me the chance and pay me what I need to make to come in, then I have to take it, right?

 hey guys, well i signed a contract on that house on monday. yes, the one i was bitching about being the first one to put in an offer, but the third one who got a chance at it. so now i am waiting to hear about the loan. wish me luck on that! this house is 2 blocks from the new canal street streetcar line, so it's prime location now. you can get to the french quarter and uptown from it. nice. also, did i tell you i have a kitty now? pure black with green and yellow eyes. she's so pretty. i dropped her off to get her fixed today and i almost cried. the poor thing seemed like i was leaving her for good. she wouldn't let go of me. em-congratulations on the new job prospect (and good luck), and on marshall's strike being over. i better get back to work. i'll keep you updated on the house thing.

 June 26 will work for me but not for Bob. Unless the party is after 5 and he just happens to get off at 5. I hate freakin' Wal-Mart. So I'll be going stag... Em and I were talking about having some sort of quarterly reunion where we all meet up at someone's house. I thought it was a good idea. I got invited to a girls night out where people actually GO OUT and stay out late! Too bad it's when I have too much stuff going on and probably won't be able to make it. It's with the women of Wal-mart and it would be interesting to see what they would have to say about my husband. Speaking of Mr. Cunningham, he drank too much last night and puked. He did the same thing around this time last year. I guess a yearly purge isn't such a bad thing... My parents and my sister are coming up this weekend. I'm very excited. Lisa's never been to the house yet!

 What, don't they interview on Fridays? I bet they'd get a lot more applications that way...;) Chris, as far as I know the 26th is open. I'll put it on my calendar now and see what happens. Would it be ok if I brought one of the girls up with me? I hate to drive that far alone, and Em can vouch for the entertainment factor of those involved with the move. ;) We'll have to do a tour of homes one of these days. I'm going to guess I'm next? Give me a month or so to stop feeling like I've been hit by a truck and to get the painting done and then you can all come and crash here. Doing the bed count, I'm coming up with 3 places for couples to sleep (guest bed, futon, air mattress), though the futon isn't really that comfortable. I'm going to have to save up for a new mattress for it, but until then we can just take it off the frame and people can sleep on it on the floor and that won't be too bad. Ok, I'm just babbling now. I should go get gluey and let the day begin. Or at least sit at my deck and stare blindly out into the rain. Either way...;)

 YAY ME!!! Possible new job on the horizon. I had put out a resume about a month ago and got a call for interview today. It's an assistant buyer position for an Ad Agency downtown. YES FOLKS, I said AD AGENCY- only my dream job. And if any of you remember, this is the one with BEER FRIDAYS. My interview is next Tuesday- PLEASE wish me luck!! :)

 I think June 26th will work for me but I'm not sure about Bob. I'm hosting girls night out on June 25th...My whole month of June is packed, I think. Poor Bob, I doubt we'll even have a weekend to celebrate his birthday. I feel kinda bad but I don't think he'll mind too much. Next year is the big one! A Serbian Card Party is more like a raffel. You buy a bunch of tickets and you hope to win crap. When I mean crap...it's crap. There are few really good prizes out there. But it's QUANTITY not QUALITY, as the Cunninghams say.... If anyone needs a place to stay for the cookout, let me know. By the way, Amber had her baby a few weeks ago. His name is Aidan James and she was in labor for 25 hours before they did a c-section!!

 Chris, I think June 26 would be a good weekend for us- unless we have to go help his dad move then. His dad and stepmom are building and will need us to help them move. The strike is officially over and there is a tentative pact between SBC and the union- and it's a good deal. They'll get $1000 lump sum payment (all active employees) and a 12% wage increase (retro to April 3) and then they will have to pay a little higher co-pays for health insurance, but not as much as originally proposed. So, I think it was a great compromise- plus they met the union with job security and increasing hometown jobs. I'm going to contact our realtor today and tell her that we want to meet her at the house again to walk through once more- and then we'll probably make our official offer. It will have to be contingent on a 60 day from acceptance of offer closing date (we have to give our apt complex 60 days notice). We can't make it contingent on finding a subletter, but that will be another thing we have to find. We'll even be willing to pay part of the rent and give someone a break to take over the lease, if we have to. Anyone know someone who needs an Indy apartment until December? Anyway- yes...good things....But Marshall got a true farmer's tan yesterday on strike duty. His poor knees are SO red!

 Em, looks like the strike is over, no? From what I've read, it sounds like a pretty good deal for the union. Hope things are calming down.... Oh, that song is Beautiful Night or something like that by the Burden Brothers. Cara, what in the world is a Serbian Card Party?? Congrats, Karissa. I'm going to come down and drink beverages in your new home. We are going to have a cookout on our deck sometime soon. Is anyone available June 26?

 I cant get this song out of my head. It reminds me of being 18 and stoned, riding in the back of my friend Derek's truck along the strip in Panama City. Ahh, to be young, scruffy and stupid. It's a beautiful night for feeling lonely A beautiful night for being afraid So raise your hands, you one and only's You one-of-a-kinds who feel this way I don't want to talk, don't want to explain it I don't want to fuck and I don't want to fight It's only a feeling, it's fleet and fading It's all over the world, and it's only tonight Cause it's a beautiful night, beautiful night, yeah Beautiful night, beautiful night to be here It's a perfect time for being wasted A perfect time to watch the stars So throw back your head Come on, embrace it It's a beautiful night, wherever you are It's a beautiful night Beautiful night, yeah Beautiful night Beautiful night to be here

 Hey! The move went very well, if I do say so myself. A huge thank you to Marsh and Em for the heavy lifting, and to everybody else for the moral support. The condo is great and already I'm enjoying the simple country life...;) Yeah, right. Let me start at the beginning. Saturday morning, I arose early, created the cats, picked up Sarah, and we took the kittens to Wayport Kennel out on 37 where they were paired off and put in kitty condos for the duration of their stay. From there, Sarah and I went up to Greenwood to pick up the 10-foot truck that I had confirmed the day before. Of course it wasn't there. The person who had been sent to pick it up hadn't made it back when he was supposed to, so Sarah and I waited. And waited. And then the best thing happened. Someone returned a 15-foot truck and the guy gave it to us for the 10-foot price and knocked the mileage down to 25 cents a mile instead of 79 cents. Needless to say, we got a great deal. The icing on the cake was the fact that the truck was brand new. The guy who returned it said there hadn't even been 50 miles on it when he picked it up in South Bend the night before. It was brand new and drove like a huge car. It was better than being a hog queen. I was driving a truck . From there, we went to my parents' house to pick them up and get their old mattress. Dad tied it in the back and we were off. Of course, as soon as we were on the road, everyone started calling my cell. It was kind of funny. They were all really evenly spaced calls and everyone wanted to know where we were. We were on our way, so I told them to help themselves to water or soda and the cable was still hooked up so they could watch TV, so even though they had to wait an hour, at least they were cool and comfortable (I hope; ask Em for sure). When we finally got there, I was amazed at how quickly everything found its way into the truck. In the time it took me to empty the fridge and freezer into the coolers, they had everything outside and in the moving van. Needless to say, I was impressed. From there, we began to caravan to the new place, which was not quite as easy as it sounds. First, I had to stop to pick up the keys, but since I didn't know where I was going, we stopped at the wrong place and I nearly didn't get the truck out. Then, when we finally got there and I found the realty office I needed, the map the people gave me to my condo sucked so bad I couldn't find the place anyway, so we ended up driving around for about 10 minutes until we stopped in front of my condo purely by accident. Seriously. I was having a dislexic moment and wasn't remembering the building number right, and there was another moving van blocking the access road we were on and I was pretty convinced we were going to have to get them to move out of our way. I started walking down the line of cars, telling people to just turn their cars off and leave them there and we would walk up to my condo, go in and have some cookies while we waited for the other people to move their van (we found out later that they were moving out and were taking my sister's approach which involves a lot more tossing crap in boxes at the last minute and means that your moving helpers have to pack as they go). So, we stopped and started walking back toward the moving van and, when the man asked if he was in our way, as I said yes, I happened to glance to my left and realized we were right there. And that really rocked. So we went in, had some snacks, and eventually started unloading the truck. Even that didn't take long, though we had to move some stuff downstairs via very steep wooden steps and some manuvering around other peoples' decks. Honestly, I didn't witness any of that because people were lost and calling my cell and I was telling them that I couldn't give them directions to my place because I had no idea how to get there in the first place and the only reason I found it was pure dumb luck. Yeah, I know I wasn't a whole lot of help, and I'm not going to be for a while. I'm still only finding the place on the first try about half the time. Let me drive it for a couple of weeks and then I can get directions figured out for everyone one else. After everything was unloaded, we all got back in our cars and drove to the Pizza King on South Walnut and had a great lunch. Yes, we were all stinky and sweaty, but that was part of the fun. We rested and talked and had a good time and then I had a hugging receiving line as people left, which was both nice and kind of funny, and the Sarah and I took the van back to Greenwood. The longest drive of the day, though, was the last one home. Sarah and I were so tired, it seemed to take forever. But we made it in one piece and I eventually got back to my house where I proceeded to unpack most of the kitchen. Yes, I still have some things that need to be put away, but I got most of it sorted out and put away. I even started unpacking the stuff in the second bedroom, but didn't get too far. Yesterday was a shopping day. I had to get some things from Lowes and Walmart, so I wandered around with Sarah and we had a good time. I replaced the showerhead in my bathroom downstairs (my shower the night before and cleaned, not only me, but everything in the bathroom as well). We went to the kennel and brought the kittens home and they are still not really sure what's going on or what to make of it, but I think they are enjoying having so many places to hide from me. Ada left a huge scratch on my neck when I picked them up from the kennel. It runs from just above my collar bone to my jawline. She still doesn't quite know how to deal with me. I can tell that she missed me because she comes up and rubs against me, but she's still pisses because any time I touch her or anyone else comes near her she hisses and bats at them. It's going to be a fun couple of days while they get adjusted, but I think they will be happy in the long run. :) And today I'm here at work. I'm going to take Thursday and Friday off to really work on the place and maybe even get some painting done, and since we have a three-day weekend anyway, I'm going to get plenty of rest and it's going to be lovely. :) We close on Friday at the latest, so the only thing left to worry about is subletting my apartment, which hasn't happened yet, and getting everything unpacked and put away. The only major things I have left to buy are shelves for my downstairs closet and paint supplies and a drill. So far, everything seems to be coming together, knock on wood. :) I'll let you know as things happen.

 I just now got what "Striking Husband-to-be" meant. I thought she meant he was attractive. Not that he's not... Our weekend was kinda quiet but it was nice. We went to the Serbian Card Party in South Bend and we won so much stuff it was embarassing! When we walked in Larry whispered "remember it's not the quality of what you win...it's the quantity!" It was a lot of fun. Kristie asked me to be her matron of honor on Saturday and Bob's going to be a groomsmen. Of course we said yes. I asked her about a bachelorette party and she didn't really answer me. She just looked uncomfortable so I dropped it. Maybe because Mike was there and I mentioned strippers. Even though I actually said "we don't have to have strippers..." Karissa...how did the move go? Ok the managers are gone for three days so please keep me busy.

 I don't know if any of you watched VH1's 100 best metal moments or not but they talk about a website called metalsludge.com that is QUITE INTERESTING. If you want to find out the penis size/sexual appetite of various musicians (mostly heavy metal guys), you should check it out. It's hilarious what these groupies write. It's in the section of Donna's Domain and under The Long and The Short of It. I doubt Chris would be interesting but some of you ladies might! Don't read it at work!

 em, that's great about the house! i hope it all goes smoothly. we're now waiting to hear if the seller for us is going to accept fixing all the repairs the house needs so we can go fha. i hope she says she'll do it all. wish adam and i luck!

 We are going to be homeowners!!! They countered our offer and we accepted. We'll be closing on July 16th! We take immediate posession- which is just so scary- but exciting all at the same time. There is so much work to do now in the next few weeks....but we're looking forward to it- I just wanted to share the good news!

 OK, this is me ready to be done with work today. I've already done a full days work and I just got here about an hour ago. I got up early, shaved my legs (which is not really that easy in a shower stall, but I'm remembering the good old days, so I should have it down soon), finished packing my weekend bag for my trip to my parents' house tonight, packed lunch, scooped the litter box, loaded up the car, lost my keys twice, returned my digital cable box, cashed in a lottery ticket (hey, I won $10; that's the best I've ever done; now I'm tied with what I found on the street that one time), paid my rent and finally made it into work. I'm beat! I was an hour late, but there's no way on the Green Man's earth I'm going to stay late to make it up. Thank goodness for holiday hours! I don't remember what holiday it was, but I know I worked one. Sometime. We'll say I'm suffering blood loss from the cut on the back of my leg and I have to go in for a transfusion. Yeah, I haven't really cut myself shaving in years and then today I really slipped. It was kind of fun, though. I got to walk around my house with no pants while I got ready for work. Ye gods, I love my condo! The front looks out over a parking lot and the trees have my back, so relative nudity isn't a problem. You know I'm not usually a naked person, but I'm starting to see the beauty of not wearing pants. Sometimes it's just a little too fun being me...:D

 Karissa- I appreciate the support- but he is serious on this one. Richard isn't one to apologize. And he apologized to me. Granted- I will hold him to meeting with me within the next two weeks to get something official put together. He would not have asked me to attend the managers meeting if he wasn't making this offer- they are like "top secret" or something. Also- I'm SURE that Optimedia didn't call them for a reference- because I never filled out an application for them, they only had my resume- and they have to ask permission to call for references. But even if my boss did find out about it somehow (which is unlikely)- if he wasn't going to follow through- he would have fired me instead....that's more his style. But really- the support is nice- I know you've got my back! :)

 Em, make sure you get what your boss said in writing. A verbal contract is one thing, but when it comes to your word against his, having the agreement on paper is vital. Remember when you hired on, how he told you there was room for growth and that you would be guarenteed a promotion within the first year and then he renigged? Make him write this down, or you write it down and make him sign and date it, and if he doesn't, keep applying for other jobs. I'm going to guess the ad agency called him for a reference and faced with the possibility of having to train someone else how to do your job, he got his head out of his ass and decided to honor the promises he made when he hired you. Don't let him mess you about this time. Make him put it in writing. That will also help if you get an interview somewhere else for a job you would like more. Then you could take it with you can say, see, this is what this guy is willing to pay me so now it's your turn to make an offer. Would you be taking a pay cut if you went to the ad agency?

 The nutshell version of my last 24 hours events. Planned our offer for tonights meeting with our realtor and the sellers realtor. Many questions for them- but fair offer forthcoming. After a wonderful interview at an agency that won't be able to afford me, my boss calls me into his office today to "clear the air" (his words) and tell me that he intends to make me Marketing Manager soon- no later than Oct 1 (our fiscal year) and that I'll get my full $2500 bonus as well. When I get promoted there will be a significant raise (his words again). It could happen before Oct 1- but not later. I'd be a fool to leave now. I will have a pre-approval letter to take the the meeting of realtors tonight. It should be faxed to me within hours... How exciting.

 I'm falling asleep at my computer. I just had to make a caffeine run to Barnes for a Venti chai and so far, nothing. Tell me again why we don't live in some European country where nap time is an acceptable behavior? Accident of birth? Inability to speak a foreign language? Pure unadulterated craziness? If this doesn't work, I may just be really really late tomorrow. Or I'll simply get nothing accomplished, which isn't a great stretch of the imagination, either. Staring mutely at a computer screen is what sleepy book binders do best...;)

 Seeing bad accidents is never a good thing. I meant to include in my last post about my trip TO the interview yesterday. I was on my way getting my "game face" on in my car- and right where 70 crosses over to the ramps to 465, I watched the traffic scatter in front of me- well- obviously, an accident had just occurred. But as I drove forward (I wasn't close enough to be a 'witness') and passed, I noticed a body on the road and people were then getting out of their cars and running over. Then I saw the motorcycle ahead of it. And then I saw the rider, up close. It was a horrible site. No helmet- his head was cracked open and he was shaking- I'm SURE he did not survive. I was horribly shaken when I arrived at my interview- and I still cant' get it out of my head. A semi- had switched lanes and didn't see the biker- sideswiped him as he moved. I don't think any of you ride at the moment- but if you EVER ride a motorcycle- wear a helmet. You might still get broken bones and marred skin if in an accident- but you might just save your brain... Sorry for the downer today- it was just awful though.....

 Yea for you, Em! I hope it goes through well. And that whole ASAP thing will probably be at least a little negotiable. And I understand why you want to give the guy notice, but he was such a jerkoff when you had your annual review, perhaps only giving him one week instead of two would be a little more just. I don't know. I'm awfully mean today. It's a Tuesday/Wednesday, after all. I just don't know what to do with myself. This is the one thing I hate about short weeks; it completely throws off my internal schedule. As much as I enjoyed the weekend and am happy that I'm mostly finished unpacking (I need to bring my bookcase down from my mom's house to put videos and knick-knacks on, but all the boxes are empty), there's just something about a short week that confuses my body. Ah, well. Next week will be a full five days so I'll get to complain about that when the time comes...;) Hopefully just kidding on that one...;) I'm hoping to start painting soon but I need to get my samples together and drop them off at the paint store one of these days. And I need to buy a scraper to chip the stupid Barbie border off my bedroom wall. I know, Barbie is so me...;)

 In case anyone is wondering. .. . The interview went very well. I think I totally nailed it. My only fear is that they won't be able to pay me enough. I met with the entire team for my interview- from the people who would be below me and above me- 5 in all. So we didn't talk pay, but something tells me it might only match what I'm making now- but for the move into an agency, it's totally worth it. The drawback? They want someone to start ASAP as the current person leaves on 6/15. Which means they plan to offer the job by week's end. And my boss (to whom I would give notice), leave Friday morning for the UK and won't be back until the following Friday.... Anyone ever given notice over email???? How tacky- yet, I might not have another choice...yikes!

 I won $13.75 in poker last night against the guys. I was quite proud of myself since I've never played with real money before. It was mostly luck but I won Bob's money back too!

 Super nervous. That's how I am this morning. I wish this afternoon would just hurry up and get here. The interview is something I'm looking forward to, but just can't wait to get done so I can evaluate my chances. Please, around 4pm CST- send positive thoughts my way. We had a nice weekend in PA. Avoided the sucky IN weather (hope you all did too). Rachel is getting so big- and she's such a know-it-all....can't imagine who that reminds any of you of....ah, she's like her big sis....poor girl. Hope you all had a good Memorial Day weekend!

 Mark your calendars for July 9, 2005. Kristie and Mike set the date and booked the location of their wedding. It will be around here in Chesterton. You guys are welcome to stay here if you need to and there's a Hilton right next door. Em, I asked her if she wanted to go to your shower/bachelorette thing and she said she did. For some reason though, I think Mike was sort of giving her a hard time about it. I don't know why because it's something I sort of overheard. It's also hard to understand those two because they are real quiet and don't really finish sentences when they're together. They are also dressing a like. I swear to god, the first time I thought it was a fluke. But this is at least the second or third time that they have been wearing the same type of clothes.

 Em, it's a public blog, but if we need to privatize it we can. It would probably mean changing the URL (if you're being stalked or something like that), but we can do it. Or we can just make it private and stay at this address which would mean that if anyone outside of our group is reading it already, they would probably be able to continue, but no one new would be able to look into our fishbowl. Why? What's going on?

 Karissa- question, is this blog private - as in- only our group can see- or could someone, somehow actually do a search and find us publicly?

 I love the internet. Whereas a classified ad in the Indy Star on weekdays starts at $15 A DAY- I can get a listing on sublet.com for 30 days for $15 and have access to people looking for a sublet and email them. There are like 10 people who want to move right when we do- I emailed them all...how cool is that?

 The 17th should be good for us. So far there is nothing on the July calander for us to do. I think that we should just make it a blanket celebration. We have all accomplished so much over these last few years. I can't believe that we are all turning into grown-ups!

 Well, crap. Guess I can't win for losing. How about if we all just rock in all of the big changes that we're all going through or have gone through or might possibly even consider going through within the next 18 years? What am I forgetting? ;D

 Chris...I would love to see the Spoons but I can't. I am hosting girls night out that friday. I can't move it either because that was the only weekend everyone had free. I really like the spoons. I think I'm available for July 17. Who knows (cares) about Bob. I'm still pissed at him for refusing to turn on the AC last night. I slept on the couch downstairs because it was too damn hot. What about the person who is not creating life and has already bought a house a year ago?! I want to have a party celebrating the end of Creed. No one up here would get it. I forgot to have one for the Spice Girls...

 Of course, if I were actually literate, I'd have noticed that all of the kids are singlular, not just mine. Yeah, it's Tuesday...

 Chris, I'm not sure how to react. On one hand, I'm thinking, hey, no kids for me, and if you know something I don't, I'd appreciate the heads up. I hate it when I'm preggers and don't know it. ;) On the other hand I'm thinking, hey, why does everyone else have "kids" and I have a "child"? I'm not allowed to reproduce as much as everybody else? Which then brings me back to the first hand.... Cara and I were just talking about her coming down to B-town to help me paint on 10 July, so if anyone else is interested, just let me know. I'm going to try to get the trim and ceilings all done before that so all we'll have to do will be the walls, which aren't hard, but take a while. My apoligies to those who have either brought children into the world or are counting on it in the future. I didn't mean to leave babies out of the big life changes list. I mean, I still have the one-cat barrier from being the actual cat lady, so I tend to forget about all the short people running around....

 Chris, July 17 might work for us- but we'll be semi-broke. We close on July 16, so that will just be the next day. Then again- I'd have plenty of floor space for anyone wanting to crash there, though we'll not be living there yet. I'm sure by then, we could really use a night out. Cara, are the Cunningham's having another summer party this year or anything? Oh, one more thing- Chris- my kids won't be selling the trash-bag raincoats, they'll be selling the pennies in the fountain, for the AMAZING price of $.05 each.

 I just read your post Em. Yeah, the fountain vision is coming to fruition. Very soon, my kid will be betting cara's kid that s/he can run through the fountain without getting wet. Cara's kid will say no cause s/he might catch a cold, and you're kid will be trying to sell our kids rain coats (ie. a trash bag found near the fountain). Emily Grace will then say screw the fountain and announce that she can beat all of us in checkers. Karissa's child will have all of the kids perform a quick rendition of Singin in the Rain. Theater in the park, if you will. Steph's kid will be throwing beads at everyone.

 Maybe we can have a festivus for the rest of us on July 17? I still havent met lil emily. I think the Roots are playing in Indy at someplace called the Lawn at White River(?) Cara, Spoon is gonna be in CHI on 6/25 (I think I burned that cd for you?), if you're interested I'll get tickets. Life is crazy here. My mother in law and auntie in law arrived on Friday and they are tiny, 4 foot terrors. They are fascinated by the self check out lines at the grocery store and very much enjoy free samples, even when the item (say, a box of unopened cookies) is not a free sample. I guess this is great preparation for when I'm chasing Jr. around. I'm taking them to Arlington Park on Saturday for some horse racing action...gotta bet on the ponies. We're going for dim sum on sunday morning if anyone should be interested in a big festive brunch. Guaranteed to be entertaining...

 Ah yes, but don't forget those friends who have or are also creating life. This is an amazing year in our little groups (and our individual offset groups). It's funny, but I guess in the next 5 years or so- we can almost have lived the vision of the kids playing in the fountain in Chicago. That's almost scary. Hey, I just wanted to say that I hope I haven't been too scatterbrained lately. With so much going on, I feel like everything is just whizzing by me. I'm trying to remember (consciously) to take time out and remember that everyone else has a life too. As much as I'm looking forward to the wedding, I can't wait to just get married. Things will get back to "normal" and then the remodeling starts. Anyway, I'm looking forward to a time when we can all get together, just to hang out for a day or so-

 Everybody's moving! It's weird. Half of friends are all getting married this year and the others working on buying half the houses in the world. And then there are those who are doing both, which is also amazing. I'd be more enthusiastic, but it's Tuesday. You can't ask too much of me on a Tuesday...

 John and I are going to be moving on Thursday. We are moving to the apartment place in Beech Grove that Em used to live at. It's not the side of town we wanted to be on b/c of John's commute to work but we couldn't pass us on the rent. Our new address is going to be: 4589 Kathi Dr Apt C Indianapolis, In 46237 We probably won't have a house warming party for awhile b/c we are going to be living ghetto style w/our furniture. John wants to buy new furniture for the apartment and we got rid of a lot of our old stuff or gave it to my mom so we are going to be living "Goodwill Fabulous" for a few months. But we are excited to be back on our own. Steph-We are sending good thoughts your way on house buying! Other than the move nothing else new is going on. Emily is getting bigger and bigger everyday. She cracks me up with all the funny things that she does. I am so lucky that right now John is able to provide for us and that I don't have to work. Better get back home, Grandma is babysitting.

 I was looking at my profile and it said it's been viewed 34 times! I've only looked at it 3 times myself. That's kinda weird isn't it? I compared mine to Emily's and she's only been looked at 4 times. 2 of those were mine. Have any of you looked at my profile recently?? Like a lot?

 Oh, my! Such tiny kittens! Yeah, that's a lot of work, and bottle-fed kittens have a tendency to grow up a little off-kilter. Unless you have a lot of time on your hands, tiny kittens like that are just too much work. It was bad enough when Katy came home and I had to force-feed and force-water her because of the pneumonia. At least I was able to leave her during the day and not really worry about her. Kittens that tiny need you all the time. Too bad you can't take them to work with you and make them mascots...;) I accidently ran over a bunny yesterday on my way home from work. There was an on-coming car so swerving wasn't an option. I still feel really bad, but there was nothing I could do. I just kind of wish I'd been brave enough to go back and bury it.

 Well, we had a second kitty for a day but it looks like we're going to have to take him to a shelter. The guys at work found 2 orange kittens in the transfer station today. The mother was no where to be found and they feared that she was smooshed by a garbage truck. I took the tiny (I MEAN TINY) baby home and realized (with Bob) that this kitten needs much more attention than we can give him. I think he's about 2 weeks old and barely has teeth. I still haven't seen the teeth, but Bob says they're there. We tried to give him to Pam and Larry but they don't want him either. They're going to babysit for him while we are at work and then we'll give him to this shelter tomorrow. I don't think they're the killing kind of shelter. It's kinda sad but with the constant meowing and trying to help the cat poop and Oscar vomiting, it's too much.

 Why must they make things so complicated? My company just made us fill out a form that said they could possibly monitor our emails and website usage. Needless to say, I'm not cruising the internet as much as I used to. Speaking of jobs, I'm switching positions in my company. I'm going over to the commerical side of the garbage business. It means a bigger commission but it's much more difficult to obtain it. I'll be setting up appointments for two outside sales reps and I'll get a commission off what they sell as well as what I do. One of the guys is #1 in the central region right now but can be a really demanding. The second guy is new and made $4.25 last month. He has a weird ability to ask questions in the most creepy manner. I'm taking over the position from a guy who did nothing the last month he was here and lied about it. So I'm going to have double the work load for a while. FUN! The Cunninghams are having their yearly party but we're not sure on the date yet. My whole month of July is now full.

 Em, I'm not sure companies can have internet usage reports without letting the employees know. I know I sound like a walking conspiracy, but I just have this feeling that not telling the employees that their internet usage is being monitored isn't exactly legal, which means that had he fired you, you probably could have sued him for invasion of privacy or wrongful termination or something like that. The other companies I've heard of that do that told their employees at orientation that their email may be monitored. It may not be something completely useful, but it's something to look into. Also, regardless of whether he keeps reading your lj or not, he can not use the information provided therein in any business dealings. It's something you do on your free time away from work and is therefore out of his jurisdiction. People need a place to vent about their bosses and the crap that goes on in their lives and they should be able to do that without fear of repercussions in their professional life. Was this something you were doing on breaks? Do they have times listed on their usage reports that say how long you were on which sites? If you visited the sites no more than twice a day for less than 15 minutes each visit or during your lunch hour, those can be considered breaks in which you should be able to do whatever you want. I don't know. Regardless, there's just something wrong about him looking at your personal life without your knowledge and without any warning that something like that could happen. It's good he said he doesn't want to bring it up again, but I'm betting that's at least partly because he knows he's in the wrong. On a more personal note, I'm glad your financing is getting all arranged. Haven't heard how Steph's stuff is going, but I hope everything is falling into place there, too. Steph, we need an update!

 The reason for my MIA status and other fun mentionables. . . Ok- long story short. After my review where I wasn't promoted- and highly pissed about it- I posted my vent on my livejournal. Those who aren't familiar with livejournal.com, it's basically like this, only you have your one journal- and then a list of friends who can view it, unless you privatize it. But basically, unless you specify friends only, or private- then anyone on the free internet can read it. Well- then it happened- after my interview at the ad agency, then the oh-so-timely meeting with my boss who said he now felt I was ready to promote- which prompted me to withdraw my resume from the agency. Well, a week later, after my boss's return from the UK, he called me into his office to discuss something. Well, apparently they get web usage reports- which I was unaware of. Generally speaking, I don't abuse the internet at work- but there are a few sites that I did (past tense) visit frequently. Livejournal being one of them. Well- that showed up in my history, my boss did some investigating and found my "venting" post about him and my job after the review. #1- I was mortified. Not only was I afraid I was going to lose my job, but I also felt really bad. I was extremely upset and needed to vent (hence, the journal entry)- I don't really think my boss is how I framed him to be in my journal. #2- There are personal things on there that I was now embarrassed to have my boss know. Most of it just silly stuff, but still. . . Anyway- he also knew about the agency interview- from my livejournal posts (apparently he must have found it interesting enough to read a lot of it). He said that after mentioning it- we'd never bring it up again. There was no formal write up and he says I'll still be promoted. I learned a few really big lessons here. But aside from that drama- I've just been working feverishly to get all the mortgage and closing stuff together. We have awhile- but I want to be ready. No luck yet on a subletter for our apt. We might just have to bite the bullet and break our lease and pay out the ass for it. . .. Wedding plans are coming along for the most part- I've actually got to start having alterations done on my dress soon- it's just only over 100 days away....holy cow. Anyway- still hoping that 7/17 will work for everyone- I'd love to get together....

 Congrats to Mike and Kristie! I bet Mike has a kick ass bachelor party filled with hookers and debauchery. A horse named Palooka won me $50 at the track. Goddam that's a good time. We should definitely consider an outing at Arlington Park - beer, gambling, sunshine, and oddly named horses. I need my mother in law and assorted family members out of my home. ASAP. See I reckon you're about an 8 or a 9, Maybe even 9 and a half in four beers time. That blue top shop top you've got on IS nice, Bit too much fake tan though - but yeah you score high.

 I just saw a tumbleweed roll by. Sorry I've been MIA. Seems like I havent seen/talked to you all in ages. Hopefully we can catch up in July. Maybe we can beat the shit out of a pinata. Random, but fun nonetheless. Work is beating me to a pulp. I just thought I would share that. The wife is almost 5 months now and getting bigger by the day. She's gained 10 pounds in the past 10 days. She's at that awkward stage where she's too big for her trousers but not big enough for maternity clothes. We still have no idea about a name and we are polar opposites regarding what we like. We'll find out the sex at our next dr. visit in mid july, so that should make it easier. I really wanna see the tiny Gaskin. And I really wanna kick the full sized Gaskin's ass in a) checkers and b) whatever that game was that you and CMoney cheated at over Christmas. If i were soup I'd be a nice crab bisque.

 After Emily's mishap at work, I've decided not to check the blogger at work anymore. I'm going through withdrawl but it's getting better. Speaking of work, I have no idea if I'll be changing positions or not. It seems that I do TOO good of a job in residential and they are hesitant to send me to a different area. They don't have a lot of confidence in the girl who will move up to take my place either. I'm supposed to be changing over July 1 but I think my boss has to convince the new General Manager that this change is a good thing. Who knew you could be held back for doing a good job? It pisses me off. If I did just enough not to get myself fired, then I guess I would be a shoe-in. We'll see what happens but it looks like it's impossible to move up in this damn company. Good luck with everything, Steph. I know this is kind of a stressful time.

 hey guys, just wanted to keep you updated on my house situation. the closing is moved back to july 15 because they don't think they will get the work done by the 30th. which is fine, but i have come to realize that a lot of real estate people are fucking assholes. more on that later. ;) jen, i'm glad you finally got moved into your new place! i gave kris your phone number because he wants to call you and john, i hope you don't mind. cara, congrats on moving into a better paying position. my commission was just raised from 1% to 2%, woohoo. em- i can't believe your boss. what an ass. hopefully though it's a blessing in disguise and he'll start treating you better. chris, how is liz doing? you should send some email pics of her growing belly! :) rissa- good luck with the painting!! hopefully i will be doing that to my new house in the near future also!

 So either everyone is busy or no one else is allowed on the computer. Very interesting. I should be working, too, but I thought it would be fun to come in and harass people a bit. Nothing new going on here. I'm going to go home and paint tonight, which will hopefully lead to the eventual coloriztion of my place. Ceiling are not as much fun to paint as I've made it out to be, either, but it'll be worth it in the end. :) In the mean time, don't work too hard! Have a good day!

 Cara, what made you go look at people's profiles? I never even thought about doing that before. Strange that yours should have so many hits. Perhaps yours has been public longer. I just made mine public so perhaps people will spy on me in the future...;)

 Cara-I haven't looked at your profile. I didn't even know that we had profiles on here that could be viewed. John and I are finally all moved into our place after much hassle. We were supposed to move in last Thursday 6/10 but we had problems with the apartment people and the electrcity. We got that straightened out and rescheduled our move for this Thursday 6/17. We were told to be there at 10 am and our apartment would be ready. We get there at 10:30ish (b/c frankly when are John and I ever on time) and we were told that are apartment wasn't ready yet and to come back at 1 pm so we signed the lease gave them our money and than went and had lunch and ran a few errands. We were ok with coming back b/c I needed the break since I had been up since 5:30 that morning with the baby and than trying to get John up so we could get the truck loaded. So we go back at 1 and the apartment was still not ready, we were told to come back at 3:30-4, at this point I was about to blow up but I told them that was fine as long as we could move our tv into the apartment b/c the cable man was coming bwtn 1-5. They let us do that and are now giving us free movie tickets b/c we had to wait so long to get in. Oh well, we are at least moved into our own place once again and everything feels right in the world. Chris-Happy Father's Day!

 Hello from Florida. Dog balls, my friends. Dog. Balls.

 Cunningham Party July 31st. Invitations are in the mail. If you didn't get one, it's because I couldn't find your address in the 10 minutes Pam gave me before she left on vacation. Everyone is invited. Bring loved ones.

 There is nothing really new here to report. We're getting a driveway (or the start of one) next week. We're very excited about it. We went with asphalt because it's much cheaper. We bought some fireworks and set some off tonight. Chris would have laughed at me because I kept worrying that the grass was going to catch on fire. Then I had to go in because I didn't put on bug spray and I was eaten by mosquitos. I'm now covered in bites.

 Karissa, I totally forgot to talk to you about the Jess/Nate thing- I did get your message- sorry for ignoring it. I haven't heard from her yet- but if I do, I'll make sure to let everyone know. Did they get married? Well- I'm blogging- midday- only because I'm at home in a lot of back pain. Not sure what happened- but I think it's just an aggravation of the damage from my car accident almost exactly 2 years ago. I have a chiropractor appt at 3- I hope it helps!

 I ran into Jess and Nate on Friday. They were at Target while I was at Target. It was really weird. Actually, our mutual friend, Rachel, who we met in England, saw me and stopped and we talked for a good half hour or so before Nate and Jess came to find her. We all stood and talked even longer. She's still having colitis attacks. Nate is working at the Allen County Public Library and I think Jess is at the Huntington Public, but I don't know about that for sure. I gave her Em's email address and encouraged her to email so she can get everyone's email addresses and then you can all talk to her. Not that I don't want to, but I don't think Jess wants to have anything to do with me, which I totally deserve considering how badly I treated her. But I know that you all wanted to see how she was doing so even if she doesn't email, at least you can look her up in Huntington and maybe send her a card or something. It was interesting, that's for sure. :)

 i think this is the longest no one has written.

 that's funny cara. i was thinking something similar last night because i was channel surfing and stopped on Alf. It's funny how different sitcoms were in the 80s. so wholesome and really stupid jokes. you know alf is getting his own talk show or something??

 I've been watching Flashdance on VH1 tonight and it's so funny how things have changed. When I was six, I wanted to be the main character, Alex. I thought she was beautiful, had awesome clothes and lived in a great place. I see it now and the clothes are stupid and something bothers me now about her face. Besides the ample space, who the hell would want to live in a wherehouse?! Oh well.

 Yeah, I read the blog once or twice a week but just never have time to reply. It's still a great way to keep track of what everyone is up to, though. I got back from vacation last night at midnight. Dunno what I'm doing at work today...should be home in bed resting up from my vacation! I went to Atlanta to meet up with some friends from Alabama. It's amazing how all of my stoner friends are now reputable adults with careers and families. We went canoeing in some backwoods part of Georgia (think "Deliverence" and dueling banjos), drank beer on sand bars, and then proceeded to run our canoes into trees. There were a lot of toothless people floating on old tire intertubes. Then flew down to FL to see my parents. They are nuts. Em, any luck finding info on Amici's? Does it still exist???

 Actually, I miss the blogger- but I don't have as much time to do it much right now- since I can't do it at work.

 I guess the novelty of the blogger has worn off.

 well my closing is rescheduled for tomorrow evening. if everything goes well. god i hope so! i'll let yall know.

 Morning! Not much going on here now but I'm having my second Wednesday/Tuesday in a row. I played hookie on Monday and went shopping with my friend Erin. She's decorating her house and wanted my help. We found a lot of cool stuff at Pier One and then I took her to the new Target and we wandered around there for a while. It was really nice. I got thinking about it and I haven't taken a day off, aside from university-sanctioned holidays, since Christmas. I may have called in asleep a morning or two, but I'm pretty sure I've been here every day. I put the first coat of paint in my room on Monday night. I was going to do the second coat last night but I couldn't find my second roller. I broke the first one on Monday. Who knew I was that strong? I was surprised and then annoyed as I had to use the amazing spinning head to try to finished the last 5 feet of wall. So tonight I'll have to get a new one on my way home. It's such an exciting idea that I might actually be in my bedroom by the end of the week. I don't want to jinx it, but it's still pretty cool. :) The next room I hit will be the upstairs bathroom so I can hang my new cool Tiki Time clock! Yea!

 Hey guys not much new here. I missed place my phone again so until I find it my service is suspended so you can call me on John's cell (317)698-5273. It sucks having mommy brain! Emily went to the doctor this past week and she is 12 lbs 8 oz 25 inches long. The only scary thing is that I have to take her to Riley's on Monday for an ultrasound on her left hip b/c it is still making a clicking noise when the doctor presses in. Her pediatrician doesn't think that there is anything wrong i.e. she doesn't have hip displysia but she would rather be safe than sorry and I agree. The other new thing is that John is getting a promotion to a Senior Sales Rep and will be moving to the new Carmel store. The only sucky thing about it is that is where his&nbsp;manager. Carey, that he hates is going to be the new manager. Oh well when you have to do to move up the corporate ladder.

 hey guys, finally got to close yesterday!!!&nbsp; so now i'm in debt to my eyeballs, as the commercial goes. :)&nbsp; ha ha!&nbsp; no, it feels good to own the home and be mostly done with those people now.&nbsp; i'll tell you all about it a little later.&nbsp; i still have to go sign one more paper today.&nbsp; so another half day at work.&nbsp; which sucks because i need the money, but i need the time to go get cleaning supplies and a bunch of other stuff and waiting til 5 just doesn't cut it.&nbsp; but, thanks for all the finger crossings and such. ;)&nbsp; cara, tell bob i hope he's feeling better.&nbsp; kidney stones SUCK! new address and phone: 312 S. Lopez New Orleans LA 70119 504-905-4012 (cell phone- we probably won't get a land line so this will be the new number) talk to ya'll later! :)

 Steph--how did the closing go? I kept my fingers crossed for you. What's the new address? Is it listed on here somewhere? &nbsp; My poor husband had a kidney stone yesterday and FINALLY passed it today. It's horrible to see someone in so much pain and not being able to do anything about it. I did manage to get him to the hospital. I think if we would have waited any longer, I wouldn't have been able to do it myself. He's on percocet now so he's feeling A-OK now. &nbsp; Nothing else really new since I saw you all last.

 Tinkerbell....whose the big winner? Common...whose the big winner?!

 The Check Bouncing Debacle of 2004 has nearly come to an end.&nbsp; I called my bank this morning to find out if I had bounced any checks because of her idiocy and it turns out, no!&nbsp; Who is the luckiest girl in the world?&nbsp; I'M the luckiest girl in the world!&nbsp; Now I just need to get her check and deposit it and I'm going to be golden.&nbsp; More or less. :)

 Hiring movers are the best thing to do. I'm going to insist we do that next time. Sorry to cut this short..I sneezed and hurt myself.

 movers coming tomorrow evening.&nbsp; cleaning apartment saturday (more cleaning, i'm cleaned out).&nbsp; i forgot what it's like to clean a big house.&nbsp; there's so much wall space!&nbsp; 17 ft ceilings.&nbsp; taking carpet out of the front 2 rooms tomorrow- wood floors underneath. :)&nbsp; sunday- rest.&nbsp;

 hopefully we can get fully moved this friday so we can clean our apartment on saturday.&nbsp; it is exciting.&nbsp; the house is so dirty though.&nbsp; the tenants who lived in it before didn't clean at all when they lived there.&nbsp; we have a lot of hispanic and black neighbors and a few white people live around there too.&nbsp; the hispanics don't speak much english, but our other neighbors have been coming up to us and telling us they are glad to see us move in.&nbsp; mid city used to be really great then it got bad and now more white people are moving back in and the black people like it because they are telling us they think it will make the neighborhood better, being more mixed like that.&nbsp; everyone is really nice and they also have a neighborhood watch there.&nbsp; there's a corner grocery store half a block away on either side and a laundry mat we can walk to.&nbsp; you can see the central business district buildings from the corner also, which is cool. :)&nbsp; i'm going to take pictures of the house this week and email them. cara-my cat bites me all the time.&nbsp; she won't bite adam anymore because he would throw her across the room (didn't hurt her, but it scared the shit out of her).&nbsp; but she still plays with him.&nbsp; she just has to learn i guess.&nbsp; and she's a kitten so i think she will grow out of it.&nbsp; she also likes to hide and jump out at me and grab my legs.&nbsp; jen-i hope you find your phone.&nbsp; i know how annoying that can be when you can't remember where shit is.&nbsp; i better get back to work.&nbsp; blah.

 Congratulations Steph! When is the big move? I know it's exciting! Nothing all that new here. Bob has recovered from his kidney stone and is now suffering from a slight cold. He loves to tell the story of his trip to the emergency room. (I think his friends are getting tired of hearing it, actually.) We took Oscar to the vet and he now weighs 12 lbs. We also have him on hormones because the vet thinks he's too masculine and that's why he's biting so much.&nbsp; I already regret giving it to him because I swear he's different after a few days. I didn't want to change him completely! Plus I'm afraid that I'll overdose him on pills because I can't remember if I gave him one this morning or not. It's like taking stupid birth control all over again! We had another "great" experience with JR's girlfriend on Saturday night playing poker. She got so drunk and obnoxious that we had to leave.&nbsp; I had the pleasure of being the only sober one there. I was so sick of telling her what she had to bet and when it was her turn. I had to leave before she caught me rolling my eyes. That girl could beat the shit out of me...and pretty much everyone else who was there. You'll probably see her on Saturday.&nbsp; Let's hope she behaves.

 CONGRATULATIONS!!! that's great news, jen. sounds like it turned out to be a pretty good week for ya! :) i know that i told you girls my new address, but now since there are technically 3-units there mine is A. so it's really 312 s. lopez st., #A talk to you soon!

 Ok! So here is the news that most of you saw go down last saturday at the Cunningham party.......I'm a gettin' hitched!!! John finally did it he proposed to me! Neither one of us can remember what he said to me but it was perfect and of course I said yes!

 It's finally official. Brian emailed me today and I finally quit being a chicken-sh*t and told him that it's over. I told him that I accept my own part of my misery but I also made sure to tell him that he's the one who did the leaving, not me. I don't want him out there thinking that girls always leave him and I'm just one in the crowd who hurt him. If I can take responsibility for my actions and poor decisions, he has to, too. I offered him something better and he turned it down and then pretty much stopped talking to me with the exception of the monthly email of guilt, and if that's not one way to leave someone, I don't know what is. If he really loved me or really missed me he would have tried harder to keep me, but he didn't. I don't need him to make me feel bad; I can do it myself when the situation calls for it, which is something I try to avoid. What I need is someone who wants to try to make me happy, something else I can do for myself when the situation calls for it, which it always does. It's hard to decide you deserve to be happy, but if you can find the strength to do it, things can't help but look up, right? If I can take responsibility for my misery I can take responsibility for my happiness, too. That's why I bought a house and moved. It's me taking control of my life and making an effort to make myself happy. I can only fix me, after all.

 Hope you are having a good day, bride-to-be!!

 HAPPY BIRTHDAY JEN!!!!!
