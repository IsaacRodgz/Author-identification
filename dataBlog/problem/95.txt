 urlLink News [Nota Bene: I do this to prove that I'm working. So far, 21 pages not counting title pages and appendices.] Background The past century in America saw tremendous growth in population in urban areas. This was due not only to an influx in immigration in these decades, but also from the diminishing role of farm communities and rural areas in this country. Where the majority of people lived on rural lands in the first half of the last century, those roles reversed since World War II. Interestingly, the idea of the American school also went the way of the city. Instead of stereotypical visions of one-room schoolhouses on the prairies, today’s modern American school is usually thought of as an immense superstructure of media centers, athletic fields, and numerous other amenities. In most cases there have been many benefits towards the super-school model. Students are able to access a wider variety of resources to meet their particular needs and interests. Facilities can accommodate larger groups of people, and therefore become regional centers of influence much like a college campus. There are downsides, however. Recent events in Colombine and other large schools where shootings have taken place have had society and those in the field of education look at ways these super-schools are not working successfully. Where some critics find these schools to be full of opportunity, others see students become faceless cogs in a greater, impersonal educational machine. More importantly, larger schools are usually found in suburban areas where an adequate tax base and a large student body within a reasonable distance from the schools can be found. Such large institutions thrive in the suburbs, where a mostly homogeneous community is self-supportive. In rural areas, however, incomes are lower as well as population density and availability of resources. Large, consolidated schools exist in rural areas much in the same way as they do in suburban or urban areas, yet the costs of operation are much higher due to the distances covered by transportation programs (sometimes several hundred square miles), a greater dependence on state or federal programs (such as Head Start and the school breakfast program for poorer families), and the need for constant technological revamping. Statement of Problem Since urban and rural areas have both dealt with high amounts of poverty, legislators, school boards, and educational theorists have generally attempted to solve rural problems with urban ones, believing that urban poverty is a greater priority and assuming that what works in the city will aid the country as well. A closer look at evidence, however, shows that this is not the case. In many instances the urban solutions proposed by government agencies are not useful in rural areas because the infrastructure simply does not exist. Nevertheless, rural students continue to achieve satisfactory scores on measure evaluations. It may be possible, then, to derive certain qualities from rural schools that may not only be exploited for the poor rural students, but can also be studied for use in poor metropolitan districts as well. The community school, directly evolved from the one-room schoolhouse of days past, had a limited but solid record of accomplishment. Some rural schools have switched back to smaller school systems, not to mention a very small number of urban schools as experiments. What, if any, correlation is there between a sense of community in a school district and the definition of that community? Is a community determined by the resources it shares? Historically, what was the influence of community in rural schools? Need, Purpose, and Significance of Study As previously indicated, rural schools were often treated as urban schools during reform periods in terms of programs and theories used, with varying degrees of success. In order to be more effective educationally, low-income rural school districts were not considered from a community perspective but primarily by an economic or political one. Rural communities as well had particular needs that required discussion and action, and the local school district needed viewing from the context of its surrounding environment. It was also important to reunify and strengthen the bonds between the school and the community. The past several decades have stressed student and parent involvement as a means of development. Physically, however, large school districts have actually pulled education as far from the community foundation as possible. Simultaneously, the rural community shrunk as a whole, losing parts of its own infrastructure as industries, jobs, and people moved towards the city. If students in rural areas were being trained using urban curricula, not only did they risk growing up unprepared to work around their own homes but their education forced them to move towards metropolitan areas as well, contributing to the decline of American rural communities. A separate need also had to be addressed during this investigation: that of pervasive and often incorrect stereotypes concerning rural and urban living and education standards. Oftentimes, it was the urban schools that were thought of as poorest in the nation, usually minority students living in inner-city ghettos or housing projects. Society believed that poverty is primarily urban, and that most government aid in education went to help those city students. In actuality many of the poorest students were white, and a large percentage of state and federal aid went towards the development poor rural areas. In the 1920s era researched for this project, state governments earmarked inordinate sums of money for rural schools to quickly instigate modernization programs, often with the belief that rural areas had to catch up with more populous districts. Scope and Limitations The following project was a qualitative, historiographical study concerning a rural school, its phases of growth, and how elements participating in the school's development coped with changes in population and redefinitions of the school as an important fixture in the community over the twentieth century. Much of the focus was on the growth of rural districts and reallocation of funds and resources to areas that did not have the full capability to supply all students with necessary faculty or materials. Special attention was taken to outline debates over shared resources or utilization of regional services and non-profit organizations. The study examined rural educational services both inside and outside the jurisdiction of Brockport, New York school districts during a transitional phase from one-room schoolhouses to a centralized school building. This was done through the use of historical study that examined the more obvious phases of rural demographics over the last century. Generally, changes in population led to changes in school systems: greater populations pushed forced many students out of increasingly crowded, one-room schoolhouses, and burgeoning towns built larger facilities in anticipation of expanding generations. Less superficially, the interactions between school youth programs, parent organizations, government entities and local media outlets on the school would gradually change over time. It was the researcher’s assumption that historical traits and themes existed concerning school-community interdependence in rural areas that may be discovered through an analysis of original source materials. Documents concerning specific schools were found in local education records and held by town historical societies. Over time, local newspapers painted a picture of what most defined the surrounding community and kept an excellent record of school events as well as the participation level of the citizenry pertaining to school issues. Finally, the school districts considered was one described as “rural” by the state Department of Education, either by precedent such as the meting of funds or by designation on state-sponsored reports. In order to ensure the subject studied (the soon-consolidated Brockport school system) was not unique; the school chosen had to exist in a greater area largely settled simultaneously throughout. Specifically, former Holland Land Company holdings made up the rural parts of what is Monroe County today. The study focused on the twentieth century as rural towns changed from frontier settlements to more permanent community infrastructures.

 It appears that only a small rotating cast of supporters and journalists put The Little Red Schoolhouse together, with diminishing returns. Begun in 1927, the eight-page monthly eventually became a four-page monthly, then an eight-page bimonthly, and then quit in 1935. Though many periodicals shut down with the onset of the depression, the fact that several of the dozen or so persons running the paper died during its run could also explain the mailing's deterioration. Herbert Winslow Collingwood, who spent four decades editing the farmer advocate paper the Rural New Yorker, founded the New York State Rural School Improvement Society and organized some 1500 school district meetings protesting legislative actions. The first publication of The Little Red Schoolhouse printed his eulogy. The last issue, on October 1935, printed the eulogy of treasurer Carrie D. Converse. This fact could also symbolize the cause of one-room schoolhouses in Brockport: aged, passing away slowly and without replacement. Devendorf was not only the president of the RSIS but managing editor of Schoolhouse; secretary Ostrander is the only other person listed on the masthead. The Hon Fredd H. Dunham of Batavia, who legally incorporated the RSIS, counted himself as a member of the organization. He wrote several articles demonstrating how rural districts could licitly submit donations to the group, even writing form letters for school boards. The dubious nature of such donations continued throughout the paper's run but the RSIS found no difference between village school boards using tax moneys for their aims and rural advocacy groups doing the same thing. The first issue emphasized rural Brockport's minority struggle for district autonomy, but by 1935 the fight was futile. Lost lawsuits led to closed classrooms buildings. Public opposition quieted. The paper often used repetitive, sloganeering diction, rife with rambling, unedited sentences. It required donations to stay afloat, begging that rural schools put those donations into their budgets. Simultaneously, they argued against the higher taxes that would arise as a result of consolidation and the salaries of school boards. Articles were inflammatory and propagandistic. One would decry rural taxes paying for central schools while another would complain that country schools had to be funded solely by rural taxpayers. Columnists described school superintendents as Czarist dictators, the State Department of Education as despotic, and the state judicial system an open supporter of tyranny and despised dictators. When democratic elections and referendums were held, they were fraudulent. Town officials performed a litany of conduct errors at each public meeting. And in each case, a Rural School Improvement Society member witnessed each offense for Schoolhouse readers, promising speedy legal repercussions with readers' continued support. The Rural School Improvement Society made Brockport's consolidation the centerpiece of its premiere issue in November 1927, months after the district-wide vote allowed the action. "The village of Brockport with the aid of District Superintendent Fred W. Hill has apparently forced consolidation," the page-long article summated. It explained that fifteen of the *eighteen* districts in the plan voted against the plan by a 52-530 margin. The meeting on 19 July, held on the Normal School grounds, showed favoritism towards the villagers through its location alone. Supt. Hill failed even to recognize John H. White, the rural nominee for chairman, and held a vote for village candidate Herbert W. Bramley instead. According to Schoolhouse the rural folk then elected a rural clerk for the meeting in retaliation. The author found rural voters frustrated, angry to the point of hampering procedures, and segregating themselves to the eastern side of the hall, opposite the villagers. Brockport held the consolidation vote after the meeting, with both village people and townspeople in attendance. Beyond the location of the polling, however, the article also debated against allowing voters who did not attend the meeting to participate. Bramley allowed polls to remain open until 9 p.m., much to the chagrin of the RSIS. Doing so gave village store clerks an unfair advantage by letting them close their shops at a regular time and still arrive for the vote. The 968 to 386 tally supposedly resulted from this unfair advantage given to the villagers by a villager, who would not permit the recording of any official complaint concerning the process. Within several paragraphs The Little Red Schoolhouse offered several contradicting arguments to account for their side's poor showing. Though its opening paragraph stated that 530 voters in fifteen districts opposed the plan and only fifty-two supported centralization they presented no explanation of independent data-gathering. The possibility existed that such a larger number of rural voters disliked consolidation but having only fifty-two in favor could not explain how almost one thousand persons chose in the affirmative in a place as small as Sweden, New York. Holding a vote in the Normal School benefited all voters as it was immediately after a debate on the subject. Farmers who did not spend much time in the village could have participated in the meeting, checked firsthand the state of the current facilities, and recorded a vote in just one visit. By keeping the polls open until the set time at night Bramley not only gave more villagers the chance to take part in the vote but farmers, who might not have had the opportunity for the meeting and required extra time to make it to the village. The article's account also notes a well-attended, active body of rural congregants; a meeting hall already half-filled with such a group could only advance their cause. The Normal School polls in that place and that time represented the full spectrum of opinion concerning Brockport consolidation. The Little Red Schoolhouse was livid, and they appealed the vote immediately. They mentioned a town clerk who said notices were not posted in his office. Nevertheless, "a crowd of interested people gathered at the Normal Hall." A small number of students preferred to remain in schools in such towns as Spencerport, Bergen, and Holley, and somehow those long trips outside of town were more convenient travel than their parents' trip to the village voting booth. Without a hint of irony the author characterized those villages as "community centers of the various districts . . . capable of maintaining well appointed, efficient schools, and are desirous and competent of doing so." Still, the organization voiced many fears of the anti-consolidation farmers. Centralization of schools meant a loss of power within each community. The promises of upkeep of Little Red Schoolhouses for elementary students, though not a part of the high school conversation, consistently crept into meetings. The RSIS named the paper such to evoke that spirit of rural independence, and to push nostalgia for their adult members. Each issue featured a picturesque snapshot of such a building submitted by subscribers, often schoolteachers who sent in their yearly class photo. Whether by coincidence or premeditation, the third issue highlighted nearby District Number Nine of Pavilion, just a few short miles from Sweden. "Needless to say," read the four paragraph caption on page 1, "the people of the district are proud of their 'Red Schoolhouse' and do not wish the district consolidated.'" Rural voters were always outnumbered, and their independence led them to distrust outsiders and outside ideas. The state legislature and department of education determined reform in central schools; by simply not controlling the meetings, some rural parents must have felt voiceless after years of case-by-case decisions about school policy made between themselves and their neighbors. Suggesting the outsider officials trade their positions at the Normal Hall for work at Tammany Hall, the RSIS reiterated their belief in multi-district polling and their disbelief in the effectiveness of New York's consolidation protocols. "HOME RULE FOR THE RURAL DISTRICTS" became the cry for the few anti-consolidation activists inside the rural minority. Addressing the necessity of such a group, the paper made clear its belief and mission: Had this organization been functioning ten years ago the deplorable condition which exists today in many sections of the state would never have come to pass. The administration of the school affairs in district after district has literally been stolen from the country people by some nearby village which sufficient votes to do it with, or through the connivance of some District Superintendent . . . . The nonprofit RSIS fought in Brockport, New York the same way they fought in Madrid, Chautauqua County, West Chazy, Marion, Williamsville, and dozens more towns: organizing local meetings, writing about 20,000 letters a year, and holding up all possible legislative actions in court. Section 128 of the Education Law, which the RSIS said gave school officials such as superintendents "authority to secretly force consolidation", and Article 6-B, that required majority elections for centralization be held instead of district by district polling, had to be altered or deleted. They garnered support from local chapters of the Grange, who made school consolidation an issue of daylong discussion at an annual convention in Jamestown. One Schoolhouse article mentioned a rural Brockport resident who tried to meet with Department of Education Commissioner Graves about the upcoming consolidation. Bound by law, the Commissioner was unable to speak on the subject because he would soon judge the case. The author found it interesting that the rural voter could be brushed aside while someone named "P. A. B." could submit information that "practically" said consolidation would take place in a Brockport Republic and Democrat letter to the editor. Schoolhouse openly supposed the Commissioner discriminated against the rural resident while running his mouth to whomever else he chose. Sarcastically naming the insider "Poor and Blind" the paper charged "He [P. A. B.] evidently has had a thorough discussion of the case with some representative of the office of the Commissioner, to be able to print this advance information." What the periodical failed to understand after many months of meetings and correspondence village of Brockport and its only newspaper was that P. A. B. stood for P. A. Blossom, former editor of the Republic and Democrat and the elected president of the district school board for well over a year. Whatever "advance information" P. A. B. had--of which the Schoolhouse article remarkably did not specify--would have been nothing more than a well-informed opinion predicting a judgment upholding the landslide vote of 1927. Just as the Commissioner "practically" broke the law that April, in August he "virtually" ignored Brockport farmers appeal when it was rejected. A further injunction continued to prevent building until a hearing in February 1929. Schoolhouse referred to "numerous witnesses [of the hearing], who testified as to the illegality of the meeting at which the vote was taken." The paper printed no names to support the statement except for that of A. D. Ostrander. The appeal lost again in the courts, but The Little Red Schoolhouse reminded its readers "the Court merely decided that bonds might be sold and ignored the constitutional as well as the other important points brought up in this case" and promised to appeal yet again. On 16 October another hearing was held in the Court of Appeals; it failed again. Judges interviewed the defense for the entire hearing while Ernest E. Cole, then Commission of the Department of Education, did not speak but "framed what the writer calls a 'wry' smile."

 The most universal and accessible resources of Brockport's history must be those of its newspapers. The Brockport Republic, formed in 1857, lasted until the 1970s. Horatio Beach and his son Lorenzo, save for one year by Nellie Beach ran the paper from its inception to 1899. The Blossom family members, also local, became editors and publishers for several decades more. Simultaneous publications, mostly published as local advertising tools and not news sources, lasted for several years at a time. The major exception was the Brockport Democrat, published by a P. J. Willson of Medina for most of its run. The Brockport Republic knew much about the process of consolidation, merging with local competitor Brockport Democrat on 25 June, 1925. As the name suggests, the new Brockport Republic and Democrat attempted to consider the entire political spectrum, showing favoritism for the locality more than any other entity. On its very first issue under the consolidation, however, the newspaper covered the biggest local issue since the building of the Erie Canal. The headline that day read, "SERIOUS PHASE IN SCHOOL AFFAIRS: HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS SET ADRIFT BY STATE DEPT. OF EDUCATION." Editors Blossom would soon insert their own opinions of the controversial matter into their paper. Though alternative views were also presented over the course of several years, editors' anger seemed reserved only for those outsiders who proposed to thrust themselves into public discourse. For many years the citizens of Brockport were educationally privileged. Due to the need for an area Normal School and the earlier failure of a Baptist College in the village, the state chose to settle the new school in Brockport's large, pre-existing facilities. The state designated leftover room, such as the ground floor, for the town's high school. Over time both schools grew considerably. By 1925 the former Brockport Collegiate Institute building failed to provide adequate space. Enrollment in 1926 would reach 235 persons for the high school and 185 in the Normal department; both were the highest attendance rates in their schools' history. It should be mentioned that the Normal School always considered the high school a guest in their building; a verbal agreement between state and village had, since the schools' inception, left high school funding and administration up to the state. Such an arrangement was unique in New York. Other state Normal Schools, such as Geneseo, New Paltz, Plattzburg and Potsdam, held similar Normal/high school arrangements, usually for the benefit of future teachers requiring a place to learn their trade. Those crowded schools were under written contracts that the state would not renew. As the Normal School expanded, the expulsion of the high school dangled inevitably over the heads of Brockport residents. Citizens needed to make several quick decisions about the fate of their high school. For one, they officially did not have a school; the state "donated" all education up to that point. Would the people support the building of a new high school? Would they pay taxes for such an expensive endeavor? The village was ill-prepared to lose their school as much as the town was to create a new one. With a high school then under taxpayer expense, who exactly made up the taxpayer base? Grammar school graduates from neighboring towns and villages also took part in the state-funded high school, albeit on a case-by-case basis. Excepting those who would graduate in the next year (only 25 percent of the student body) the remaining majority had to return to those schools. Some families of the farthest and most rural students often preferred to place their children in nearby one- or two-room schoolhouses. If districts remained the same, parents might circumvent any newly passed Brockport tax raises. In the same way, families who had nothing to do with Brockport or its high school might scoff at the consolidation of surrounding districts to increase the town's tax base. Within several years residents would debate not only taxes and public education, but on the definition of their community. Within a week, District Superintendent Fred Hill would suggest the "community" include the whole of Sweden (the town which Brockport was located), all of Clarkson town, and parts of Parma and Adams Basin. The "absolute order abolishing the High School," Blossom wrote, came "like a thunderbolt on the people of Brockport." Two months after the original edict, in August the state allowed most high school students one final year in the Normal School building, halving the number of previously earned credits needed to remain enrolled. Shortly afterward, all local students in Sweden and Clarkson's School District Number Nine would remain admitted, as well as students whose "exclusion would work a real hardship." Amongst articles about fairs and picnics, however, the Republic-Democrat described emotions over schooling as "the uneasiness and anxiety which has prevailed among residents and the surrounding country," and the newer decision as leaving Brockport "temporarily relieved of a serious situation." This local media outlet treated the school issue as an emergency, recommending students continue to find other schools to enroll in to minimize future scholastic conflicts. On 3 December 1925, the Brockport Republic-Democrat ran a notice concerning the high school question written and signed by a committee of the Retail Merchants Council of Brockport. The result of a months-long study, the committee discussed the applicable Central Rural School Law which offered numerous incentives to localities that consolidated small districts. Detailing state-paid teacher quotas, schoolhouse preservation plans, and budgetary concerns, the authors described the law's implementation in Brockport as "logical" and "ideal." The same article emphasized supposed tax savings for the public and the possibility of three times more public money flowing into the vicinity as with the current high/Normal plan. The greatest detractors to school consolidation would criticize the organization of merchants as inherently anti-rural and pro-village. By this point the necessity of a new school seemed a foregone conclusion. The possibility of rising taxes became the predominant issue for local residents, and an urgent one as well: the state cut salaries for eight teachers in anticipation of the schools' split, and those teachers threatened to leave. Superintendent Hill and Normal School President Dr. A. C. Thompson held several community meetings to answer community concerns. "It's your duty to attend this meeting and acquaint yourself with the facts," pressed the Brockport Republic-Democrat on 25 February 1926. "It's your last chance." Of the eight main questions listed by the paper as "most often asked," four inquired about budget financing. During one March 1926 meeting a Mr. D. Boyd Devendorf, president of the New York Rural School Improvement Society, attended at the request of a rural district. In fact, Hill moved the meeting to Clarkson so Devendorf's rural audience would not have to travel too far. Blossom's report of the meeting showed readers not only how Blossom perceived the anti-consolidation Devendorf, but began to expose how the informed Blossom leaned ever closer to the state's point of view. "Devendorf [sic]. . . hits at terms of consolidation law, but dodges issue at hand," the editor summarized in a subheading. The executive secretary portrayed in the article failed to speak specifically about the Brockport situation but instead condemned the whole of New York consolidation rulings. As the guest speaker would not comment on particulars, Supt. Hill rebutted many of Devendorf's broad generalizations concerning consolidation--it would make tax rates unbearable, the quality of student education would decline--with numbers that stated quite the opposite. The Brockport Republic-Democrat described Hill as so flustered with the speaker's hot air that "Mr. Hill finally said to him: 'Mr. Devendorf [sic], I assume you are interested in the education of these children. ARE YOU?' and Mr. Diefendorf hemmed and hawed." Devendorf would later read the Republic article and write an angry response to the paper. Printed in its entirety, Devendorf noted several occasions during said meeting where he stated "a very definite plan:" to allow individual rural districts to ratify consolidation instead of having the entire proposed district accept or decline the plan by simple popular vote. Anything less would be unjust and undemocratic. Though Sup. Steele of Clarkson, who hosted the meeting, and Hill both allowed Devendorf a period for rebuttal, Devendorf claimed Hill "was allowed to have his way." Blaming the state legislature for reforms that left rural areas behind, the president attempted to "make it plain" in his letter that the consolidation issue had "been imposed" upon unknowing rural residents. Downsides pertaining to Brockport were indirectly mentioned, though he reminded the editor of newly consolidated Trumansburg, where some students had to walk six miles to class. In any case, editor Blossom, in his last few months on the job, seemed to take Devendorf's words personally and galvanized him towards a pro-consolidation bent. Several elements, general as they were, found sympathy with those in outlying Clarkson and Sweden. If a new school would be built, what would happen to the current neighborhood schools? Transportation--especially in winter--was always a concern. Most importantly, however, was independence. A theme running throughout the "School Wars," whether between Blossom and Devendorf or the villagers and rural folk, concerned the refusal of any one side to take orders from another. Citizens inside and outside the village overwhelmingly approved a new high school, but some residents proposed a visit from Devendorf apparently to address questions about the loss of old schools and new taxes, not the new school. One day after the publication of Devendorf's letter, the Brockport Republic-Democrat published a Special Edition: Supt. Hill, with the unanimous consent of trustees from all school districts, agreed to a singular, popular vote over individual district majorities. "The greatest good of the greatest number," Devendorf quoted of the gathering, chaired not by Hill but the unanimously picked John H. White of Sweden. "The meeting adjourned with everybody in good humor and we sincerely hope that future discussions will all tent toward approval of the proposed consolidation." Suffering from a bout of the flu, Blossom waited two weeks to publish a reply to Devendorf in a column subtitled "READ THE TRUTH." Sarcastically the editor thanked Devendorf for correcting his position and the correct spelling of his name. Blossom's research on Trumansburg, however, revealed the rest of the president's letter to be out of context. As the original reply complained of the usurpation of rural power by the village, Trumansburg was a poor example because a three to two majority of trustees came from rural districts, picked via popular election. Long walking distances or not they had wholeheartedly supported consolidation, including approval of a $300,000 building when studies suggested a minimum $175,000 investment. Blossom further criticized the plan of individual referendums, suggesting that richer, larger landowners could use the sparse populations in their districts to vote against consolidation and selfishly preserve their property tax rates: "It [individual district approvals] would give a district which would look like a checker board and be unfair to everybody." In order to demonstrate his concern for the rural class, Blossom inserted for the first time "a bit of personal history" into the Brockport Republic-Democrat: "For Mr. Devendorf's information and those opposing consolidation we want to say that we were born on a farm, now have a joint interest in two farms, and all our sympathies, if the farmers were being manhandled, would be with them." Here read the words of not only a village newspaperman, but an investing farmer willing to risk profits for the sake of public education. They were also the last words P. A. Blossom ever published on the subject. Son E. M. Blossom took the reins of the publication that July. Father Blossom's name often graced the pages of the Brockport Republic-Democrat, however. In the 15 July issue he could be found getting elected chairman of the Sweden school committee to switch that district from a rural school to a consolidated, Union Free district. The next February, an all-inclusive district committee elected P. A. Blossom chairman of their transition team. Immediately after the vote he was officially elected to the new central district's first school board and one week after that, its president. Three of the five board members came from rural parts of the district. E. M. Blossom showed an obvious bias from the beginning, publishing several long editorials supporting consolidation, promoting the benefits of rural school modernization, and defaming the Rural School Improvement Society. A petition pushing for an early vote on consolidation circulated on the front page. Proponents of the plan were described as "farsighted and public spirited residents of the community" while the RSIS had "yet, as far as we can learn, ever done a constructive thing for the improvement of the schools which they claim to represent." The visiting A. D. Ostrander, the actual RSIS secretary and soon publisher of the RSIS paper The Little Red Schoolhouse was by all accounts of the Republic-Democrat shamed out of a town meeting when one congregant in the large crowd read one of his "letters to the editor" from another town paper contradicting the talking points of his speech. "It is inconceivable," Blossom opined less than a week before the vote, "how anyone who has the interests of our children at heart, can vote against the proposition." The vote to consolidate pass in a landslide: 968 to 386. Further immediate study of the voting record also proved that approval was not a "steal," as Ostrander described, for without the participation of village voters the central school plan would still have gained a majority vote. Nevertheless, the RSIS would fight in the courts what it could not win in the voting booths. Within weeks the organization filed papers accusing the election of being illegal, thereby preventing any decisions to be made concerning site selection and construction. It would be well into the next decade before Brockport could build their desperately desired high school.

 urlLink TheOmahaChannel.com This whole gay marriage amendment thing smells like theocracy. And it's being pushed by a leader who smells like monarchy. As much fun as Europe was back in the days when Kings tried to be Pope, I'd like to move on to more inclusive administration. Why don't we nip it in the bud? Instead of a "no gays settling down" rule, let's amend the Constitution to ban presidents from having their siblings, offspring, spouses, cousins or any blood relations within two degrees of separation from taking their place. It would help ensure that our future leaders be of talent, not dynasty, and it could have gotten McCain elected instead. This is not to say, for example, that John Adams and son were bad leaders, but these Bushes and Clintons are getting out of hand. I could argue that back in Adams' time there were a dozen equally acceptable substitutes and that the modern era faces a dearth of them. What I am saying is that political parties now go by name recognition and electability instead of skill. Consider the situation in India, where a Gandhi chose not to rule and gave the country a panic attack. Should we say that out of one billion people there is one family to rule them all? Of course not. Then why JEB and Hillary in 2012?

 urlLink Cape Times I attempted to do a couple errands and end up at UB to FORCE myself to write my thesis. Did it work, you may ask? Well, I'm blogging, aren't I? A whole afternoon down the hole.

 urlLink Suitcase Yields Possible Beatles Trove Horribly wack. Mr. Jerry has decreed that even though I cleaned out the garage for the purposes of rockin' real hard, he doesn't want to hear it from the second floor. In a cold Footloose fashion, he has ordered the drums out and banned rocking (and visitors) from the garage that he himself wouldn't visit (or clean) a week ago. This is a rockblock of the highest proportions. Maybe I can use my cleaning efforts as a bargaining chip to get his snoring Libyan arse off our couch and into his bedroom, where he belongs.

 urlLink Last night I cleaned out *part* of the garage to clear some band rehearsal space. This is actually Day 3. Before I had started much of the building was inaccessible.&nbsp; urlLink

 urlLink Before: the entrance, with the Sink of Mystery.&nbsp; urlLink

 urlLink This is a cream separator, used on small dairy farms. I saw a similar one in a museum dated 1938.&nbsp; urlLink

 urlLink Later on I found twelve more hubcaps and ten spare tires.&nbsp; urlLink

 urlLink I wrote this between 2nd to 4th grade, proving I've been trying to clean the house since the late eighties.&nbsp; urlLink

 urlLink The underside of the sink, crushed under the weight of garbage and rot.&nbsp; urlLink

 urlLink I hope you can read that; hindsight is hilarious.&nbsp; urlLink

 urlLink Can you find all the coffee urns in this picture? (There's one in the brown box, too.) By the end of the night I'd found ten.&nbsp; urlLink

 urlLink I bought dust masks because my last two attempts in the garage made me sick. It worked, but it got uncomfortable after 9 hours.&nbsp; urlLink

 urlLink This was under one of the three refridgerators. It'd been there so long it was filled with dead maggots, and the tail and spine peeled off like the thread on a pair of pants.&nbsp; urlLink

 urlLink (medium res) I HAVE that keyboard! It's 5:30 in the morning. I've been cleaning my garage since 8 PM. After 3 sessions like that, I'm starting to make progress . And I've got pic after boring pic; you'll see them later this weekend. Tonight I found 10 coffee pots, an 8-foot hand reaper (like the Grim Reaper uses, and the replacement blades), *about* 9 lawnmowers, 20 hubcaps, 8 expired license plates, 3 sleds, and a whole bunch of other crap that just had to go. CDs today: Ween, "Paintin' the Town Brown" [2 discs] Led Zeppelin, "Physical Graffiti" [2 discs] "Led Zeppelin I" "In Through The Out Door" Natalie Imbrugia, "Left Of The Middle" "White Lilies Island" "B-Sides" Cassettes today (discovered in a box): Oldies 104, "Buffalo Bills Boogie," 1991 and 1992 seasons.

 urlLink Rock Paper Saddam After getting my new University of Buffalo ID card I was able to partake in a few cheap-to-free software upgrades, including Microsoft Office and a $1.40 copy of XP Professional. Apparently upgrading from Home to Pro can be hampered--maniacally--with newer DirectX and Media Player 9 upgrades. The OS will install but be unverifiable, and I was unable even to log on to my own account. Going to Safe Mode for System Restore doesn't work because System Restore didn't install either. Good Buddy Joe, after a long night of hot dog fellowship and rocking with Diamond Dave Hill, was more than helpful finding fixes online with his laptop well into the night. By 1:30 in the morning I was able to reinstall enough of the OS to--at the very least--boot. I drove home only to find that it would not accept my wireless internet connection. I plugged in an went ahead anyway, hoping that one of the 49 Windows Updates I needed would solve the problem. Something must have happened with either those or my third attempt at Service Pack 1 because I finally got my wireless back at 5:30 AM. This morning I woke up and it "allowed" me to put in Office Pro, which was all I really wanted to do in the first place. Now the only problems I have are a help window that opens for no real reason at startup (which doesn't connect to the site) and a warning box at each boot that says "Installation Failed." But everything else runs okay. Thank you again, Microsoft. None of your Operating Systems have crashed since Windows 98, and your technical help is far superior to the message boards that criticize you. The past 24 hours have been gravy.

 urlLink Need A Loan??!! Transferring all old blogs to Blogspot took several hours of dedication. My desire to skim my posts from the past two years hampered the effort. I did notice some themes, however. My infatuation with Natalie Imbruglia's music, embarrassingly, is one of them. It also reminded me that it's been a few months since I've listened to her albums and I should dig them out again. Then--just now--it made me think about the number of times I've written about Natalie Imbruglia on the internet. I Googled " urlLink Schrock Imbruglia " and came up with 600 entries. Maybe three of them are mine, but now you understand the intertwinificationatory relationship our DNA-- OUR VERY BEING --has. I also wrote a lot of posts about Subway Sandwiches. That doesn't make sense at all. I also found out urlLink Kate Schrock is a nationally known musical artist of the singer/songwriter variety. Check out urlLink pics of me if I were a woman and decent musician living in Maine. Hey, she reads the New York Times too!

 urlLink Me at a Teaching Job Interview Front page news in Brockport, New York (15 September 1927): HOBOS FORCED TO LEAVE TOWN The numerous hobos who are making their home on the Fair Grounds were marshalled down to the Public Building Monday afternoon to appear before justice Homer B. Benedict, charged with walking upon or along the railroad tracks of the New York Central. The unusual feature of the affair developed in the fact that Judge Benedict conducted court on this occasion in the open. The thirty-five "hos," as they are known about town, all pleaded guilty to the charge, but were dismissed on the condition that they leave town immediately. Thus was hastened the departure of these knights of the macadem whose annual inux into Brockport is occasioned by the hope that they may obtain employment at the canning factory during the fall rush.

 urlLink The Onion I was gone for three weeks, and in that time my family didn't take out the trash. I don't know why. But in three weeks, many things can rot, stink, become covered in maggots, and fester in the August sun. I returned home to find our trash room wreaking of ****. The trash was finally rid of the other day, but larvae turned into beautiful flies by that time. Now there are hundreds of flies in the house (I don't live in the house, luckily). Tonight I found them swarmed together around a single lit lightbulb. Other insects have been attracted as well, and in the minutes where I checked on the situation one stung me on the lip. I also found a neighbor's cat in my kitchen but it ran off before I could catch it. The moral of this story is: don't come to visit. I need another vacation.
