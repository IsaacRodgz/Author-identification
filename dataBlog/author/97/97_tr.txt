 urlLink From MSN Careers: Sizing Up A Potential Employer "You finally found the right job. Or so you thought. Now that you have been on the scene for two weeks, you notice how people treat you. Your boss consistently calls meetings during lunchtime -- sans food. Yesterday, you received a proposal at 4:45 p.m. to type up by 9:00 a.m. the following day. And although the company is teeming with people burning the midnight oil, there is little joyful interaction among employees." urlLink more... I can't understate this enough myself.

 Information Overload from urlLink FranklinCovey Weekly Quotes email Talk about bulking up. urlLink Pitney-Bowes , the maker of postage meters, did a study in 2000 that found the average U.S. office worker sends and receives 52 phone messages, 36 email messages, 36 pieces of regular mail, 14 faxes, and eight pager messages each day. All of this information can cause stress, memory problems, and difficulty maintaining ones attention and ability to focus. So what do you do? Slim down and start the Information Overload diet! A few tips: Overcome any reluctance you might have to throwing away files, paper and other things. The fear of discarding something that might be useful later-much, much later-holds back many of us from getting rid of stuff well never use. Develop good habits. For example, handle your paper work at the same time each day, look at what is in your in-box no more than twice a day, etc. Find a planning system that works for you. Whether its a binder to carry your planning pages, wireless phone, and handheld, or software to keep all your information synched together, FranklinCovey offers hundreds of solutions to keep you organized and productive.

 Decisions, Decisions This post is reprinted from an email I get every week from the folks at urlLink FranklinCovey . Youve been working intensely on a project for several hours and you feel your effectiveness dwindling. You have the thought that taking a break to read a little or eating an early lunch might regenerate you. But you have a deadline, and youre not sure whether the break is really renewal or escape. How do you decide? Ask with intent. This is an essential act to become principle-centered. Ask your conscience, not out of curiosity, but out of commitment to act on the wisdom of the heart. Whats the best use of my time right now? What is life asking of me? Listen without excuse. When you hear the first whispering of conscience, youll either act in harmony with it, or immediately begin to rationalize making another choice. Choosing the first option will bring you inner peace. Act with courage. Some of the greatest acts of courage are in that instant between stimulus and response in our everyday decisions in life. Effective decision-making - something to decide upon!

 urlLink ElectronicsWeb | How to Get Comfy Networking Heather Stone writes a 'must-read' article on how to do better networking. Here's a brief excerpt: Mac Carter feels like a hero. As a HR administrator for a nationwide retailer, he has opportunities to serve people in a variety of capacities. But never has he felt better about helping someone than he does now. Mac has a daughter in the Girl Scouts and while at a function with her, he met the father of one of the other kids. They got to talking over cookies and punch, and Mac learned the man was an unemployed distribution manager. Knowing that his company was in need of distribution management, Mac gave him the name and phone number of a department head that had hiring authority with his company. Within days the man called to express his gratitude, explaining their situation was fast becoming desperate. It made Mac feel good to know that he helped this man to find a job and helped his company to meet a need at the same time. This scenario is illustrative of a typical networking success. It demonstrates the power of having contacts. The rule of "who you know" has long been a key job search component. Statistics have consistently shown that over 80 percent of jobs never get advertised because they are filled through the vague technique of "networking."

 Making Contacts I'm learning that it's important to know people in order to get that job. I've enjoyed going to career fairs and attending other functions that are geared toward meeting other people. I want to be aware of other functions that come along, too. There is also the benefit of meeting someone "cold" at the library, for example. I met a young man who knows someone from a local Dayton company, and he gave me that person's information so that I can contact her. But the great thing about networking is that it's a Win/Win situation. I need to look for some way to help someone else in addition to my getting help. To be honest, it's been difficult to keep that perspective when I'm eagerly looking for a job. Even then, I need to keep in mind that someone will be hiring me because of skills that I can contribute to make them money.

 urlLink Yahoo! Dailytips - Uncovering a Cover Letter Myth Your cover letter summarizes your resume, right? Wrong! Some people think that a summary of the resume attached to the resume seems a little repetitive. The purpose of your cover letter, then, is to add a warm handshake to your resume and zero in on why the employer should be interested in you. Your cover letter should put your resume in context, drawing attention to your strengths and present nonresume material that can make a difference between you and your next closest competitor when the interviewing decision is made.

 Effectiveness Tip of the Week from a weekly email I receive from the folks at urlLink FranklinCovey First... some relevant quotes, from urlLink QuotesBlog : "Go confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you've imagined. As you simplify your life, the laws of the universe will be simpler." -- urlLink Henry David Thoreau "Awaken your sense, your intuition, your desires. Awaken the parts of yourself that have been sleeping. Life is a dream, and to live it, you must be awake." -- urlLink Rachel Snyder "True life is lived when tiny changes occur." -- urlLink Leo Tolstoy Mission Possible Ever feel like a double agent, living one life and dreaming of another? Be the leader of your life! Sound impossible? It's not, when you have a Personal Mission Statement. Here are some clues: Unique : It's different for everyone. It can be a sentence, paragraph or poem. Focus : It's a clear guide based on your values -- what you want to be and do. Ask yourself this question: "What can I imagine myself doing if time and money were not obstacles?" Passion : It's what excites you most in the world and lifts you up on your soapbox. Take 5 minutes RIGHT NOW and write as much as you can about your personal mission in life. It doesn't have to be perfect. You can revise this first draft later. Keep it in your planning device and read it morning and evening for the next week. Decide what things you can do during the day to live your mission. (Warning! This message will "self-construct" in 5 minutes...)

 Job Posting Sites Elsewhere on the Internet Dick Bolles, author of the perennial "What Color Is Your Parachute?", urlLink writes : The Internet is larger than just the World Wide Web. Outside the Web, lie USENET newsgroups, mailing lists, and a number of other modalities or protocols, as they are called. Many employers find these protocols especially newsgroups more effective than the Web, when they're searching for employees, most particularly when they're searching for technical employees. So it is to newsgroups you must go, and not just to the Web, if you're interested in those employers' job listings. There are newsgroup metasearch sites (on the Web, paradoxically) that will allow you to search a number of these newsgroups or a number of Mailing Lists all at once, rather than having to go to each newsgroup one by one. urlLink Google Groups has messages from several thousand newsgroups. If it's job listings you're looking for, just type in your query, like: jobs AND Bay Area and it will give you the actual job listings that match, in reverse order (most recent, first). You can search within specific groups or search all groups.

 Job-hunting expenses are deductible In MSN Money's article, " urlLink The top 10 overlooked deductions ," number 4 is "Let the IRS subsidize your job search." Job-hunting expenses are deductible. If you're out of work, or even if you're still employed but looking for a new job, all of your job hunting expenses are deductible as miscellaneous itemized deductions. Such expenses would include resumes, phone calls, postage, travel costs and any other expenses related to your attempt to get a new job. If youve done a lot of driving in your job search in 2002, you can deduct mileage for your 2002 return at a rate of 36.5 cents a mile. For 2003, the mileage rate falls to 36 cents a mile. Creativity here can be rewarding. For example, if you take a friend to lunch in an attempt to use him as a reference or referral, you can use the cost of the lunch as a job-hunting expense.

 Effectiveness Tip of the Week from an email I receive from the folks at urlLink FranklinCovey Your Personal Cornucopia Take stock of your personal cornucopia. Is it abundant and bountiful?

 Effectiveness Tip of the Week via the folks at urlLink FranklinCovey : First, some urlLink Quotes : "Learn to say no. It will be of far more use to you than to be able to read Latin." -- Charles Haddon Spurgeon "A 'no' uttered from the deepest conviction is better than a 'yes' merely uttered to please, or what is worse, to avoid trouble." -- Mahatma Ghandi "When your daily activities are in concert with your highest priorities, you have a credible claim to inner peace." -- Hyrum Smith No Thank You No. Nicht. Nulle. No matter how it comes out, saying "no" isn't always easy. Project overload, interruptions, and demanding coworkers can make it tough to speak this language. Remember, you have a right to say no... graciously but firmly. If you respond evasively, you'll build false expectations. Saying no takes practice. Here are some phrases that might help: "I have so much on my plate now that I don't know when I can get to it. But I do know someone over here who can help you now." "Sure, I can help you with your request as long as we both understand that what I agreed to do for you yesterday might be delayed." "Thanks for thinking about me, but no thanks." "I won't be able to do it until tomorrow, but I could provide you with some resources that might help you do it today."

 Effectiveness Tip of the Week via email from the folks at urlLink FranklinCovey : Adept at Adapting "If anything can go wrong, it will." Mr. Murphy! Just where is your silver lining? We're not into peddling pessimism, but a hearty does of reality comes in handy now and again. The proverbial "wrench in the system" can strike anywhere, anytime. Unexpected change -- it's the law. Expect it. Change happens. It's one of the few constants in society. Commonly associated with negative circumstances and outcomes, unexpected change often gets a bad rap. Yet, unexpected change can be exhilarating and extremely positive. I feel a Paradigm Shift&trade; coming on! Plan on it. Rule of thumb: "Plan weekly, adapt daily." When reviewing your daily activities, factor in time for unexpected changes -- things that throw your schedule off track. You'll feel less frustrated and more in control. Be prepared. Go with it. Kicking and screaming will only get you so far. Change is good. Adapting, adjusting, and making modifications to changing circumstances will yield new opportunities, new ideas, and new perspectives. Unexpected change -- your friend indeed! What else did you expect?

"This is the place," you think, as you wait for a bite. Another snag! You begin to reel as the tension increases. Snap! Tired of fishing for information? According to one study, you may spend up to 28 minutes a day looking for lost information. What a drag on your time and energy! Cast aside your old habits and try some new techniques: What, When, Where. When you capture information for future access, remember the basics:"What" information you'll need to access, "When" will you need it (day and time), and "Where" will you store it in your planning device. Consistency. No matter whether you use a calendar, planner, or handheld, record needed information the same way each time. Floaters. Eliminate floating information -- any piece of information you have written down that you cannot have at your fingertips within 10 seconds. Give it a try. You'll be hooked!

People with depression are more likely to call in sick and be otherwise unproductive at work. In a study that tracked 5000 people over five years, the researchers found that "42% of those who showed symptoms of depression in the study's first year eventually lost their jobs." Lead researcher Mary A. Wooley, MD, writes: There's a huge stigma associated with depression. People need to realize that depression is a disease just like diabetes and that there are plenty of treatments that offer relief from suffering and can also help you keep your job. People need to overcome the stigma and not be so embarrassed about saying: 'I need help.'

 Effectiveness Tip of the Week from the folks at urlLink FranklinCovey : Take it to the bank. KA-CHING! How are your EBAs these days? You know, your Emotional Bank Accounts -- the trust you have built up in your different relationships. Still waiting for a "statement" to arrive? Here's one: If you don't know, you're probably overdrawn! Maintaining a reserve of trust in relationships requires constant investing. Consider this advice: Bad checks . What you consider to be a deposit (like going to the movies when your date wants to talk) may actually be a withdrawal for others. They can't collect on your efforts because it does not meet their actual needs. Really understanding others is key to building trust. Pocket change . Showing respect, kindness, and courtesy may seem like small deposits, but over time they compound and increase your reserve. Neglecting the little things will soon have you in the red. Count on me . Breaking commitments or promises often can bankrupt you. Keeping them is the best way to save for a rainy day in any relationship. Rich relationships -- what a great payoff!

 Effectiveness Tip of the Week The Delicacies of Delegation Parents, managers, and people in general have trouble letting go, and when they do, it's gofer mania! "Hey, you! Go for this and go for that." It's pretty hard to supervise even one person when you are involved in every move he/she makes. Effective delegation focuses on results, not methods, and allows others to use their imagination, free will, and conscience to get the job done. Here's some advice: Desired Results. Clearly articulate what needs to be done, not how to do it. Describe in detail the desired result so that the other person virtually sees it. Guidelines. Make sure there are parameters within which people are to operate. Point out potential failure paths -- what not to do versus what to do. Resources. Help people understand what human, financial, technical, or organizational resources are available to them. Accountability. Set up standards of performance that will be used in evaluating results and when those evaluations will occur. Consequences. Specify what will happen, both good and bad, as a result of the evaluation. Effective delegation -- gofer it!

 urlLink Manpower Professional - Dayton Office Some interesting developments... Yesterday I contacted the local Manpower office (see link above) to speak to the guy with whom I'd been working on my recent assignment. I spoke to someone who stated that he no longer works for the company. I was surprised. I had just seen him with his boss a month ago at the Greater Dayton IT Alliance meeting. I asked this person if the office had a most recent copy of my resume, and I found out that they did not. Apparently, since my guy had left the company, he did not hand over the updated resume I had emailed. Okay then. So, I just emailed the office an updated copy of my resume. I sent it to their "catch-all" email address, which I found through the Office Locator portion of the website. Now, I need to send another copy to that other recruiter whom I'd emailed last week. Cheers!

 Effectiveness Tip of the Week via email from the folks at urlLink FranklinCovey I Do This Information Age can make you believe that knowing really is doing. But doing requires, well, DOING something! Many times there's a gap between knowing and doing. Yet, once you close the gap and unite knowing and doing, sparks really fly! Do I hear bells? Repeat after me: "I affirm the special bond and unique relationship that exists between knowing and doing and promise to keep it alive always." (Sniffle!) Here's some advice: Details. Planning is essential for converting ideas into action. But don't get hung up on details, wasting precious time and resources debating specifics of strategy and implementation. View plans like blueprints -- where you focus on essentials and leave room for adjustments. Embrace technology. Technology produces new tools for getting things done in a changing world. Seek every opportunity at work and at home to learn and use these tools. Risky business. Fear of failing may prevent you from doing a lot of things, yet knowing comes from doing. Be more willing to tackle risk in your life. You'll never know until you try! I now pronounce you... umm... more effective!

 urlLink Toastmasters International&trade; This afternoon my wife and I stopped at the school administration building, and I spotted an annoucment for a urlLink local Toastmasters International&trade; club . I was reminded of my recent visits to the urlLink Mid Day Cabaret , the club at urlLink LexisNexis , where I worked for a short while. Twelve years ago, when I was co-oping for General Dynamics Land Systems in Michigan, I became a member of the urlLink Hi Nooners club. Since these meetings are often open to anyone interested, I may very well attend some meetings of the local urlLink Dayton Toastmasters&trade; Clubs . These venues are great places to network, so I'll have to be sure to have plenty of business cards when I go. urlLink Find a club near you .

 More Networking Stuff Yesterday my wife, daughter, and I went bowling at a local bowling alley, caled Bowlero (cute name). It was set up as a Family Fun time by the events coordinator at Keisha's school. We got to play for a discounted price, and it was Bumper Bowling. Needless to say, my bowling average didn't improve by that much! What does this have to do with networking? As we're getting ready to leave, I started talking with another father about his child and what he does for a living. Well, I had also brought some business cards I made for myself, and I gave him and his friend a card. We also saw one of my daughter's classmates with his mother. We've been wanting to keep in touch with his parents, so I gave my wife a card to give her, along with some paper so that we could get her phone number as well. It's this aspect of the job search that I enjoy the most. It does provide immediate results, but it plants seeds that may someday come to fruition.

 I guess you could call THAT networking This morning a representative from the local gas delivery company came by to our place. He stated that he'd been ordered to either collect a certain past due amount of money from us or shut off our service. I explained to him our family's current situation, and he, while very sympathetic, explained that it would be better for us to not have it shut off and then reconnected again. Fortunately, we had the amount in the bank account. Mom was outside with us as well. I asked if he could take a check, and then went inside to get the checkbook. I returned to the representative with the checkbook and wrote the check for the past due amount. I also told him that I was grateful that they hadn't turned the service off when the weather was cold, like it was last month. The, get this: he asked me what kind of work I did. I told him that I did some computer programming, and he said that he might know of someone who could help me. I asked him if I could give him a business card. He said yes, and I went back inside to get some business cards I'd made up for myself. I gave him two of them, in fact. As the rep took off, Mom mentioned that the guy told her I'd been a lot better than many of the folks he's had to meet about similar matters like this. Mom thanked him and they got to talking about my being a Christian, and the guy said he could tell I was a Christian by how I'd behaved. So, I guess you could consider that networking.

 Effectiveness Tip of the Week via email from the folks at urlLink FranklinCovey : Finances -- Let's Get Personal You've got places to go, people to see, and things to do -- in other words, lots of bills. Show me the money! Do you know where every cent is spent? Money doesn't grow on trees, you know! Spare no expense in getting your personal finances in order. Here are a few tips: Time is money. In your planning device, schedule a daily or weekly appointment with yourself to balance the books. This is a good time to identify spending patterns and make necessary corrections. Budget constraints. Set up a monthly budget and stick to it. There are great computer programs like Quicken&copy; and Microsoft&copy; Money that'll do most of the work for you. Remember to include savings and a personal budget for you and only you. Adjust as you go. Don't throw in the towel when your budget's in the red.

 Effectiveness Tip of the Week via email from the folks at urlLink FranklinCovey Feedback-Feast on It! Today's special-feedback. Sound good? Asking for and receiving feedback requires a generous portion of humility. Although it's hard to swallow sometimes, feedback tells you as much about the people from whom you receive it as it does about yourself. Hungry for more? Here are some ideas to chew on: Large selection. Concentrate on your roles in your family, work, or community where you feel additional perspective would be helpful. For example, parents could get feedback from children, a spouse, or other parents. Different tastes. Feedback can be formal or informal, anonymous or face-to-face. You can use a questionnaire or just chat on the phone. You know what's best for you. Ingredients. Be careful not to judge each other's character. Feedback should be objective, and given against performance and effectiveness criteria. Dish it out. As soon as you receive feedback, analyze it and feed it back! Involve others in creating an action plan based on their feedback. Remember your manner and always say "Thanks." Come on, try it. You'll like it!

Whether you're looking for career information or encouragement, I'm very encouraged that you're stopping by. Let me take this moment to ask you for something. I want to let others know about how you have successfully found a job. It may be your current one or a previous one - it doesn't matter. I want to encourage other job seekers with your success. You will receive no reimbursement from this, except for the gratification that your story has helped to inspire countless others who are where you once were. Be specific, but don't mention any company names. That may sound like a contradiction in terms, and you may disagree with this approach - let me know and I may reconsider. Instead, use a generic title, such as "software development consulting company", "global consumer products company", and so on. If you would like some help, then let me know. I will only use your initials or first name and last initial when presenting your success story. I am specifically interested in answers to the following: What position were you applying for? How did you contact the particular company? Describe the interviewing process. Did you work part-time or as a contractor/consultant with the company before being hired? How long was the process from your first contact with the company to your first day of work? Describe your emotional state during the process. Were you anxious? Excited? Stressed? Impatient? Frustrated? Let us know. So email me your job hunting success stories at danimal0416[nospam]@yahoo.com(remove the [nospam], of course), and we'll get them published here at "Get That Job!"

Reflecting about or evaluating the past week is a natural process that can help relieve stress, identify weaknesses, and get you back on your feet. Don't feel pressured -- just relax and consider these tips for evaluating your week: Examination. Create a checklist of five or six self-evaluation questions and keep them in your planning system. Examples include "What challenges did I face this week and how did I overcome them?" "What goals did I not achieve and why?" "What can I learn from the week as a whole?" Regular checkup. Make an appointment with yourself each week and choose a place that is quiet. Review your questions before you plan the next week. Prevention. You'll soon identify ineffective habits and patterns. This knowledge will help you prevent making the same mistakes in the future. Weekly evaluation -- a cure for common ineffectiveness

 Effectiveness Tip of the Week via a weekly email from the folks at urlLink FranklinCovey What did you expect? "That's your job!" "We didn't agree to that!" "That's not what I meant!" If your expectations are as "clear as mud," don't expect much else than, well, a pretty messy situation. Clean up on Aisle 5! Clarifying expectations in your family, work, and other relationships will help avoid misunderstandings, disappointments, and lack of trust. Implicit vs. explicit. Some expectations in relationships are implicit, like your boss expecting you to be at work on time. Yet, many expectations are explicit, requiring further clarification. Negative situations are created when you assume your expectations are self-evident and clearly understood by others. Speak up. In new relationships, get all the expectation out on the table at the beginning. Clearly articulate who does what. Almost all relationship difficulties are a result of ambiguous expectations around roles and goals. Time and effort. It's easy to pretend differences don't exist and to hope things will work out. Investing time and effort up front to clarify expectations will save time and effort in the future. Clarifying expectations -- any questions?

 On Making Oneself Available Our family uses one phone line for regular telephone and Internet use. Our family is in such financial circumstances that we cannot afford an additional phone line or DSL. I recognized that while I am online at home that potential employers are not able to get through to us. We're trying to make ourselves more available by letting employers know they can email us, but I have a feeling that we need some other way for them to contact us. Does anyone know of a free voicemail service? We may even want to look at how much getting the phone company's voicemail system is. At least there we could have calls transferred to our voicemail if we were online or busy. It's funny, but I've asked the above question without doing an Internet search first. If I find anything, I'll post it here. Update: Good ol' Google, coming through again. Check out urlLink BuzMe . I plan on signing up for this when we get home (I'm at the urlLink Job Center now.)

I rememember when I worked as an Environmental Engineer for Alcoa Building Products, documentation was key to showing our proof that we complied with environmental laws and regulations. If it wasn't in writing, then it never happened . With that mindset, we needed to have well-organized files. I remember the color scheme for the different types of environmental "media" (for lack of a better word): blue for water/wastewater, green for solid/hazardous waste, orange for toxic chemical information, red for air resource management, and so on. We even had a document that described our file-keeping system. The intent of this was to provide quick and easy retrieval of documentation in the event of an audit and for future reporting. Our family has a number of things going on that merit good recordkeeping practices. For one thing, both my wife and I are actively looking for employment. Mileage and other job search expenses are tax-deductible, provided you have documentation. And we need to keep track of contacts, companies to whom we've sent resumes, follow up correspondence, and so on. Additionally, our daughter Keisha, has hearing loss in both ears. Several times we've needed to provide documentation for insurance, education, and medical reasons. And then there's the bills. Holy cow! Bills for everything related to running a family. There is a huge need to document that bills were paid, along with conversations with creditors and other individuals. I think a big reason why I've procrastinated in the past is because I've dreaded all the effort in getting this information together. I see now that if I put forth the work up front to get organized and document things, then, when the time comes to retrieve that information, it won't appear as daunting. So, you could say that I'm having another kind of a "birthday" today.

 Follow Your Path from a "Recipes for the Soul" card, as a matter of fact YOU WILL NEED: Perception Individuality Control "You have to do your own growing no matter how tall your grandfather was." -- Abraham Lincoln Have you ever looked at a family photo and discovered an uncanny resemblance to one of your relatives? Did you notice any differences too? Those moments of recognition remind us how connected we are to each other, but also how unique we are. It's important to cherish our common traits, but it's just as essential to achieve our own identity. SIMPLE STEPS Treat an older relative to dinner. Ask about their life and interests growing up. You may learn valuable lessons from their experiences that will help you along the way. Parents are not to blame. When life doesn't turn out exactly as planned, we have a tendencey to blame our parents. Instead, look inside yourself for answers. What happens next is up to you.

 Effectiveness Tip of the Week from the folks at urlLink FranklinCovey : Self-Exploration: The Terrain of Heart and Soul What do you really value in life? Perhaps you have taken some time lately to reflect on what resonates within you -- those ideas and convictions that need no outside validation. Because of demands on your time, you might not contemplate your values as often as you would like as you go about living. Yet it's important to make a conscious connection with those values that govern your life -- the foundations upon which your life is both anchored and navigated; things like family, humor, and respect. To help you explore your values further, try this exercise: Locate a comfortable environment free from noise and distractions. Reflect on the following questions and listen to your heart and conscience. If I had to walk away from everything I ever loved, what would be left behind? What would I miss most if it were taken from me? What is of greatest importance or value in my life? As you go about your week, it will be vitally important to determine whether or not there is consistency between where you spend your time and what you value most.

 urlLink Ohio Job Prospector Job Prospector is a research site, not a job posting site. The career information it provides is meant to provide users with an "Inside Look" at employers that is not available to most job seekers. Since they list career profiles and not job postings, the manner in which you respond to these employers is very important. If sending a resume, please be sure to explain that you researched the particular employer and are inquiring about potential career opportunities based on that research. This will help the employer understand why you have sent them your resume. It will also help to emphasize your initiative and give you the best chance for success! Update: I figured out that this site is not free, but you can have access to it at a number of public institutions (libraries, universities, and the urlLink Montgomery County Job Center ).

 A Different Kind of Bar Exam I needed something "punny" to go with this post. I had a meeting with the president of the local bartending school here in Dayton yesterday. I think I would make a good bartender -- mixologist, to be more accurate. I have an outgoing personality, and I had a chemistry set when I was growing up. Well, I never got the $300 microscope when I was 7 years old (that was in 1977 dollars, by the way). Alas, I digress. The meeting went very well, up until she mentioned the tuition. See, trying to live off unemployment has been hard to begin with. Then laying out several hundreds of dollars up front for tuition... well, the bubble went "pop". I went away, feeling a little bit downhearted. But I think that the school might be able to work with me on the tuition. After all, it's a two-week course, and the tuition is based on what an average weekly take-home pay for a bartender would be. So, in two weeks, I'd theoretically be able to make up the money I spent toward tuition. We'll see. I'm going to talk with her again on Monday afternoon. Hopefully, I'll be able to start the class that Monday, too. Stay tuned!

 Effectiveness Tip of the Week via email from the folks at urlLink FranklinCovey On the Road Again Whoops, I think we took the wrong road. I turn left, right? Where is your roadmap to your destiny in life taking you? Take some time out to seriously identify what really matters most in your life and what you really want to be and do. To really begin your journey with the end in mind means to start with a clear understanding of your destination. It means to know where you're going so you better understand where you are now so that the steps you take are always in the right direction. Find your passion. What do you care about most? Allow your passion to take more priority in life. Follow the big picture of your life. Allocate your time more efficiently and don't waste time on things that aren't important to the big picture. Spell out to yourself a dream version of your passion. How does it feel? What does it look like? Where would it take you? Get a move on. Don't wait until a better time to move toward what you want. There is no better time. The time is now. Stay open to changes. Just because things aren't going exactly to plan doesn't mean they are not in alignment. Trust the process.

The items allow small businesses to write off $100,000 in investments this year. All businesses could depreciate half their assets this year, recouping their money faster. For example, Luscombe said, a small business that spends $150,000 on new equipment this year can write off $100,000 immediately and recoup half of the remaining expense through depreciation this year. As a result, a business can immediately write off as an expense at least $125,000 of its equipment purchases. urlLink read the full article...

 Job Hunting Success - Dan It's been awhile since I've been off work. I completed a temporary assignment for a local IT company last February. While I've been able to do some web development since then, I haven't had anything substantial or consistent or otherwise. In addition, my temporary unemployment compensation has been due to expire at the end of next month. Last week I contacted the company I used to work for, just to touch base, and I spoke with someone who said he believed that there was another opportunity at the same site where I had worked previously. I told him I was interested and available, and he promised to get back with me. This morning he called me and told me that the job was for software testing, and that it was to last for the entire year. While it doesn't pay as well as I was getting previously, others have used it to springboard themselves into other opportunities. After I told him I was interested, he advised me to email him an updated copy of my resume so that he can present me to the company at his meeting with them tomorrow. I'm rather optimistic that I could get this work.

 Job Hunting Success - Jennie My wife urlLink Jennie completed a short course recently to become a nurse's assistant. After getting her certificate, she revised her resume and began looking intently for employment in that field. She spotted one of her former classmates at the urlLink Job Center , who mentioned that she'd recently been hired by a nearby nursing home/assisted-living facility, and she urged Jennie to apply. Jennie applied two weeks ago and received a rejection letter by mail this past Monday. Coincidentally, this past Monday another woman from the same facility called to ask Jennie to come in for an interview, which they scheduled for this afternoon. Jennie wasn't really expecting much from the meeting based on her recent experience with the organization. urlLink My mom and I encouraged her to give her best anyway and to simply be herself. Four hours later Jennie returned home with a very encouraging story about her meeting with the nurse. Aside from taking care of some logistical things, Jennie got the job! Whoo Hoo!

 Effectiveness Tip of the Week via email from the folks at urlLink FranklinCovey : Get SMART! Ever find yourself lamenting, "I missed it by that much!" when you don't reach a goal? You think your plans are executed with precisions, and you avoid any covert obstacles that might be placed in your path, but you still come up short. Your self-confidence wanes and you lose to the desire to make more goals. Careful! Chaos is right around the corner. Be an agent of change and get SMART with your goals. Here's the secret: Specific: Your goals should be clear and definite. Measurable: There should be a quantifiable standard against which to measure results. Achievable: Are your goals realistically doable with the time and resources available? Relevant: Is what really matters most to you reflected in your goals? Time-Dimensioned: There should be clear and specific deadlines. You'll be back in "control" sooner than you know it.

 Thoughts on the Job Fair I attended a job fair at the Dayton Job Center this past Wednesday, April 30, 2003. I've spent a lot more time at the Job Center lately, searching for a job and getting set up with other services. Last fall, I attended another job fair at the Job Center as well. I wasn't sure exactly what to expect. I knew from attending the job fair last fall that there were sure to be a lot of people there. I also expected that there would be a lot of organizations looking for people in the health care fields. Both of these expectations were met. I felt that there were so many people at the job fair that it was hard to be in a one-on-one conversation with any recruiter for very long. I noticed a long line of people waiting to talk to recruiters from one company in particular. Since my wife Jennie has been ill lately and was not able to attend the job fair, I used the opportunity to network a little bit with the health care companies that were looking for nurses asisstants. I also went to see which companies would be looking for people in my field. I saw a few of them. Yet, when I talked to company representatives in person, their recommendation was still to send my resume via the company's website or via email. I still wonder why these companies were present at the job fair at all if they were just going to ask me to send my resume to the company electronically. As I left the job fair, I was encouraged to chat with another job seeker who was looking for a job in accounting. We used the opportunity to network and share our thoughts on the job fair. I still believe that job fairs are great ways to meet companies and network with other job seekers, and I look forward to attending others in the future.

 Effectiveness Tip of the Week via email from the folks at urlLink FranklinCovey Push Pause Youve put in 8+ hours at the office; attended a PTA meeting, soccer practice, and/or a doctors appointment; and now youre in the midst of helping with homework, feeding the dog, and clearing out the answering machine. Its high time for a time-out. A walk? A movie? Nowbefore you scoff at the notion and claim it would take a sheer miracle to find extra time for that time-out, realize that it is well worth it. Taking a moment to yourself reduces stress and leaves you refreshed and focused, not irritable and distracted. Youll feel better and have a fresh outlook to tackle all the tasks that are waiting for you. A few tips: Your time-out doesnt have to be something big. Sit on the porch and enjoy a lemonade, take a small hike, or lounge on the couch with a magazine. If evenings are hectic, try waking up 30 minutes earlier to soak in the tub, walk the dog, or savor a warm drink. Do not get distracted. If your family is around, tell them theyre in charge of answering the door, the phone, and that, unless its an emergency, youre off duty for a few minutes. Pushing pause for a personal time-outrewind and try it again!

 More Job Changes I received this email from a friend and brother in Christ who drives a truck for a living. He periodically sends out broadcast updates. The latest is below: Hi there, brothers/sisters! I have some changes going on. After some advice from brothers online, I decided to change to another company. The reasons: Opportunity. This company will allow me to deliver refridgerated items (can't with Werner). Plus, I will be able to deliver to Canada! Income. By doing so, I will make more per mile than now. New business. After 30 days with this company, I can lease my own truck, and make far more, as an Independent Contractor (aka Small-Business Owner). Downside. Yes, there is one.

 Tech Thursday Wrap Up I went to urlLink Buffalo Wild Wings this evening (Thursday - haven't gone to bed yet) for the urlLink Tech Thursday event put on by the urlLink Greater Dayton IT Alliance . The restaurant had recently installed a urlLink wireless networking system (I don't know the tech term for it.), and we all wanted to see what it was like. I was impressed. There were approximately 20 laptops connected, and the speed was 1 MB per second! I showed one of the guys urlLink my fotolog as a test of a page with some pictures. It downloaded in a fraction of a second. Pretty cool stuff. I also met some other folks who are looking for work. One guy pointed me to urlLink LinksToJobs.com: the single job posting source for Cincinnati, Dayton, and Columbus, Ohio ! I've added it to the link roll, where it should be aptly put. Actually, I headed over to the bar and picked up an urlLink NTN game player . The guy who sat down next to me was an unemployed CFO - Chief Financial Officer. I suppose there's not a big demand for folks fitting that job description in the Dayton area, huh?

 Enjoy What You Do I received this email from a friend, who drives a truck across the country for a living. Another week down, and I hope all dads had a wonderful day Sunday. I am in Las Vegas for a few days of rest & relaxation with my brother, sister-in-law, and friends from church! For instance, I saw The Strip, Hoover Dam, and with some singles here, ate sushi! Gamble? Nope. I may make good money, but gambling will lose it. My trips for the week... Roanoke VA to Des Moines IA and Roseville MN (mail), Roseville MN to Denver CO (plastic drop covers), Fort Collins CO to Las Vegas NV (Budweiser beer). Anyway, I pray you all find joy in something you do. Why do something just for money, when you can find a job that both pays AND makes you happy? I understand some may have a job simply to make money, and if so, enjoy it!

 urlLink Wit, Charm and Talent Can Make You Money So says this article. It appears that some companies are conducting "spirit training" among their employees. For example, Song, the new low-cost startup from Delta Air Lines, hired one aspiring flight attendant only after he "belted out a 15-minute rendition of 'Mustang Sally'." I can see where this is a pretty good idea for some companies, but I wouldn't expect anything like this to be the case for a bank. urlLink Read more of the article to see what Bank of America is doing .

 Job Search Frustrations Today, on the way from my therapist appointment, I saw that the Longhorn restaurant on Dorothy Lane had just opened. I went inside to get an application. One of the managers told me to come back at 2 PM this afternoon so that we could talk about a bartending position. I filled out the application, and got changed for the interview. When I arrived at the restaurant, the gentleman with whom I spoke earlier wasn't available. I talked with another manager/partner, who told me, "If you had only been here 3 weeks ago..." This was not what I needed to hear, but I finished the meeting gracefully. Then I went to the bartending school just to check in. The manager there told me to call her back before 5 PM today. I then went to "Restaurant Row" along Miller Lane to obtain and complete applications at restaurants I had not previously applied to earlier. It was a "learning experience." Many of these restaurants do not hire bartenders, but instead hire servers who later get "promoted" to bartenders. I told one proprietor of a certain "Austrailian-themed" restaurant that I was willing to be a server, but he basically said that, unless I had 2 to 3 years of experience serving I shouldn't even consider completing an application for his restaurant. I asked him if he knew where I could go to get this experience he was looking for. He didn't have any idea. I was very upset and frustrated at what he said, and my whole saga of finding a job, by this time. He offered his hand for me to shake, and, at first, I didn't want to do it, but I resisted the urge to be rude and shook it anyway. As I walked out, I thought about getting some rotten eggs and returning to the restaurants. I won't, though. I came home and vented. You may be aware that I have a blog called " urlLink Letters to God ." It is a great way for me to pray, and I feel better for having done it. Much better than I would have if I, say, found some rotten eggs, if you know what I mean. I could probably continue this post for a little while, but I guess I'll end it here. Let me encourage you to share your frustrations. Write them down, share with a friend or confidant, send an email - just be open with it so that you can feel better. Sometimes having a listening ear is the best therapy. Bar's open! :)

 Make the Most of Every Opportunity My daughter started Kindergarten last week, and I met another family, whose daughter gets picked up at the same bus stop. I told the mom about my looking for a job, and a day or so later, she told me that she'd been looking at her company's job board for me. I didn't ask her to do it, but she did it anyway. We're getting ready to head to the bus stop shortly, and I've created another few business cards to give her. That way she'll have my email address and other information so that she can forward me email, and she can also forward my card to other potential interested parties. Never miss an opportunity to network! Update: She wasn't there this morning. Perhaps her daughter was ill. Maybe tomorrow!

 urlLink How Hiring Works Wow! This is a good article about urlLink Interviewing Techniques , and it includes other links to pages that describe how the whole hiring process works.

Brought to you by the folks behind " urlLink HowStuffWorks.com ."

 urlLink More Job Seekers Are Trying To Hide Their Ages According to a urlLink recent article in USA Today , a survey conducted by the online job board HotJobs reveals that many older job seekers are omitting dates or work experience from their resumes, while others are opting for hair coloration products, or, in some cases, cosmetic surgery, to make themselves appear younger to potential employers. Take resume fudging, for example: Some career strategists push job applicants to omit dates from rsums. Career coach Kathy Sanborn routinely advises clients to omit graduation dates and list only the last 10 years of their work history. Be careful, though, as such tactics can backfire. Some hiring managers may see omissions in work experience as another reason to remove the resume from their pile. This begs an important question, which I offer to you, gentle readers and job seekers: How do you go about placing enough work experience (if you have a lot of it) on your resume while keeping it to an appropriate length, usually a maximum of two pages?

 Proof That Your Job May Not Be That Bad? Yesterday, urlLink Karen posted from an email she recently received (check out the Thursday, July 24, 2003 post -- permalinks are not available). I recalled reading the story some time ago, and on a hunch I checked out urlLink Snopes.com to see if it was a true story. urlLink They couldn't really determine whether it was or not, but claim that certain details of the story are suspect . At the same time they agree that there is no harm in enjoying the story. I prefer the version that Karen posted because it doesn't contain as much profanity as the one on the urlLink Snopes.com page does. So, without further ado, here it is: This is even funnier when you realize it's real! Next time you have a bad day at work, think of this guy. Rob is a commercial saturation diver for Global Divers in Louisiana. He performs underwater repairs on offshore drilling rigs. Below is an E-mail he sent to his sister. She then sent it to radio station 103.2 on FM dial in Ft. Wayne, Indiana, who was sponsoring a worst job experience contest. Needless to say, she won. Hi Sue, Just another note from your bottom-dwelling brother. Last week I had a bad day at the office. I know you've been feeling down lately at work, so I thought I would share my dilemma with you to make you realize it's not so bad after all. Before I can tell you what happened to me, I first must bore you with a few technicalities of my job. As you know, my office lies at the bottom of the sea. I wear a suit to the office. It's a wet suit. This time of year the water is quite cool. So what we do to keep warm is this: We have a diesel powered industrial water heater. This $20,000 piece of equipment sucks the water out of the sea. It heats it to a delightful temperature. It then pumps it down to the diver through a garden hose, which is taped to the air hose. Now this sounds like a darn good plan, and I've used it several times with no complaints. What I do, when I get to the bottom and start working, is take the hose and stuff it down the back of my wet suit. This floods whole suit with warm water. It's like working in a Jacuzzi. Everything was going well until all of a sudden, my butt started to itch. So, of course, I scratched it. This only made things worse. Within a few seconds my butt started to burn. I pulled the hose out from my back, but the damage was done. In agony I realized what had happened. The hot water machine had sucked up a jellyfish and pumped it into my suit. Now, since I don't have any hair on my back, the jellyfish couldn't stick to it. However, the crack of my butt was not as fortunate. When I scratched what I thought was an itch, I was actually grinding the jellyfish into the crack of my butt. I informed the dive supervisor of my dilemma over the communicator. His instructions were unclear due to the fact that he, along with five other divers, were all laughing hysterically. Needless to say I aborted the dive. I was instructed to make three agonizing in-water decompression stops totaling thirty-five minutes before I could reach the surface to begin my chamber dry decompression. When I arrived at the surface, I was wearing nothing but my brass helmet. As I climbed out of the water, the medic, with tears of laughter running down his face, handed me a tube of cream and told me to rub it on my butt as soon as I got in the chamber. The cream put the fire out, but I couldn't poop for two days because my butt was swollen shut. So, next time you're having a bad day at work, think about how much worse it would be if you had a jellyfish shoved up your butt. Now repeat to yourself, "I love my job, I love my job, I love my job.

 The Balancing Act Compared to 25 years ago, the typical family puts in 1,000 more hours a year at work and more than 8 million of us work two or more jobs. So it's no wonder that finding a balance between work and life is difficult. But balance is essential to our well-being and our ability to perform well at home and at work. Here are five ways to get a better footing: Simplify. Need help with housecleaning? Consider hiring a cleaning person once a week. Feel like you don't have time? Say "no" to things you don't want to do or don't have time to do. Be grateful. Even in the midst of the most hectic and stressful times of life, there are things for which we can be thankful. Reflecting on the good things in our lives helps keep an all-important balance in our outlook. Be a kid and play. Get down in the dirt and help the kids make mud pies, watch a movie with them, or have a long chat over coffee with your teen. Give your family one-on-one time. Pay attention to yourself. If you don't stay healthy, you'll be less able to handle the stress of work and home. Stop procrastinating. It takes more energy fretting over not doing a project than actually doing it. So save your energy for better things and just get started. Source: Ragan Communications

 urlLink President Bush's Radio Address: July 19, 2003 I just read via the urlLink U.S. Newswire , the text of the President's weekly radio address. He talks a lot about the Jobs and Growth Act of 2003, which he recently signed into law: ... Next week, the United States Treasury will begin printing and mailing more than 25 million child tax credit checks, putting over $12 billion back into the hands of American families. These rebates are the result of the Jobs and Growth Act I recently signed into law, which increases the child tax credit from $600 to $1,000 per child. And because this new law reduced income tax rates, businesses earlier this month lowered tax withholding for worker paychecks. Now, those workers and their families have a lighter tax bill and more take-home pay... ... My administration remains focused on faster economic growth that will translate into more jobs. Now that Americans can keep more of what they earn, we can expect to see rising demand for goods and services. And as demand increases, companies will need more workers to meet it... ... Government does not create prosperity. Government can, however, create the conditions that make prosperity possible. The Jobs and Growth Act of 2003 was based on the fundamental faith in the energy and creativity of the American people. With hard work and daily determination, entrepreneurs and workers are moving this economy forward. The American economy is headed in the right direction, and we can be confident of better days ahead.

 Duck, duck, goose. The game of chasing each other, fighting for a spot in the circle. And this, my fowl-loving friend, may not be a game you left behind in kindergarten. Think about the people in your life who might be fighting for a spot in your circle - your circle of recognition. If you adopt a pattern of life that focuses on golden eggs and neglects the goose, you will soon be without the asset that produces golden eggs. On the other hand, if you only take care of the goose with no aim toward the golden eggs, you soon won't have the wherewithal to feed yourself or the goose. Now, before you ruffle your feathers, here are a few tips: Be timely. Don't wait. Praise should be given as soon as possible after the action or achievement occurs. Think individual-individual. Recognize the individuals who took the positive action. If it was a group effort, first recognize the individuals and then the group as a whole. Be sincere. Be sincere and show that you care; otherwise the recognition does more harm than good. Sincere recognitionan eggcellent approach!

 Monthly Focus: Abundance In my Franklin Planner there is a montly focus that changes each month. This month the focus is on having an "abundance-mentality." It states: Live with the attitude that there is an abundance of resources and opportunities. I think that this is especially important to have with respect to the job search. I find myself thinking that I have so much competition for a particular job. If I win, then someone else loses. This monthly focus is a challenge to see things differently. Sure, the competition for jobs is heavy right now. But why not think as though your job is out there, waiting for you to find it. I've posted a number of great quotations about Abundance over at urlLink QuotesBlog for today, 2 July 2003. I cannot link to all of them here, because they are all worthy of reading.

 urlLink President Bush's Weekly Radio Address for August 2, 2003 In President Bush's weekly radio address to the nation this past weekend, he spoke mainly of how the economy is behaving, and commented specifically about job-creation and unemployment, among other things. I've included some exerpts from his address below, but urlLink you may want to read the entire text yourself: This week, we received some encouraging news on the economy. The nation's economy grew faster than expected in the second quarter. ... Yet this week's employment report also shows that many Americans who want to work are still having trouble finding a job. My administration is acting to promote faster growth to encourage the creation of new jobs. The key to job growth is higher demand for goods and services. With higher demand, businesses are more likely to hire new employees. The best way to promote growth and job creation is to leave more money in the pockets of households and small businesses, instead of taxing it away. So we lowered income tax rates, cut taxes on dividends and capital gains, reduced the marriage penalty and increased the child tax credit. This week, the checks for up to $400 per child started arriving in the mailboxes of American families. That money will help American families move the economy forward. We have also taken action to help small businesses, who are the job creators of America. We increased tax incentives for equipment purchases, giving small businesses an additional reason to invest. More orders for machinery and equipment means more jobs. And more business investment can lead to greater worker productivity, which helps raise worker wages. We are starting to see results from our actions. My administration's economists believe that if we had not passed tax relief, our unemployment rate would have been nearly one percentage point higher, and as many as 1.5 million Americans would not have the jobs they have today. ... America's economy has challenges, and I will not be satisfied until every American looking for work can find a job. By steady, persistent action, we are preparing the way for vigorous growth and more jobs. I have confidence in our economic future, because I have confidence in the people whose effort and creativity make this economy run -- the workers and the entrepreneurs of America.

 urlLink Ten Songs for Job Seekers MSN Careers examines ten songs that apply to job seekers. Interesting. Which one describes you?

 And Then There's This "Today's drop in the unemployment rate is positive and surpasses market expectations. The drop in the labor force is due primarily to seasonal factors. "We are encouraged by the steadily declining four-week moving average of new unemployment insurance claims, which also shows that job losses are slowing down significantly. "We can also see where the new jobs are being created, such as temporary help services, which tends to be a leading indicator that signals stronger, more widespread job growth in the future. Other areas with job growth include leisure and hospitality, financial activities and, for the fifth straight month, construction." -- Secretary of Labor Elaine L. Chao on July unemployment numbers released today, August 1, 2003 via urlLink U.S. Newswire

 urlLink jobforjohn.com John, who was recently "downsized" from a software company, followed President Bush's economic team (Treasury Secretary John Snow and Commerce Secretary Don Evans) around this week and even was able to talk to Snow directly: "What's your story?" Snow says. I tell him I was laid off last week and saw that he was coming and I thought it was important to come here and let him see the reality of what's going on in today's economy. "What industry were you in?" "Most recently the software industry." "That's a particularly vulnerable part of the economy." "Yes, well, I need a new job and it doesn't look good." "Just wait," he said. "The first tax cuts haven't really taken effect. So just wait... the second tax cut... well, it won't hit the economy for several months, but I'm sure you'll get a job." "But, but... we've already lost over 900,000 jobs just since March first... a job at Wal-Mart just won't support my family." "Just wait, I'm sure you'll find a job." At that moment the car in front of me pulled ahead for their order and John stepped back from my window. The SS agents signalled for me to pull ahead. "Just wait?!" I've got a $350 payment for this minivan, a morgage and two kids! Here's a guy who drives a few hundred miles to see you, four days after he's been laid off, and you tell him to "just wait?" Boy I'd like to see those words on a PR banner behind Snow at the podium: Jobs and Growth: Just Wait. urlLink Secretary Snow later mentioned the conversation to reporters . I found out about this story via urlLink Metapop .

 urlLink Will your job move to India? A frequent topic of conversation (or the subject of posts, at least) lately has been the future of the job market, both in the short term and the long term. urlLink This fantastic article from MSN Money describes what's happening in the job market. The bottom line, according to John Challenger, CEO of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the Chicago-based outplacement firm: Its false to think the only jobs that could go overseas are low-skilled jobs that pay low wages. Yet the tone of the article is not all doom for job seekers. In fact, it offers some encouraging words and even, for those looking for careers in areas that will be huge, some direction. So, take heart, and urlLink head over to the article!

 urlLink So, where are all the jobs? This is the question posed by urlLink U.S. News & World Report as well as by many job seekers. In a somewhat technical discussion, the editorial examines why unemployment remains where it is, and indicates that there is a "glimmer of hope for the jobless:" And here, at last, there is a glimmer of hope for the jobless. GDP growth may be accelerating and may move above 5 percent for the next two quarters. If it does, there will surely be a whole lot more jobs, especially in the labor-intensive service sector. What's to be done? Not much, for now. No fiscal stimulus is possible, and the administration has already overdone its tax cuts. The only source of macroeconomic support will come from the Federal Reserve Board. It should keep short-term interest rates low and make sure rates for 10 years and longer don't spike any more. This, then, is the opinion of Mortimer B. Zuckerman.

 urlLink President Bush Marks National Small Business Week In his weekly radio address to the nation, President Bush praised small business owners (emphasis mine): Every day, millions of Americans put in long hours building businesses of their own. Their hard work strengthens the economy, creates most of the new jobs in America , and supplies the innovation that drives our future prosperity. As we mark National Small Business Week, our nation honors the enterprise and hard work of small business owners and employees. Small businesses are a key to upward mobility, particularly for women and minorities. There are over 3 million minority-owned small businesses across America, and that number is rising. And women-owned businesses now employ more than 9 million Americans. For the sake of all small businesses and our entire economy, my administration is pursuing an aggressive pro-growth, pro-jobs agenda. The tax relief I have signed since I took office will save 25 million small business owners an average of more than $2,800 this year. Income tax relief is particularly helpful for business owners who pay their business taxes at their individual income tax rates. We have reduced the burden of unnecessary regulation on small businesses, and we have passed much needed incentives for investment and new equipment, which will help our small businesses grow and create high-paying jobs . These policies are working. A recent survey of small businesses shows rising optimism among owners, evidence of improving sales, and more plans to invest and hire new workers . This is good news for our communities and good news for people looking for work . The President then continues, "Still, there is more to be done. I have proposed a six-point plan to create jobs , strengthen small businesses and build employer confidence." Let's hear it for the small business owners and their employees!

 More Readers' Comments Sandra posted a comment to urlLink last week's post about Interviewers' Pet Peeves : I think that employers are overly-scrutinizing prospective employees in this day and time. The fact that recruiters have access to their potential employees whole life history is a violation of personal freedom. Criminal backround checks, for example, should notify the employer if the person is a murderer, a bank robber, or a rapist. In light of technological advances, an employer may look at a minor offense on the prospective employee's record as a reflection of the way that person is, no matter if they have changed or not. I think employers should be trained to be more empathetic when making a decision on whether or not to hire. I also think that employers shouldn't have the right to inspect a person's history that isn't relevant to the future job. For example, if a rapist applies for a job taking care of people, the answer of course would be "no". If a bank robber applies for as a cashier, the answer again: "no". However, if a person who has a history of drunken driving applies for a job as a janitor then the fact that the drunken driving record has no relevance to the job applied for then the history sould be taken note on but shouldn't interfere with the chance of getting the job, unless of course the job involves driving, if the person hasn't been through some sort of rehabilitation.

 urlLink Staying Networked Here's an article that offers some tips on how to keep your network alive. This is good advice for any aspect of business or -- if I can reach a little bit -- life in general. I touched on this a little yesterday, but I found the words of another to add to it: What a lot of people dont recognize, until they are faced with a job search, is that it pays to stay networked particularly in good times, when you dont feel the need as much to keep in touch. Staying networked on a regular basis will put you steps ahead of everyone else who has not remained connected when it comes time for a job search or getting the information or resources you need. In the meantime, too, you'll probably find some way to help someone else along the way. It's hard for me to pinpoint exact instances in which this blog has helped someone get a job, but I know that you're out there reading it.

 The Commute I read in a recent copy of the urlLink Dayton Business Journal that the Dayton area is one of the best areas in the country as far as commuting times is concerned. I also recall hearing that Atlanta is one of the worst. Commuting distance is definitely something to consider in your job search. Relocation may or may not be feasible, and the total amount of travel time during the day can be prohibitive in some cases. Or not. Not since I was in college have I had a job where I didn't need to drive at least a half hour to work. It was great to take the bus where I needed to go and not have to pay attention to traffic, etc. For my first job out of college, I travelled one hour one way to work for almost three years. When I got a consulting job, we moved halfway between the consulting territory, yet I still had assignments that meant at least a 40-minute commute. Of course, if you work from home or telecommute, your commuting time is only the time from the bedroom to the office or wherever you do your work!

 Keeping in Touch In general I think I've done a poor job in keeping in touch with people from high school, college, and former workplaces. Yet I'm beginning to see some changes to that, thanks to the ability to develop and maintain a web presence. The most recent example follows. I recently posted something about one of my former college classmates in my blog " urlLink Journey Inside My Mind ." The urlLink post refers to a band he was the drummer for, called "Deus Ex Machina." I checked that blog's referrer logs, and I saw that someone did a Google Search for his name. I wondered if he had done the search on himself (I do this sometimes, too.), and thought that maybe I could track him down if he has any other internet presence. It turned out that he does. He's a drummer for a different band now, called " urlLink Chrome ." I sent him a quick email, and I look forward to his reply.

 urlLink Worker blogs raise some company concerns Blogging on the job has both proponents and opponents, as this article from USA Today illustrates. Be careful about your time blogging on the job; it may come back to bite you if you're not.

 Long Time, No Blog Well, it's been about a week since I last posted. A classmate from high school contacted me recently. He works for urlLink Stelter and Brinck, Ltd. , a company that manufactures industrial process heat equipment. I mention the company name, not because they're hiring or anything like that; I don't really know. I guess I've posted it here to show that I've tried to make it easy for people to stay in touch with me, and it's encouraging to see it paying off.

 More news about the job market I just finished reading urlLink this article from the Business section of USA Today . Most of it contains information I've already mentioned here, yet there are some unique aspects that still deemed it worthy of a link here. As I read the article, I found myself trying to look between the lines to see where and how the information conveyed helps me as a job seeker (Even though I currently have a job, I still find myself wanting to behave as though I'm still looking, albeit not as aggressively.). How does this same information I've read before affect my job search in the short term and long term? I used to work for an IT consulting company. I now work at a hotel as a bartender. I like the change, but more specifically, I like that I'm making money to help support my family. I was willing to take this job, even though I don't get paid the same income I had as a consultant. One thing I know the condition of the economy and job market has affected me is that I've had to seriously examine the kind of work I used to do and ask myself if I wanted to continue down that path or pursue something different. I think that a number of individuals are in the same situation. So, read the USA Today article with a grain of salt, and use what you learn to help you figure out what you can do to improve your job situation. As always, comments are welcome and appreciated!

 U.S. Labor Department Announces Grants to Promote Women in Apprenticeship and Nontraditional Occupations WASHINGTON, Oct. 1 /U.S. Newswire/ -- The U.S. Department of Labor today announced $1 million in grants to benefit women entering nontraditional occupations.

 urlLink Handling Awkward Interviewing Situations MSN Careers offers some advice on how to handle awkward interviewing situations, with a specific look at three scenarios.

 An Interesting Dream I had an interesting dream yesterday. I dreamt that I was asked to help out with an software application I worked on some time ago, and I was able to offer some preliminary help on the spot. This application was the most recent one I'd worked on last winter, and I didn't realize it was a dream until after I woke up. I guess that's usually how it happens, huh? One thing interesting about it was that I was using the computer used by another client manager from a project I'd worked on several years ago. I guess this stays true to the tagline of my other blog, " urlLink Journey Inside My Mind ": My dreams are weirder than yours.

 Worst Jobs You've Ever Had I suppose that it's not uncommon for anyone to take a job that, for whatever reason, becomes like a "thorn in the flesh." Sometimes these jobs are necessary just to make ends meet; one might even call them "survival jobs." These jobs are are the ones that, long after leaving them, we often reflect on them and say, "That was one of the worst jobs I've ever had." urlLink Rasmus recently started a new job, and he's mentioned that the work schedule is placing a heavy burden on his ability to stay up with his ability to succeed at school: I have a simple job: Wipe that desk, vacuum this floor, clean this bathroom. Anyone can do it and the pay is fair. But six hours five days a week is affecting my schoolwork. I'm not home 'til midnight, and though I'm extremely tired, I still need an hour or so to settle down. At school, I'm so tired, I can hardly finish a sentence, much less listen to what anyone else have to say, and doing projects is out of the question. It's not working. His experience reminded me of a job I had as a security guard while in college. I initially took the job because I would have time to sit and do homework. But I soon realized that it would be an extreme test of endurance and stamina. After a full day of school on Friday, which began at 7 AM, I went to a part-time job at a hardware store from 5 PM to 9 PM. Immediately after that, I went to my security post, and I worked from 11 PM to 11 AM on Saturday By the time I returned home, I'd been awake for almost 29 hours straight. All I could do was sleep until I had to wake up to go back to the 11 PM to 11 AM thing from Saturday night to Sunday morning. I had a different post that I would go to from about 11:30 PM Sunday night through 8:30 AM Monday. While I learned a lot about myself during this time, I'd still have to say that it was one of the worst jobs I've ever had. >> What about you ? What are some of the worst jobs you've ever had?

 Seasonal Employment, Part 1 We've been slowly unpacking the rest of our stuff. I say 'we', but I really mean my wife Jennie. One of the items she found is fond reminder of a job I had at Christmastime while in college. A clipping from the December 24, 1993 front page of the Cincinnati Enquirer contains a photo of me. The caption under the photo reads as follows: Dan Johnson, Jr., a senior at the University of Cincinnati, helps Logan Abner, 2, put money into the [Salvation Army] kettle at the Madeira Kroger store Thursday. Johnson plays the saxophone to lure donations. The photo was taken by Glenn Hartong, and it shows me bundled up, wearing a Santa cap, with my alto saxophone hanging from my neck, helping Logan put his coins into the kettle. I remember that job fondly. I needed it to have money for rent and stuff. The folks at the Madeira Kroger warmly welcomed my music. Every so often, as I would get cold, I'd go inside for a break. The crew of cashiers would ask me to play "O Holy Night" for them. I did, and everyone applauded. I was grateful to be able to cheer them up. I also recall being encouraged by one of my friends' mom. I actually knew her because she took a class with me in college. She lived in Madeira, and once, on her way out of the store, she handed me a cookie and cup of hot chocolate. How very thoughtful! I read in this past Sunday's classifieds that the Salvation Army is looking for talented musicians to man their kettles again this year. It something to consider. crossposted to urlLink Journey Inside My Mind

 Change One Thing... Mike over at urlLink _monk recently reflected on his career change. At first he thought his time in his earlier career was a waste, but then he concludes: then i realized, without the background in business i wouldn't be who i am. i prob would not appreciate what a great job teaching is and would prob not be as effective of a teacher (to the degree i am effective). as anyone who has ever wrote a computer program or read about chaos theory (or seen a bad sci-fi movie) knows changing one small thing in a complex system (such as life) often has wide reaching and unexpected consequences...

 urlLink Psychological Tests Becoming Big at Work A recent study states that one in three employers is using these tests in the hiring process. urlLink ABCNews has the details... And here's a quote from the article: Long popular in Europe, the tests are now becoming more common among U.S. and multi-national firms keen on determining what kind of workers their employees are, how well they'll get a long with others and whether or not they're suited for a particular job. Some other headings in the article include Top to the Bottom Testing , which talks about how these tests are being administered for CEO candidates as well as sales associates for a retail chain; Seeking the Emotionally Intelligent , which describes how tests are being done to assess a candidates disposition and how he or she may work with others; The Writing's on the Application , which shares how some companies are using handwriting analysis to "help weed out applicants who might be untrustworthy, or to hire people who have qualities like integrity or reliability." For the job seeker this presents some challenges. When I went through job outplacement, I was taught how to answer interviewing questions in a way that would project a positive impression of myself to the interviewer. For example, one of the common questions was about my biggest weakness. The way to answer this question is to talk about a weakness and turn it into a potential strength. I would think that the best strategy for these psychological tests is to be completely honest in answering the questions. Trying to answer a question based on what you think the employer wants to hear may not be in your best interest. In addition, it's difficult to discern how a potential employer will use the results of such tests. They may perceive answers to questions differently from how you do, for example. Just be honest and do your best.

 Five Myths About Holiday Job Hunting via an emailed newsletter from urlLink Execs-Direct.com by Sinara Stull O'Donnell When I was an executive and a corporate recruiter, I found that December was my busiest and most stressful month. It's no exaggeration to say I often made job offers on Christmas Eve and came in the day after Christmas to do the paperwork so that an employee could start Jan. 2. Yet, the misconception that nobody hires in December is common, as is the poor advice that "you might as well take the month off." It may seem counterintuitive, but the opposite is true. Holiday job-search myths have been around for a long time and are repeated like mantras, but shatter when scrutinized. Consider the following: Myth No.1: "Nobody hires in December" December is still a month employees are being paid to work. There are five reasons companies may hire in December: Many companies must spend the money in their budgets before the end of the year. Hiring "heats up in December because hiring managers are trying to reach deadlines to use budgets," says Susie Basanda, principal of Basanda Consulting, a recruitment management company in Ventura County, Calif. People tend to want to tie up loose ends before the new year. Hiring managers, human-resource representatives and executive recruiters are like the rest of us who have that feeling of urgency as the year-end approaches. If there are unfilled positions on their staffs, hiring managers naturally want to fill them. Positions open up in late November or early December because many professionals quit their jobs this time of year. As David Knowles, a senior recruiter with Excel Unlimited, an executive search firm in Houston, says, "The holidays can bring on a time of longing to be closer to family, roots and people. If no bonus is involved, people often will quit Dec. 1, and give two weeks notice so that they can be with family for the holidays." Headhunters are more motivated to place candidates before the end of the year. Almost all executive recruiters are paid on commission. This commission is based on fees their company earns for placing professionals. What helps the December job seeker is that this commission rises based on overall yearly billing. One might start the year at 30% and graduate to 60% by December. The catch is that it goes down to 30% again Jan. 1. Strong companies often want to start the new year with a bang. "Companies that are forecasting profits want to have key people in place to start the year off well," says Knowles. Myth No. 2: "You won't find the job you really want in December" You're just as likely to find the job you really want in December as in any other month. One reason is because you won't have as much competition, says Judy Kneisley, senior vice president and general manager for outplacement firm Lee Hecht Harrison Inc. "Because so many people believe in the myths, it's a perfect time to be out there," she says. It may sound logical that only losers would be desperate enough to look for jobs during the holidays, says Knowles, but "the fact is that winners are looking in December." Winners don't give up. Myth No. 3: "Nothing ever happens after Dec. 15, so you might as well leave town" Most recruiters advise job candidates to be flexible in scheduling interviews and meetings around the holidays. Eberhart goes a step further and advises candidates to avoid taking weeklong trips during the holidays. Basanda once held a round of interviews New Year's Day. Myth No. 4: "Even if an employer has an opening, the hiring manager won't have time to meet with you" The interviewing process can be slower during the holidays because of the number of days people are out of the office. But, as Basanda says, the process "will slow down but it doesn't stop." Myth No. 5: "You'll have a better chance if you wait until the first of the year" If employers have a need, they don't care whether it's January or December. "[Hiring] isn't focused on the time of year. It's focused on need," says Keith Mills, vice president for Aaron's Automotive, a manufacturer in Springfield, Mo. Ms. O'Donnell is a free-lance writer and a career consultant in Springfield, Mo. This article was abridged from urlLink CareerJournal.com .

 Advice From Successful Job Seekers: Don't Neglect Your Network by Caroline Levchuck (via urlLink My Yahoo! Daily Tip ) Curtis Potter wasn't even actively seeking full-time work when he was appointed creative director of an advertising agency. He credits his new job to his solid professional network. Potter had left his most recent job on good terms and had stayed in touch with his boss when he moved cross-country. "I would visit whenever I went back to the West Coast and have dinner with him when he came to New York," said Potter. Potter also built a strong network in and around New York City. "A former colleague from a local agency called me and told me about the opening, and I sent my resume in. She talked me up to her bosses and they reviewed my resume. It turned out that they knew my previous employer," said Potter. "I had two strong references going for me -- a former colleague and a former boss. The agency interviewed tons of people, but I think these connections made all the difference," said Potter. This is great news.

 Job Hunting Success Story Sue T. responded to urlLink a recent post and shared her job hunting success story: Cheers !!! I finally got a job!! I got my job through a website called urlLink www.jobs.net . I was doing my daily job search at my local workforce one in Florida, and I stumbled across this website, which I'd never heard of before. I decided to check this site out, and I found a position called yacht finance specialist (a.k.a administrative assistant). The funny thing about this position was it posted on August 18, 2003, and it was still on their site on November 12, 2003. I called the employer, and the reason why they did not find anyone was because none of the other candidates had passed the credit check. The company is owned by a bank, and passing a credit check is required. In the post to which Sue responded, we posed some specific questions. Below we've listed the questions along with her answers. What position were you applying for? Administrative Assistant How did you contact the particular company? I called the company and then faxed them my resume Describe the interviewing process. It was pretty simple. They were only interested in me because they had already posted this position on urlLink careerbuilder.com and had not yet found anyone qualified for it. Did you work part-time or as a contractor/consultant with the company before being hired? No How long was the process from your first contact with the company to your first day of work? I interviewed for the position on November 18th. I returned on December 1st and was hired after I found out I passed the credit check. Describe your emotional state during the process. Were you anxious? Excited? Stressed? Impatient? Frustrated? Let us know. I kept wondering why the credit check was taking so long.

 urlLink F**k That Job! takes a humorous look at the job market, highlighting the unusual, unreasonable, even ridiculous job postings out on the internet. From a Craig's List post "seeking a workaholic (and I mean workaholic) who is interested in total immersion in their job (if you are not inclined to this requirement with 24/7 availability do not respond to this ad)" to the jobseeker who is auctioning himself on eBay, this web site got a chuckle or two out of me.

 urlLink VistaPrint Free Business Cards When you're out networking for your next job contact, it's a good idea to have a personal business card handy. One method I've seen which is particularly interesting is to include sort of a mini-resume - some bulleted highlights of your specific job skills or areas of expertise. The essentials to include on a networking business card include: Name Phone Email address Web site (where hopefully a description of your talents and your resume can be found) Depending on your area of expertise, including a title or functional area might also be a good idea (i.e. Marketing Professional, Quality Specialist, Technical Consultant, etc.). Re: the above noted URL, VistaPrint offers "free" business cards for the cost of shipping only (about $5), but these cards do include a text ad for vistaprint on the back. You can also print up cards on your personal printer (ok as long as you have a real paper cutter - the perforated edges on preprinted business card stock a la urlLink Paper Direct is sort of tacky), or check out your local Kinko's or Mailboxes Etc for low cost card printing options.

 urlLink Yahoo! Groups : jobsearchsupport Newsgroups, Yahoo Groups and Job related discussion boards are an excellent way of networking online with other job seekers, sharing support, job leads, search ideas, and more.

 urlLink Dice.com - Job search for Technology Professionals Today, I read through my automated job search agent for DICE.com, and found no less than 5 job postings by recruiters for the SAME JOB. 5 out of 21 jobs returned works out to roughly 25% of my time wasted reading the same job description. The thing that I've learned about many of these recruiter posts is that if you do a little bit of research, often you can find the employer on the web and apply for the job directly. Since recruiters charge a fairly hefty percentage for their services, it makes me wonder whether employers are using them at all these days, or if they give preference to candidates that come to them directly, without the extra price tag. This is not to say that I haven't found jobs through recruiters in the past - just that in today's market, I'm wondering whether they are still of any use...

 Job-Searching During the Holidays If you're looking for a job, then the holidays present some great opportunities to continue your job search. During the various get-togethers, you can network with those around you. Friends, family, and so on. Check out some past posts related to networking ( urlLink Google search results ).

 Why? A simple question a post from the urlLink Occupational Adventure (sm) Blog I should preface this post with an explanation that I am a urlLink Passion Catalyst (sm) - in short, I help people identify their passions and create careers that ignite them. When it comes to finding your passion in your career, there's no way around it. Self-exploration is where it all starts. Want a short, simple way to squeeze exponentially more insights from those self-exploration efforts? The secret word o' the day is... "Why?" Just that one little word, vigorously applied, will give you incredible insights. For example, take a look at a commonly recommended question for finding your career passion..."What do you love doing?" A valuable question, but by itself it falls far short of the insights that could be gotten by following the answers up with, "why?" Because "what" you love doing isn't the whole story. You can say, "I love doing _____," but whether you're conscious of it or not, what you really mean is "I love doing _____ because _____, _____, and _____." You and I could say we love the exact same thing, and the underlying reasons might be completely different. Asking "Why? What is it about it that is so enjoyable?" lets you dig down and find the underlying characteristics of the things you love doing. Once you know those, you can start trying to incorporate them into your career, whether by making small changes where you are, or identifying a whole new direction.

 urlLink Job Search Tracking - Keeping It All Straight Does anyone else remember a time when you send in a resume and literally count the minutes between the time it was sent and the phone ringing? Well, back in the day, it was just not as difficult to track the old job search. A binder, a spreadsheet, even your Sent Mail folder would do. When I embarked upon my most recent job search, just over a year ago, I realized that none of these methods were quite right. I kept bookmarking job descriptions on the big job boards, only to go back later to find they had been removed. In order to better track the specifics of the jobs I was applying to, I ended up developing a very simple web-based job tracking system where I could store all of the job related information in one place (including the resume and cover letter I sent it), and retrieve it on demand. After using the application for several months, I turned it into a free public job portal so that anyone can use it. With all of the job related web sites out there, I'm surprised that no one has done this until now. The closest thing I've seen has been on private career center sites which provide some job search tools for their paid clientele. Other than that, there are some sites that let you track the jobs you applied to through their interface, but none of them let you track all of your job inquiries, regardless of source. If you've seen anything else like it out there, please let me know. Also, if you'd like to share how you're tracking your current job search, please add a comment below.

 urlLink Should You Tell Your Employer That You Have AD/HD? The urlLink previous post is one of many examples that show that having ADHD affects how one performs in the workplace. This article explains, with specific examples, that it may or may not be in one's best interest to disclose to an employer: The answer is, it depends on the facts of the individual case. Generally, we recommend disclosure of AD/HD to an employer if (1) you can document AD/HD, and AD/HD is a disability under the law in your case, (2) you are qualified for the job, and (3) you need job accommodations that are reasonable. The writers share instances when you should not disclose ADHD along with when and how to disclose.

 urlLink Guidelines for Succeeding in the Workplace with AD/HD crossposted to urlLink Journey Inside My Mind This document, provided by the National Resource Center on AD|HD, a program of urlLink CHADD (Children and Adults with Attention Deficit Disorder) , is an excellent resource for individuals such as myself, who deal with the symptoms of AD/HD every day. The entire guide is available for downloading as a urlLink PDF file , too. The symptoms of AD/HD create special challenges for the adult in the workplace, just as they do for the child in school. To date, very little research has been conducted that provides adults with AD/HD empirically-based approaches to understanding and coping with workplace issues. Until scientifically-based guidelines are available, it may prove useful to follow the procedures commonly used by career counselors to guide individuals in selecting a job and coping with AD/HD on the job. This information and resource sheet will: offer tips for improving on-the-job functioning describe the rights of individuals under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 provide guidelines for making career choices The assistance of a career counselor or a psychologist, social worker, or other health care worker with career counseling training is extremely helpful in understanding and maximizing these factors. Some individuals, however, may be able to carry out the steps discussed in this information and resource sheet with the help of questionnaires, checklists, and suggestions given in the career counseling books on the reference list.

 urlLink Jobs Growth in Nov. Slower Than Expected While that doesn't sound too encouraging by itself, I'd like to point to these paragraphs from the article: The jobs market has been a weak link in the recovery, with companies hesitant to hire new, full-time workers out of concern that the improvements wouldn't last. Instead, employers worked their employees longer and harder, sending productivity to a two-decade high last quarter. In Friday's jobs report, the services sector continued to drive employment gains, with health care and social services jumping by 25,000 in November. Hotels and lodging facilities created 13,000 new positions. Hiring also occurred in education, government and professional and business services. In the goods-producing category, construction employment was up last month by 10,000. Articles such as these are meant to describe overall trends, from a macroeconomic perspective. Jobs are available, and your particular circumstances may or may not be affected by what's reported nationally. Go Get That Job!

 Wanted: Your Job Hunting Success Stories However it is that you got to this weblog, I'm encouraged that you've stopped by. Hopefully, you'll find what you're looking for. Now, let me take this moment to ask you for something. I want to let others know about how you have successfully found a job. This may sound odd, especially if you're currently between jobs. Nevertheless, you probably have had a job before, and I (and I'm sure that many others) would like to know how you got it. It may be your current one or a previous one - it doesn't matter. I want to encourage other job seekers with your success. You will receive no reimbursement from this, except for the gratification that your story has helped to inspire countless others who are where you once were. Be specific, but don't mention any company names. That may sound like a contradiction in terms, and you may disagree with this approach - let me know and I may reconsider. Instead, use a generic title, such as "software development consulting company", "global consumer products company", and so on. If you would like some help, then let me know. I will only use your initials or first name and last initial when presenting your success story. I am specifically interested in answers to the following: What position were you applying for? How did you contact the particular company? Describe the interviewing process. Did you work part-time or as a contractor/consultant with the company before being hired? How long was the process from your first contact with the company to your first day of work? Describe your emotional state during the process. Were you anxious? Excited? Stressed? Impatient? Frustrated? Let us know. So email me your job hunting success stories at danimal0416[nospam]@yahoo.com(remove the [nospam], of course), and we'll get them published here at "Get That Job!" Thanks!

 urlLink WetFeet.com > How to Answer Resume-Based Questions Recruiters love to ask all candidates, from undergraduates to mid-career, about their resume. These questions give an interviewer a chance to dig a little deeper into your background and at the same time test your critical thinking abilities. The questions also give you a chance to show the interviewer your confidence, competence, and enthusiasm about a project or job you really understand. Because resume questions take the discussion to your home turf, there isn't really a secret recipe for pulling apart the question. The way to be successful here is to follow a few basic interview rules.

 urlLink MSN Careers - Believe It or Not! - Career Advice Article How far would you go to land your next job? For most, it depends on how badly they need a job. As a career counselor, I've had the opportunity to hear about many amazing and often outrageous stories involving people employing extreme strategies to find suitable work. Many of the stories may sound unbelievable to you, but they are all true... ...This is what happened to six people desperate for work and at their wits' end. These stories are about regular people just like you and me who took control of their destiny to achieve a goal. Although these stories are intriguing and highly creative, I do not recommend following these examples as a means of finding employment. They provide the kind of "out-of-the-box" thinking required for becoming employed in a tough job market. I hope you will glean from them the inspiration to escape the anxiety of being in transition and instead devote your energies to a creative self-marketing that goes beyond the pages of a resume...

 Tip of the Day: Blog your way to Job Search success! (Original post is located urlLink here .) While there are many blogging tools out there, I find that I have become very fond of the free urlLink BLOGGER service for most of my blogging needs, ever since urlLink Google acquired them and added the Blog button to the urlLink Google Toolbar . What this does is allow you to add web pages, with comments, directly to your blog from whatever site you are on with the push of a button. For example, suppose you see a job listing in your local newsgroup. The logical thing to do would be to go to the employer's site and see whether or not the job is listed there. Now here's where Blogging can come in handy. Say you are ready to apply for the job immediately - it's easy enough just to send in your resume and store all of the information in your Jobfiler job tracker. But suppose you aren't ready to apply - you need to revise your resume, or get your cover letter in order, or simply think about it. If you had a job search related Blog, you would simply blog that page, add whatever notes you want to associate with that job, and post it to your blog. Your blog would then become a running job search diary, which you can even add follow up comments to any single entry. Some things to consider... if you are blogging your job search for your own records, it's important to set up the blog as PRIVATE (not publically available). Of course, there are folks who blog their search publically, but that's really a judgement call on your part. Anything you post in the public domain could come back to bite you. Read this article on Blogger about the guy that got fired over his blog. How-To's (skip this if you're not trying to set your blog to Private) When you urlLink create your account on Blogger , you can specify whether the blog is public or private. If you mark it as "Private" and want to keep it that way, you should also add the robots meta tag in the header of your template (and if you FTP to your own directory, placing the robots.txt file in the root is also a good idea). And of course, set your options on Blogger to Ping Weblogs = No. Here are some sample jobsearch blogs which I have found on the web: urlLink Trey's Job Search urlLink All About Jen urlLink Mike McBride: Life of a one-man IT Department On a related note, here are some jobsearch information blogs, offering advice, articles, etc. urlLink The Job Files urlLink http://bostonworks.boston.com/blog/ urlLink Not Working for a Living urlLink The Monster Blog urlLink Being Bold And for those of you who would like an alternative solution to Blogger, here are some other ways to get your blog up and running in a short amount of time: urlLink BBlog urlLink Square Space urlLink eBloggy Good luck, and happy hunting!

 urlLink BW Online | December 2, 2003 | U.S. Programmers at Overseas Salaries He could have used subcontractors in India, but he decided to keep the work at home but at the same price. Jon Carson's cMarket has solved its immediate challenge, the implications of Jon's approach are potentially mind-bending. What if other companies begin taking the same approach -- offering Indian-style wages to American workers? On the positive site, we could begin to solve our job-creation problems. But on the negative side, America's standard of living would inevitably decline. There's only one way to find out for sure how it all might shake out, and that is for other executives to replicate Jon's experiment. The results could be quite interesting.

 urlLink Right Job, Wrong Job - Personality test to find the right career for you Tickle, by eMode, is a social networking web site that is chock full of personality tests (like what kind of dog you would be if you were a dog, of course), including this one on finding the career that's right for you. The career test does return your personality type, although it wasn't as specific as I expected it to be. For example, it told me that I should get a job that allows me to be Analytical and Creative (no surprise there), but didn't tell me specifically which jobs fit that bill. Apparently, to get a list of jobs, I would have to request (purchase) their Personalized Career Report for $14.95. So, while the site can be a kick (and a break from the day-to-day of your job search), I don't recommend giving them a dime. Unless of course, you're just looking to squander some money on the web (then, boy, do I have some web sites for you!) ;-p

 urlLink CAREERS NOW: ORGANIZE HUNT WITH NEW FREE SERVICE Jobfiler was mentioned today by syndicated columnist, Joyce Lain Kennedy in her "Careers Now" column. Kennedy has been an authority on employment for the last three decades. Her Q&A column provides advice on jobs and career development, addressing common work-related problems: demotion, layoffs, discrimination, specialization, keeping up with technology and networking at trade conventions. Here is an excerpt from what Joyce had to say about Jobfiler.com: NEW FREE ORGANIZER . A hard-charging job search generates scores of contacts each week. Effective follow-up depends upon keeping your records straight - contacts, names, dates, pitches, interviews, thank-you notes, previous follow-up and so forth. Accessible records help you maintain memory of resources where you've had better than average success - somewhat like finding a store that carries clothing you like and where you want to return to shop. Until now, books with blank worksheets to photocopy were the norm. No more. I've been keeping an eye peeled for a free online and public tool (not a tool restricted to clients of outsourcing consultants or for-fee Web sites). Happily, such a tool has materialized: urlLink Jobfiler.com .

 urlLink Yahoo! News - Consumer Sentiment Highest Since Nov 2000 I think I understand it now. Evidence shows that the tax cuts passed by Congress and signed into law by President Bush have been good for the economy and job seekers. As consumer sentiment gets better, the demand for goods and services grows. The higher demand for goods and services means that companies work to provide for those demands. This means investing money into hiring new workers, for one thing. From the article (emphasis added): The confidence data helped ease worries that the labor market's slow recovery might undermine consumer spending, which makes up two-thirds of economic activity in the United States. Consumers' hearty spending over the past few years, helped by tax cuts and low interest rates, has helped keep the economy from suffering a sharper downturn . Economists said a variety of factors likely boosted confidence: the holidays passing without any attacks, the rise in stock indexes to nearly two-year highs, coming tax refunds and an end to big layoffs.

 "I still don't know what I want to be when I grow up." I made that statement yesterday at a gathering of other job seekers at urlLink Sinclair Community College . A brief history of my education and experience: I have a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering I was an Environmental Engineer doing environmental management for a manufacturing company I was a programmer/consultant I am a bartender for a hotel and conference center I remember when I met with the guidance counselor in high school, he told me that he could see me doing a number of different kinds of jobs, based on the talents and aptitude he'd seen in me. I had dreamed of becoming a Renaissance Man back then. I don't know if I've found something that fits just yet. To quote urlLink U2 , "I still haven't found what I'm looking for." At the same time, I realize that no job is going to be a perfect fit. There are always going to be times when the passion wanes, when there is other "non-fun" work to be done, too. I guess it's a matter of seeing whether the benefits outweigh the costs, evaluating the trade-offs. For example, I have a friend who designs cars for a major automobile company. He loves that part of his job so much that he is able to live with the long hours and the long drive to and from work. I guess I want to find something in-between, too. crossposted to urlLink Journey Inside My Mind

 urlLink Don't ever stop your networking [another Marvin Walberg article] The main point of this article is that you should constantly network instead of relying on "911 Networking," the kind that often occurs when someone loses a job. Walberg recommends a book by Diane Darling, entitled The Networking Survival Guide. I've added it to my list of favorite books so that I'll know to check it out later (I maintain a list of what I'm currently reading via urlLink AllConsuming.net , and you can view the list at my homepage, " urlLink Dan's Domain ."). Constant networking may mean that jobs come looking for you.

 When You Don't Know Anybody What if you recently moved to a new city or town and don't know anybody with whom to network? After all, networking is key to getting a job. urlLink Marvin Walberg recommends volunteer work and special interest groups . I'm not sure whether the link I've referenced above is going to last, so allow me to do some pasting from the article: Volunteering is a wonderful way to meet new people, demonstrate workplace skills, network like crazy and get the good feeling of helping others. And every community needs volunteers. How do you find out what's available in the world of volunteering in your city? Go to your main public library, chamber of commerce or any hospital system. You will find a plethora of opportunities, and from a "building your resume" perspective, volunteer work is work and counts in the experience column. It really doesn't matter that you do it for free. Everyone has interests aside from the workaday world. How about you? Do you like bowling, bird watching, table tennis or wood carving? In most cities you can obtain a listing of special interest groups at your public library. Understand that networking is universal. Just because someone knows nothing about what you do for a living doesn't mean he or she can't lead you to others who do. Just be prepared to introduce yourself and give a clear, understandable explanation of what you do, or want to do, for a living. Then, show up for meetings and smile. The rest will happen almost automatically.

 Staying Employed While You're Searching for a New Job Everyone knows it's easier to find a job when you already have one. So, even if your job is a miserable one, plog away as long as you can while you're looking for something better. Be smart about how you go about looking for a job, unless you really just don't care whether or not your current employer finds out. 1. If you are searching for jobs on the Internet from your work computer, do yourself a favor and keep your activities private by using a free proxy service like urlLink The Cloak . 2. Don't use your work email account to send resumes from (I know this sounds obvious, but you'd be surprised how many people do this!), and if you must give out a daytime number, use a cell phone or answering service. 3. Posting your resume online can be tricky, if you don't want your current employer to pull you up in a candidate search. It's much better to not post your resume publicly, and also be careful about sending in resumes to anonymous employers (yes, I've heard of people sending in resumes for their own jobs - it's not pretty!) 4. Track your job search using portable media, like urlLink Jobfiler , or a notebook you can carry with you. That way you don't have records on your work computer which indicate you've been searching. 5. Whatever else you do, don't publicly broadcast your job search in a Blog or Discussion Board posts, unless you are fully prepared for the consequences. People have been fired over less. Good luck with your job search!

 Insider Information: Good News! Job Search Expenses Are Deductible in the U.S. By Harry Collias, H&R Block Tax Specialist Expenses incurred in the course of searching for a new job can be a deduction against your taxable income. The Internal Revenue Service has laid down some rules and erected at least one hurdle, but the deduction can make a difference in your final tax bill. Many job seekers are unaware of this tax benefit; here's how you can take advantage of it. First, the Rules: You can deduct certain unreimbursed expenses you incur in looking for a new job, whether or not you are unemployed at the time of the job search, and whether or not you land a new job. You cannot deduct job search expenses if: You are looking for a job in a new occupation, or There has been a substantial break between the ending of your last job and your looking for a new one, or You are looking for a job for the first time. If you pass the "cannot" rules, then you can deduct Employment and outplacement agency fees. Costs of typing, printing, and mailing copies of your resume. Phone and fax expenses, including long distance calls to prospects. Travel and transportation expenses if you have to travel outside your home territory to look for, or interview for, a job. The trip must be primarily to look for a job. The term "primarily" refers to the amount of personal activity on the trip compared to the amount of time you spend in looking for work. Even if you cannot justify deduction of travel expenses you can still deduct the expenses of looking for a job while in the area. If you drive you can deduct the standard mileage rate of 36 cents per mile. Second, the hurdle: Job search expenses are classified as "miscellaneous itemized deductions." This class of deductions (which include union dues, work clothes, and tax prep fees) is only deductible from your income if you itemize deductions and only to the extent that the total exceeds two percent of your adjusted gross income. Third, some advice: Keep detailed records of your expenses, in case of audit, and never include expenses for which you have been reimbursed by your prospective employer. Copyright 2004 Harry Collias.

 Who You Are - Self-Assessment, etc. Today, while looking through some career assessment documents I'd worked on a few years back, I found some characteristics from my Myers-Briggs Type Indicator profile (I'm an ENFJ, by the way): Natural motivator even when people initially don't want to do something Outwardly focused toward others Highly skilled in understanding others' needs and motivations Gift for imagination and inspiration Expresses himself in organized, effective way that allows him to make his imaginative ventures become reality Identifies what the group needs to help it reach its goal Looked to for leadership and decisiveness in a supportive climate Sincerity and concern are driving force and motivation Highly articulate, with excellent social skills and a quick sense of humor Sizes up a situation intuitively and, in a very caring and concerned way, says just the right thing Communicates organization's values Brings strong ideals of how organizations should treat people Enjoys leading and facilitating teams Encourages cooperation Likes to bring matters to fruitful conclusions Leads through personal enthusiasm Takes a participative stance in managing people and projects Responsive to followers' needs Challenges the organization to make actions congruent with values Inspires change The MBTI is just one of a number of ways that you can learn more about yourself.

 Job Search Links [via email from Mark Carey] I received this email from Mark Carey recently, and I wanted to pass the information along to fellow job seekers: Hi Dan, I not applying to become a contributor, as I don't feel that I would be able to meet the "post regularly" rule. But I do want to let you know of a couple of new web sites that you may want to talk about in your blog: urlLink Career MetaSearch - urlLink http://www.careermetasearch.com A new job search site that focuses exclusively on employer-only postings (no recruiters). urlLink Job Search Blogs - urlLink http://www.jobsearchblogs.com Just two days old, this site offers free blogs to job seekers. I believe that blogs can really act as an extended resume, showing employers a lot more than a boring resume. A community aspect of the site is planned: an aggregated view of all bloggers' entries in a forum-like view, enabling job seekers to discuss their job search efforts. I am developing the second site for a client (Career MetaSearch, the first link above). If you feel that either or both of these sites are worthy of mention, it would be greatly appreciated to help get the word out (addition to your blogroll would be great too, of course :) ) Alternatively, I could write a "one time" article about Job Search Blogs, if that interests you. Regards, Mark Ps. Great blog! Thanks, Mark, for the information!

 What Career Choices Do ENFJs Make? ENFJ is one of the sixteen Myers-Briggs Types. I'm an ENFJ. For more information on what this means specifically, you can check out this urlLink web page . You could also search it in your favorite search engine; there's a Google search utility on this blog, as a matter of fact. I belong to an ENFJ email group, and the following message was sent out recently: I am in between jobs and wanted to know what other people do for a living. I am also very interested in whether you consider this to be your passion or a career or a just a job. Thanks. As I began to read the replies, I thought that it would be useful to post them here. Here's one: The basic tread of ENFJs is a quest to teach. Even though I don't teach professionally now, I am always learning stuff so I can teach. I did teach classical piano for 15 years but grew to hate it because while I did have good and exceptional students from time to time, most were just being enriched by their wealthy parents. Below is a list of my life's work experience. Please do not think of me as a jack of all trades and master of none because that is not true. I just get bored after awhile and want something new. I have been blessed with the ability to change professions, for example, after fifteen years in the auto business becoming the top salesman for Ford in New Jersey, New York and PA, I started taking lessons on the piano and went on to a full time career in music. 1. Movie Usher. 2. Construction worker. ( Under my father ) 3. Heavy machinery driver. ( Florida Turnpike ) 4. Radar Operator US Army. 5. Radio Operator US Army. 6. Supply Seargent US Army. 7. Auto Salesman. 8. Auto Parts Department Manager. 9. Auto Service Department Manager. 10. Auto Sales Manager. 11. Piano Teacher. 12. Piano Tuner. 13. Pianist. 14. Accountant. 15. Real Estate Salesman. 16. Insurance Salesman. 17. Computer programmer. 18. Investigator for State Police. 19. Stock and Bond Investor Interesting. Here's another reply: I'm so drawn to teaching that after only three years of being a High School teacher I've put my hand up for having a prac teacher from the local uni. So now I teach the kids and help a new teacher learn how to teach. It's quite an addiction! High School teaching is a passion, but not necessarily a career. Like [a previous person mentioned] I see myself getting itchy in a few years. I've always fancied going off to Bible College and becoming the pastor of a church. But I'm scared my heart will be too much in it, which would be very dangerous if things went poorly. Yet another ENFJ replies: My first thought on this subject was "career choice?" I don't feel that I was able to make a career choice. I kind of fell into my line of work. I did extremely well in Office Education in high school (but I probably would have done well in other subjects--it was a VERY small school and there were very few programs available outside of the regular curriculum), and when I needed to make money after I graduated I secured an administrative assistant position at the refinery which was our small town's primary employer. I worked while I went to the local junior college. Soon I was married and we moved to a slightly larger town so my husband could attend a university. Of course, the dutiful wife (I score spades in dutiful), the primary income generation fell to me. An agency got me an interview with a large bank and after working in various departments I was promoted to receptionist in the trust department, where the Sr. VP and trust officer happened to also be an attorney. My husband, the gypsy, moved us all over and it seemed that one thing led to another, always working for attorneys, because the work was the highest paying clerical work. (Meanwhile every attempt of mine to go to college was thwarted by said husband...now my ex!) And I *was* a very good secretary, anticipating the needs of my bosses (and attorneys are VERY needy), well organized, proficient. But I was a secretary. I found it extremely demeaning, because I knew I was capable of so much more. Now, I find myself LOVING my job at a lawfirm--because I am allowed to be SO MUCH MORE! I am still a legal secretary, but also a legal technologist, handling the technical needs of the firm. My goal is for the job to work into full time technology, and I think it is a reasonable assumption that it is just a matter of time. And believe it or not, I like have the secretarial work when I am experiencing information overload and I need to process or just to do something at which I excel. I have always been appreciated in my jobs, but I have never felt fulfilled until now. I have been a "job hopper" because I "still hadn't found what I was looking for" to coin a U2 lyric! I, and I suspect others of my type (ENFJ), needed variety and to feel that I added unique value. Now I get to do many different things, have lots to learn, many challenges, and I have found the right environment (jeans, relaxed atmosphere, great coworkers). I notice that I am learning not to take things personally, that I no longer expect to win every battle and indeed that some things are not battles anyway. For instance, I asked for business cards, but the firm does not provide business cards to anyone but attorneys and paralegals. I will just print my own and eventually I'm sure I will get firm cards, I realize they have never had anyone in this position and are not ready to set this precedent. I think all of the personal growths I am recognizing are really just due to wisdom, which has come with my advancing years. I don't make top dollar, but thanks to my husband I don't have to anymore. I know this is way more than you wanted to know, but I've waxed eloquent on other occasions about how dissatisfied I was with my occupation, and I just wanted to share what a great change has occurred. I still feel that it resulted because of circumstances (which I attribute to God) and I'm so grateful! I don't think it is bad, obviously, to keep changing and hunting and striving for the ideal. (That said, I didn't get a lot of interviews due to my poor tenure!)

 Thanks! urlLink Jen gave us some encouraging comments recently: I just wanted to commend the creators on a wonderful job with this blog. I graduated from a prestigious university in 2003, spent 6 months job searching before I finally found something that I was content with. Unfortunately that was temporary, and then I ended up with another temp job, and the owner turned out to be a complete psycho (i filed harassment against him, and he hasn't paid me for the last month that I worked -- and it's been 2 months now). Anyways, to the person who just completed their 500th resume... I feel your pain. Unemployment is awful -- especially when you're not eligible for unemployment benefits and you can't pay your rent. *sigh* Alright I'm ending it here... feel free to visit my blog-- there's been a lot of job-search related frustrations lately. :) GoodLuck!

 Hi Bert, I saw your blog note. 500 jobs. Wow, that's a lot. What kind of job are you looking for? What methods are you using to find a job? How much time per day do you spend on finding a new job?

Now, granted my job search has been on and off for about a year and a half now (with time off for good behavior of course, and contracts here and there). And I have turned down a few jobs to date that were not a good fit for me, either organizationally, economically, or idealogically. Nontheless, 500 jobs is an awful lot of jobs to be applying to, even when the economy is somewhat depressed. And speaking of depressed...

 Crew Worker in the Midst "If you have a job without aggravation, you don't have a job." -- urlLink Malcolm Forbes I've begun to settle in at work, it seems. There are some aspects of it that I enjoy, that are really good for the "high stimulus" craving I have. Other aspects I could do without; namely, the politics, the inconsistencies in following procedures. The inconsistencies in following procedures is something I'm figuring out how to live with. I liken my behavior to a detective who doesn't always "go by the book" on things and yet still accomplishes the organization's overall goal.

 That's right, gentle readers. I want to let others know about how you have successfully found a job. It may be your current one or a previous one - it doesn't matter. I want to encourage other job seekers with your success. You will receive no reimbursement from this, except for the gratification that your story has helped to inspire countless others who are where you once were. Be specific, but don't mention any company names. That may sound like a contradiction in terms, and you may disagree with this approach - let me know and I may reconsider. Instead, use a generic title, such as "software development consulting company", "global consumer products company", and so on. If you would like some help, then let me know. I will only use your initials or first name and last initial when presenting your success story. I am specifically interested in answers to the following: What position were you applying for? How did you contact the particular company? Describe the interviewing process. Did you work part-time or as a contractor/consultant with the company before being hired? How long was the process from your first contact with the company to your first day of work? Describe your emotional state during the process. Were you anxious? Excited? Stressed? Impatient? Frustrated? Let us know. So email me your job hunting success stories at danimal0416 AT gmail.com (replace the " AT " with the "@", of course), and we'll get these published here at "Get That Job!"

 While there are a few legitimate companies out there that do charge jobseekers a fee for their services, it is my firm belief that 90% of the job search sites that ask job seekers for money are to be approached with a very large grain of caution. Here is an article about a recent experience I had with a bogus job site, and some tips on how to watch out for, and protect yourself from, job site scams. urlLink click here to read entire article on Jobfiler.com

 (My Yahoo! Daily Tip) by Caroline Levchuck You can remake yourself on the job. But first you have to stop the real (or imagined) problem behavior. First, identify what's holding you back. Do you regularly miss deadlines? Are you defensive with your manager or argumentative with coworkers? Are you reluctant to take on new tasks? Once you've admitted to yourself that you need to improve your performance, you have to admit it to your manager. Meet with your boss and share how you want to improve. Ask for feedback on what kind of behavior she'd like to see and ask for her support. Come up with a schedule to check in regularly and discuss your improvement. If you want further help, talk to the human resource department. HR often has tools to help employees who are struggling, including job coaching and counseling.

 The number of workers getting fired for violating e-mail policies is rising as companies face more subpoenas of e-mail records, according to a new poll. Twenty-five percent of companies terminated a worker for violating e-mail policies, up from 22 percent last year, according to the poll. Employees who get fired often are sending messages that violate a company's e-mail policy regarding content, such as messages with inappropriate language or photos. Another common mistake: using the company e-mail system for personal messages. urlLink General Career News

 Since I began this blog two years ago, the template (layout, design, etc.) has not changed that much. I feel that it's time to take advantage of more flexibility that the Blogger folks have provided and update the template. So, in the not-too-distant future, look for this blog to have a different look. I've already set it up so that each post has a title and link field, and I've enabled Blogger comments. In addition, I need to update/upgrade the blogroll. I created the blogroll you currently see at a time when users of the Blogrolling.com basic service were able to have multiple blogrolls. Since the folks over there have changed the service, they graciously still provide the blogroll, but I'm unable to make changes to it. If none of this makes any sense to you, then that's okay. The bottom line is that we're making some changes to this blog, which I hope are for the better! Take care and go get that job!

Career coaches can help people to create and carry out plans related to their life and career goals. They can assist with resume preparation and job searches, guide people toward suitable industries or fields, or help resolve specific career challenges that are holding them back. With the number of career coaches out there, it can be daunting to try to find the right one to work with. To help in this process, we've added a urlLink coaches database to Jobfiler.com.

 Job Search Tip: Set up automated job search agents Looking at the lead sources you have targeted for your job search, these sources most likely include job banks, classifieds, recruiters, discussion lists, newsgroups, etc. Select a number of key sites that you feel would be of assistance, and set up automated job search agents to search for you daily/weekly and email you the results. This ensures that you are not missing any key job postings, and also gives you an action item first thing every morning (review the jobs that have been emailed to you and respond to the ones that are interesting). Setting up job search agents is a free and easy way to give yourself an edge in your job search. Some of the sites that I recommend looking at and setting up automated agents for include: urlLink Monster.com urlLink Career Builder urlLink HotJobs.com Once you have your agents set up, it's merely a matter of staying on top of reviewing and responding to the postings as they come in. If you are tracking your job search using urlLink JobFiler or another job search organizer , you can also get a sense for which sites are bringing you the best leads over time, as well as which job sites are posting the same old tired jobs, week after week. For more job search tips and advice, check out urlLink Jobfiler's job search support forums , where you can post your job search related question in our Q&A section and have your question answered by a professional career coach.

 Help Make Blogs More Visible! NOTE: Be sure you paste live links for the Path List below. There are by some estimates more than a million weblogs. But most of them get no visibility in search engines. Only a few "A-List" blogs get into the top search engine results for a given topic, while the majority of blogs just don't get noticed. The reason is that the smaller blogs don't have enough links pointing to them. But this posting could solve that. Let's help the smaller blogs get more visibility! This posting is urlLink GoMeme 4.0 . It is part of an experiment to see if we can create a blog posting that helps 1000's of blogs get higher rankings in Google. So far we have tried 3 earlier variations. Our first test, urlLink GoMeme 1.0 , spread to nearly 740 blogs in 2.5 days. This new version 4.0 is shorter, simpler, and fits more easily into your blog. Why are we doing this? We want to help thousands of blogs get more visibility in Google and other search engines. How does it work? Just follow the instructions below to re-post this meme in your blog and add your URL to the end of the Path List below. As the meme spreads onwards from your blog, so will your URL. Later, when your blog is indexed by search engines, they will see the links pointing to your blog from all the downstream blogs that got this via you, which will cause them to rank your blog higher in search results. Everyone in the Path List below benefits in a similar way as this meme spreads. Try it! Instructions: Just copy this entire post and paste it into your blog.

 To: National Desk Contact: Dirk Fillpot of the U.S. Department of Labor, 202-693-4676 HAMMOND, La., Aug. 3 /U.S. Newswire/ -- U.S. Secretary of Labor Elaine L. Chao told the Louisiana Economic Forum that President Bush's leadership and sound economic policies have led to strong job growth in Louisiana and across America, and that the Administration's commitment to reforming training and employment programs will help workers find and prepare for new job opportunities in the growing economy. "Nationally, this is the 10th straight month of job growth," Secretary of Labor Elaine L. Chao said in the Forum's keynote address at Southeastern Louisiana University. "More than 1.5 million new jobs have been created since last August. The national unemployment rate is now 5.6 percent, which is lower than the average unemployment rate of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s." The steady and consistent growth in the national economy is evident in Louisiana, Secretary Chao noted. Louisiana's unemployment rate has dropped a full percentage point since June of last year. Louisiana added 5,900 jobs in June, across a broad range of sectors. Secretary Chao also pointed out that while the economy continues to improve, the Administration is committed to helping workers who are still looking for good, high-paying jobs. "These improvements are good news for Louisiana and for the country. But President Bush and this Administration recognize that there are folks in Louisiana who still need help. The Department of Labor has tremendous resources available to help workers who are looking for jobs, transitioning between jobs or upgrading their skills," Chao said. Some of the services available to job seekers include job training and counseling. Workers can also receive help paying for transportation, child-care expenses and health insurance premiums while looking for work. Louisiana alone receives $132.8 million annually from the U.S. Department of Labor for training and employment services. Chao also encouraged workers in need of assistance to visit one of 19 Comprehensive One-Stop Career Centers in Louisiana. Workers can find the nearest center at urlLink http://www.servicelocator.org . via urlLink U.S. Newswire

 "Tonight, when you lay your head on your pillow, forget how far you still have to go. Look instead at how far you've already come." -- Bob Moawad: It is so easy for me to get discouraged sometimes when I think about all that I didn't get done today. What I really need to remind myself of is how much I have done. "May the road rise up to meet you. May the wind be at your back. May your mission in life feed your passion like no other." -- Unknown: Amen! "Often intuition will direct you. If it feels right, it's probably right." -- Oprah Winfrey: This one I don't completely agree with because it might feel right, for example, for me to rob a bank. In that case following my intuition is a bad idea. I believe it is better to sound your ideas off others, who can provide objective opinions.

 "Before we can care for others, we must learn to love the self." -- Drew Leder: It seems that I have to learn this lesson over and over, but I can definitely see the truth. How can I give something to you if I don't have anything to give? I need to take care of myself, to love myself, before I can love others as I love myself. "Let the world know you as you are, not as you think you should be----because sooner or later, if you are posing, you will forget the pose and then where are you?" -- Fanny Brice Aha! Be as you are and you will never have to try to be anyone else. If you're never scared or embarrassed or hurt, it means you never take any chances." -- Julie Sorel: Get out of the boat, just like Peter did when he saw Jesus walking on the water. If you never take any chances then you will never have an opportunity to succeed. Live!

 Comprehending Engineers - Take Nine An engineer was crossing a road one day when a frog called out to him and said, "If you kiss me, I'll turn into a beautiful princess." He bent over, picked up the frog and put it in his pocket. The frog spoke up again and said, "If you kiss me and turn me back into a beautiful princess, I will stay with you for one week." The engineer took the frog out of his pocket, smiled at it and returned it to the pocket. The frog then cried out, "If you kiss me and turn me back into a princess, I'll stay with you and do ANYTHING you want." Again the engineer took the frog out, smiled at it and put it back into his pocket. Finally, the frog asked, "What is the matter? I've told you I'm a beautiful princess, that I'll stay with you for a week and do anything you want. Why won't you kiss me?" The engineer said, "Look I'm an engineer. I don't have time for a girlfriend, but a talking frog......that's cool."

 Comprehending Engineers - Take Eight An architect, an artist and an engineer were discussing whether it was better to spend time with the wife or a mistress. The architect said he enjoyed time with his wife, building a solid foundation for an enduring relationship. The artist said he enjoyed time with his mistress, because the passion and mystery he found there. The engineer said, "I like both." "Both?" Engineer: "Yeah. If you have a wife and a mistress, they will each assume you are spending time with the other woman, and you can go to the lab and get some work done." My wife has become very sensitive to the amount of time I spend on the computer at night.

 Comprehending Engineers - Take Seven "Normal people ... believe that if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Engineers believe that if it ain't broke, it doesn't have enough features yet." Actually, I once destroyed a 1980 Chevette because of this mentality. I tried to install a flush ' n' fill system, and I couldn't get the hoses back on tight enough. While driving on the expressway sometime later, the engine froze. I later found out that this car, for which I had recently poured over $800 worth of repairs to get it running again, had melted pistons!

 Comprehending Engineers - Take Six Three engineering students were gathered together discussing the possible designers of the human body. One said, "It was a mechanical engineer.

Who else would run a toxic waste pipeline through a recreational area?"

 Comprehending Engineers - Take Five The graduate with a Science degree asks, "Why does it work?" The graduate with an Engineering degree asks, "How does it work?" The graduate with an Accounting degree asks, "How much will it cost?" The graduate with an Arts degree asks, "Do you want fries with that?"

 Comprehending Engineers - Take Four What is the difference between Mechanical Engineers and Civil Engineers? Mechanical Engineers build weapons, Civil Engineers build targets.

 Comprehending Engineers - Take Three A pastor, a doctor and an engineer were waiting one morning for a particularly slow group of golfers. The engineer fumed, "What's with these guys? We must have been waiting for 15 minutes!" The doctor chimed in, "I don't know, but I've never seen such ineptitude!" The pastor said, "Hey, here comes the greens keeper. Let's have a word with him." "Hi George. say, what's with that group ahead of us? They're rather slow, aren't they?" The greens keeper replied, "Oh, yes, that's a group of blind firefighters. They lost their sight saving our clubhouse from a fire last year, so we always let them play for free anytime." The group was silent for a moment. The pastor said, "That's so sad. I think I will say a special prayer for them tonight." The doctor said, "Good idea. And I'm going to contact my ophthalmologist buddy and see if there's anything he can do for them." The engineer said, "Why can't these guys play at night?"

 Comprehending Engineers - Take Two To the optimist, the glass is half full. To the pessimist, the glass is half empty. To the engineer, the glass is twice as big as it needs to be.

 Note: I have a Civil Engineering degree from the University of Cincinnati, so I find these very funny. Or maybe it's because I'm a computer programmer now... Comprehending Engineers - Take One Two engineering students were walking across campus when one said, "Where did you get such a great bike?" The second engineer replied, "Well, I was walking along yesterday minding my own business when a beautiful woman rode up on this bike. She threw the bike to the ground, took off all her clothes and said, "Take what you want." The second engineer nodded approvingly, "Good choice; the clothes probably wouldn't have fit."

 Motivation "A ship in a harbor is safe, but that is not what ships are for." - William Shedd: DO something with your life! Make yourself useful. God has given each of us talents to be used to build.

 urlLink Proverbs 24:11, NIV "Rescue those being led away to death; hold back those staggering toward slaughter." Sometime I'll have to share about how someone reached out to me, which eventually resulted in my being rescued from being led away to my "spiritual" death. Until then, it's important to realize that we're not alone - the world does not revolve around me. We must consider others' needs, among them being their spiritual condition.

James Traficant, D-Ohio "None of us ever wants to sit in judgment of our peer.

 I've had this list in my email for quite awhile, and it's time I included it here. - DAJ TWENTY TRUTHS TO LIVE BY Faith is the ability to not panic. If you worry, you didn't pray. If you pray, don't worry. As a child of God, prayer is kind of like calling home every day. Blessed are the flexible, for they shall not be bent out of shape. When we get tangled up in our problems, be still. God wants us to be still so God can untangle the knot. Do the math. Count your blessings. God wants spiritual fruit, not religious nuts. Dear God: I have a problem. It's me. Silence is often misinterpreted, but never misquoted. Laugh every day. It's like inner jogging. The most important things in your home are the people. Growing old is inevitable. Growing up is optional. There is no key to happiness. The door is always open. A grudge is a heavy thing to carry. He who dies with the most toys is still dead. We do not remember days, but moments. Life moves too fast, so enjoy your precious moments. Nothing is real to you until you experience it; otherwise it's just hearsay. It's all right to sit on your pity pot every now and again. Just flush when you are done. Living your life successfully and surviving requires courage. The goals and dreams you're seeking require courage and risk taking. Learn from the turtle -- it only makes progress when it sticks out its neck. Be more concerned with your character than your reputation, because your character is what you really are, while your reputation is merely what others think you are.

 Help Make Blogs More Visible! NOTE: Be sure you paste live links for the Path List below. There are by some estimates more than a million weblogs. But most of them get no visibility in search engines. Only a few "A-List" blogs get into the top search engine results for a given topic, while the majority of blogs just don't get noticed. The reason is that the smaller blogs don't have enough links pointing to them. But this posting could solve that. Let's help the smaller blogs get more visibility! This posting is urlLink GoMeme 4.0 . It is part of an experiment to see if we can create a blog posting that helps 1000's of blogs get higher rankings in Google.

 OK, So It's Not Bipolar.. I went to my new psychiatrist today for the first time. He had read my history and talked about a lot of stuff. He tends to believe that I have Depression and some ADD/ADHD symptoms. I'm going to take this test related to the ADD/ADHD stuff and see how I score. Doc seems to think I'll score high for ADD/ADHD. Also, I'm having to change my meds, which I don't mind that much. One of the side effects of the Depakote is weight gain. Since I've been on it, I've gained about 30 lbs. So I'm looking forward to not having that. I'm increasing my dose of Wellbutrin, and gradually moving off the Effexor-XR and on Celexa. I felt really great after the appointment because it was as though I'm getting a better understanding of who I am. I can get messed up about having these disorders, and when other things go awry in my life, I'm not always able to tell whether it's the disorder or some other weakness in my character. Well, heck. I've gotta get home to my lovely wife and beautiful daughter.

 Learning Grammar Keisha came home from preschool today and showed Jennie a piece of paper. Her class practiced tracing their names. When Jennie asked her whose name was on the paper, she replied, "Keisha's." Jennie then tried to correct her by getting her to be grammatically correct and say "No, it's my name." Keisha responded, "No, Mommy. It's Keisha's !"

 What's New? I've updated the website to include some new urlLink pictures of Keisha. I've added archive pages to this urlLink journal. 6/8/2003, Update: I updated the links to reflect the new location of the journal at BlogSpot.

 Dreams Been having some interesting dreams lately. Unfortunately, I can't remember all the details. In one dream I needed to be at a certain bus stop or something like that, so that I could take an important trip somewhere. It's really hard to put all the details down, because they are racing through my head.

 I've been researching a little on self-injury, because I pick at scabs to make them bleed. The main site I've found is for the urlLink American Self-Harm Information Clearinghouse . I currently have a big scab on my face to the lower right of my mouth. It's really itchy, and it hurts. Since this morning, I've been able to keep from picking at it. Sometimes, like when I'm in the shower, I've used the razor to cut it. Typically, it starts out as something small and eventually becomes big. I've used hydrogen peroxide to help clean it, and some anti-bacterial ointment to help keep it moist. When the scab on my face gets dry, it becomes really itchy and painful, like it is now.

 Went to see the LISW today. An LISW is a Licensed Independent Social Worker, who, in essence, is a psychologist. Unlike a psychiatrist, he cannot prescribe medication. It went very well. I have urlLink Bipolar Disorder and urlLink Obsessive Compulsive Disorder . I think I may delve into this more at a later time.

 Justifiable Use of Force Today is Martin Luther King, Jr.'s birthday. As many know, he was a civil rights activist that worked for peace through nonviolent means. Are there any times when violence is right? What a difficult question to answer. Ever since the terrorist attacks on the US last year, I have believed that it is necessary to use force. We gave the Taliban time to turn over Osama bin Laden, and they let it run out. As a result, we dropped bombs on them. On a much smaller scale, I think about times when my wife and I must discipline our daughter. We have set up boundaries and expectations for her. When she goes outside of those boundaries, we have a moral obligation to discipline her, so that she can learn to respect authority. Sometimes, then, we need to spank her. Other times we remove priveleges. I believe that the United States and its allies have taken a similar approach in the war on terrorism. Basically, President Bush has stated that terrorists will be disciplined for their acts of terror. Financial assets have been frozen. Also, we've used military force. Thus, I see our current situation as one in which the use of force is justified. The principle is the same in law enforcement. A police officer tells a gun-wielding suspect to drop his or her weapon. If he or she does not, then in some cases, the officer may have to use deadly force. What do you think? Feel free to urlLink drop me a line.

 Library book returned, 57 years overdue STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- A rare 17th-century book in Latin has been returned to a Penn State library 57 years after it was last checked out. The good news is there won't be any late fees. This might be me. I am notorious for having overdue items from the library.

 The local paper is having a short story contest, and I'm considering entering it. I wrote one in middle school, but that was a long time ago, so I'm a little out of practice with it. I've written poetry and some other things, but not a short story. I don't even know why I'm saying this. It's as though I'm already believing that I can't do it! How faithless! Now, I just need an idea...

 Music is like an elixir to our souls I have an eclectic taste in music. Depending on the situation, I will listen to anything from smooth jazz to speed metal, and just about anything in between. Music is a universal language of emotion, mood, and message. Thank God for it!

 Feeling much better now. The meds have kicked in. I'm taking 225 mg of Effexor-XR, 750 mg of Depakote, and 100 mg of Wellbutrin.

 Hi. I'm feeling incredibly depressed right now, to the point of tears. I don't know exactly where it's coming from. Perhaps that we're into the new year and I don't have a clear vision for what I want to accomplish. Part of me doesn't want to go through with it at all - just stay where I am (as though that would really make me feel better). I don't know. I am prone to depression, and I take medicine to help alleviate it. I took my meds about 15 minutes ago, so I'm waiting for them to kick in. You know, when a depressive episode kicks in, I really hate that I have it. It feels frustrating, as though I'm out of control of what's going on. I just look forward to it passing.

 Misc Jottings, Mind Leakage, Etc. Funny... I just realized that I forgot to publish my last post. Kinda like when you forget to save a document before your computer crashes. Man, I hate when that happens! Anyhow, I'm glad that some of the changes to the website are working, and I'm encouraged that friends and family are visiting. Next, I need to learn how to link to other weblogs. And, after that, work on world peace (just kidding!).

 Looking at other folks weblogs inspires me. It's neat how some folks have integrated this into their own websites.

 OK. I've made some changes to how this looks, and I'm going to see the results.

 Can You Say 'OOPS'? Check this out, excerpted from a spot in the NY Post yesterday: January 8, 2002 -- CNN yanks 'sexy' Paula spot IN a wacky attempt to stave off the ratings onslaught of rival Fox News Channel, CNN went bonkers over the weekend by shamelessly promoting mother-of-three anchor Paula Zahn as "sexy." Media-watchers were startled when a racy commercial for Zahn's show, "American Morning with Paula Zahn," ran on CNN over the weekend. "Where can you find a morning news anchor who's provocative, super-smart, oh, yeah, and just a little sexy?" a male announcer asked during the 20-second spot. The word "sexy" flashed in red letters and an image of the well-coiffed blond anchor popped up on screen. The ad was pulled yesterday morning. Walter Isaacson, chairman and CEO of CNN's Newsgroup, groaned in a statement: "It was a major blunder by our promotions department. The ad was never seen or approved by anyone outside of the promo department. ------

 Greetings, folks! I am working on the format of this journal, so that it will appear more like the other pages within our web site. I am still somewhat new to HTML, etc., so bear with me. I'm actually thinking of making the journal part of a frameset and have the navigation buttons on the left side. These buttons would exist on every page. Still coming up with ideas. Web building is a lot of fun!

 Wendy's Loses Its Father Today I found out that Dave Thomas, the founder and spokesman for Wendy's International, had passed away from liver cancer. What a great guy he was! The commercials I saw on TV weren't at all pretentious, which, from what I read, describes the man who founded the company. I can still remember the "Where's the Beef?" set of commercials in 1980. What a riot! He died extremely wealthy, according to a urlLink Forbes report . I also loved that he supported adoption so much. He will be missed in the flesh, but I believe we'll still see him, perhaps in cartoon form, like "The Colonel" from KFC.

 It's showtime, baby! Good afternoon, world! As I listened to a radio talkshow yesterday, I heard the idea of a Dick Vitale alarm clock. Can you imagine? - "Time to wake up! It's showtime, baby!" - "It's almost 8, you're gonna be late!" I've never heard Dick Vitale announce before, but hearing this was a hoot.

 OK. I know I said I was going to leave, but I still had to verify that I could publish this to our website. I'm pleased that I have been able to publish, but I'm not satisfied with how everything looks. It all looks like it was "smooshed" together, which, of course, it was. OK. I'm going to try to publish and then, I will leave. Bye!

 As you may have guessed by now, I should be going home, but I think I'm liking this stuff...

 Ideas for the Family Website I've been gathering ideas to include on our family's website. I plan to include some information about our daughter, Keisha, who is hard of hearing. This search has led me to some interesting sites, such as the following: urlLink Phonak MicroLink MLx FM System , which we recently obtained; urlLink Audiology Department, Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio , where we obtained her hearing aids and FM system; urlLink Children's Medical Center, Dayton, Ohio , where Keisha's current audiologist/speech therapist is located; urlLink Community Services for the Deaf in Dayton, Ohio urlLink OtiKids Web Site, from Oticon, who made Keisha's hearing aids OK. So that's it for now. Later. Update: Some other things to include on our family's website include family pictures "About" pages for Dan, Jennie, and Keisha family mission statement enhanced guestbook with additional fields, etc. (such as, how in the World Wide Web did you find this site?) Either I'll use this forum to desribe what is new and as a journal, or I'll use something else. Update: To help visitors know what is new to the Family home page, I've provided the means to sign up for a mailing list on the home page itself, via urlLink NotifyList.com . I plan to send this list on a monthly basis. urlLink So sign up now !

 OK. This is the first time I've done this. I thought is was a good idea, based on what I've read elsewhere. I am so new to web-building and web publishing, and I am so happy that a forum exists for me to type what's going on inside my mind. Question: Is it possible to identify how many websites are actually available on the Web?

 Whew! Spent a lot of time updating the website this afternoon.

 People Are Strange, Part 5 My neighbor works in the operations department in the central office of a large bank. Employees in the field call him when they have problems with their computers. One night he got a call from a woman in one of the branch banks who had this question: "I've got smoke coming from the back of my terminal. Do you guys have a fire downtown?"

 People Are Strange, Part 4 I was sitting in my science class, when the teacher commented that the next day would be the shortest day of the year. My lab partner became visibly excited, cheering and clapping. I explained to her that the amount of daylight changes, not the actual amount of time. Needless to say, she was very disappointed.

 People Are Strange, Part 3 Police in Radnor, Pennsylvania, interrogated a suspect by placing a metal colander on his head and connecting it with wires to a photocopy machine. The message "He's lying" was placed in the copier, and police pressed the copy button each time they thought the suspect wasn't telling the truth. Believing the "lie detector" was working, the suspect confessed.

 People Are Strange, Part 2 Recently a distraught young lady was spotted weeping beside her car. "Do you need some help?" I asked. She replied, "I knew I should have replaced the battery to this remote door unlocker. Now I can't get into my car. Do you think they (pointing to a distant convenient store) would have a battery to fit this?" "Hmmm, I dunno. Do you have an alarm too?" I asked. "No, just this remote thingy," she answered, handing it and the car keys to me. As I took the key and manually unlocked the door, I replied, "Why don't you drive over there and check about the batteries. It's a long walk."

 People Are Strange, Part 1 This next series of posts, entitled "People Are Strange", are excerpts from an email I received from my friend JI: A lady at work was seen putting a credit card into her floppy drive and pulling it out very quickly. When inquired as to what she was doing, she said she was shopping on the Internet and they kept asking for a credit card number, so she was using the ATM "thingy".

 A Run For My Life I had a very strange dream last night. Some other people (friends?) and I were being chased through a multi-story building with a parking lot by a psychopath. It also took place at a park nearby. The dream seemed like it lasted about an hour, as though it could have been an episode of a TV drama. As these things often are, unfortunately the details are now fuzzy. Below are some things that I can remember, though: - The chase mostly occurred on the elevators - We knew that a friend of ours, TM, was on his way into work. He had parked on the 9-1/2th floor. We tried for as long as possible to keep the elevator from stopping there because we knew that TM was unaware of the danger before him. - To make the elevator stop at the 9-1/2 floor, you had to press the buttons for the 9th and 10th floors and stop the elevator in between. I remember something like this being done in the movie " urlLink Being John Malchovich ". - Just as soon as we thought things were getting back to normal, this guy - the psychopath - would flip out again and resume chasing us. - Indeed we felt like we were almost always on the run for our lives. - Eventually we thought it was safe enough to get TM from the 9-1/2th floor, but as soon as we stopped there, we realized that the psycho has become aware of the existence of the 9-1/2 floor. We had somehow thought that it was a "safe haven" - until then. - Unfortunately we couldn't help our friend TM. By the time we arrived at the 9-1/2th floor, the psychopath had already got to him.

 The Hunt, Part 2 He didn't have much time. If he was going to do it, then this was the time. No turning back... The thrill of the hunt is what drove him. He'd often go without sleep when he was in pursuit. Nothing but reaching his goal would satisfy him. He'd deal with each obstacle as it came, overcoming and advancing. No weather, no circumstance, nobody was going to stop him from getting... ... that cheeseburger.

 The Hunt, Part 1 He felt the hunger pangs in his mortal coil again. This time they were stronger and didn't seem to want to subside. He knew he had to do something quickly, or he would be overcome. So he made a mad dash for the vending machine. He reached into his pocket only to discover that he had no change to obtain that which his body needed, the sustance for his soul. He looked around and saw the fire extinguisher hanging on the wall. No one else was around anyway, and he was usually the last one to leave his workplace. He further glanced around and saw that there were no cameras watching his every move. So he yanked the fire extinguisher off the wall and smashed it into the vending machine. The glass shattered and he now had access to as much candy, chips, gum, and cookies as he wanted. He gathered as much as he could in his arms and headed back to his cubicle. He sat down and began opening each item and eating it. About fifteen minutes later, he fell asleep, satisfied that his hunt had been successful.

 Continuance... He cried harder than he ever thought he could cry. His heart ached so hard. He thought he was going crazy, the whirlwind of images blowing his mind. He fell to the floor, clutching his hands in desperation, begging for relief. The pain was almost more than he could handle. He looked up and the world appeared crooked, tilted somehow. Then the door slammed open with a crash. Four men wearing white came in with a stretcher. The sound of them walking was like an Army marching to a cadence. "How could they be so cruel?" he thought, pounding his head to the floor. The men gathered our hero and carried him out of his room and placed him in the ambulance. Some time later, he woke up in the hospital ward, somehow well-rested. The sun was shining warmly on his face. Even the headache was beginning to wear off. He was relieved that the overdose of pills had finally worn off. This would be the last time.

 Different Interpretations (subtitled - Karaoke) Last Saturday, February 15, 2002, Jennie and I went to a marriage retreat sponsored by our urlLink church . The entertainment portion consisted of karaoke by those attending. The hardest part, for me at least, at one of these things, is to come up with my first song to do. I chose " urlLink Bohemian Rhapsody " by Queen, but I didn't want to do it all by myself. A song like that requires at least four people. I wound up getting five people to come up on stage with me. It was a riot! I couldn't see anyone in the audience because of the stage lights, but I didn't care. When it came to the fast instrumental section ("So you think you can stone me..."), we did the " urlLink Wayne's World " head-banging thang. Then, about six songs later, I was back onstage, doing " urlLink Mambo No. 5 ", by Lou Bega. Let's just say these were both... um... different interpretations .

 Finding The Lord:Your Monday Morning Devotional delivered right to yer e-mail box The following came from GB - what a funny guy! A drunk stumbles along a Baptismal service on a Sunday afternoon down by the river. He proceeds to stumble down into the water and stands next to the Minister. The Minister turns, notices the old drunk and says, "Mister, are you ready to find Jesus?" The drunk looks back and says, "Yes sir, I am." The Minister then dunks the fellow under the water and pulls him right back up. "Have you found Jesus?" the Minister asked. "No, I didn't!" said the drunk. The Minister then dunks him under for quite a bit longer, brings him up and says, "Now brother, have you found Jesus?" "No, I did not!" said the man again. Disgusted, the Minister holds the man under for at least 30 seconds this time, brings him up and demands, "For the grace of God, have you found Jesus yet?!!!??" The old drunk wipes his eyes and pleads, "Are you sure this is where he fell in???"

 More Small Talk @ Work Question of the Day In response to GB's earlier message, LC wrote: Wow. I feel depressed just reading that. I was planning on working outside on my car's radiator hoses, getting dirty, freezing my arms and fingers off, skinning my knuckles on the engine whenever my hands slip off the wrench or I snap the head off another bolt (I've snapped 3 bolts off already.) Then I will get changed and go to work for six hours. Then I will come home and work on two homework assignments that I have already spent four hours on that are due tomorrow and I doubt that I can complete. But after all that, such a long and difficult day, I will come home and give my girlfriend a call and talk to my sweet, because it's Valentines Day. What a special day this is for both of us. Oh, wait, I don't have a girlfriend. Before I crash for the night, I will probably eat some oatmeal and some shredded wheat straight from the box 'cause I don't have any milk, and wash it down with some water. I will be so tired that I will go to sleep without brushing my teeth. Then I will fall asleep because it's two in the morning. That is my plan for Valentines day. - LC

 A friend of mine, GB, whose tagline on his emails is "Peace, Love, & Hair Gel", sent me this message. He's a pretty wacky fellow. Small Talk @ Work Question of the Day: What Are U doing for Valentines Day?? answer: I am going to spend the evening laying in bed in the dark listening to Bette Midlers song "The Rose" play over and over again while I am surrounded by all kinds of pies, cakes, cookies and chips... eating myself into a food coma... and then not come of out the house for about 2 weeks...

 Like Peeing on the Floor This may sound like a strange title, but you'll get what I mean as you read on. We came home tonight from a meeting with MM and KM, two close friends of ours, to talk about our marriage. I thought things were going Ok, but Jennie didn't think so. So we discussed how she was feeling and why she was feeling that way. It turns out that I haven't been as considerate of her as I should be. In the Bible, Philippians 2:3-4 urlLink mentions that we should think of one another as better than ourselves. I haven't been doing that, and I've realized that I'm hurting Jennie when I'm being this way. She doesn't feel loved, for example, when I spend more time at work than need be, or more time on the computer, instead of with her. It's not that she wants to hog all my time; she just needs to feel loved. She needs me, with my full attention. We also discussed how Jennie ought to change, from my perspective. This question was very hard for me to answer at first. I started getting very emotional, to the point where I was crying. I don't know exactly where it came from - all of a sudden I was sobbing in their living room. I felt incredibly embarassed, as though I had lost control of my bladder and was peeing on their floor. I felt guilty for once again hearing how much I've hurt my wife by my actions. I really hate myself when I do that. Feeling so bad about it, I guess, led to the guilt, which led to the depressive episode, which included the crying. It was another of those times when I struggled to find good in the situation. Boy, when this depression hits, it hits hard. One thing I am definitely grateful for in our marriage is that our love is there, yet there are still times when I need to be affirmed. You know what I mean? I know women feel the same way - we need to hear that we're loved and appreciated. I guess that I haven't been feeling that from Jennie lately. And she hasn't felt loved because I've let other things occupy my time instead of her. So we both have things to work on - which is why we wake up in the morning - because God isn't finished with us yet. Oh yeah, the great thing about true friends is that they love you even when you behave like a child who's peeing on the floor. So long and good night, everyone.

 Watching Paint Dry Not everything I've done in my life compares to watching paint dry, but I participated in something today that ranks right up there with it. This morning I was part of a group that upgraded our work PCs to a customized version of Windows XP. The installation process took about an hour and a half. That the company I'm working for had set this up as an automated process probably kept it from taking longer. But backing up everything, installing other applications I work with, and bringing the backed-up data after the installation made entire process take about 4 hours. So, you wanna know how I passed the time? That's right. You've guessed. I played pinball on my laptop that I obtained from the consulting company I work for. I'm actually getting pretty good at it. My highest score so far is over 5 million points. Update: In case you haven't realized, this is sign of urlLink geekiness I know... this doesn't have much to do with the price of tea in China, but hey! - it's a lot better than watching paint dry.

 Things are going better today. I began reading a book by Thom Hartmann, called "ADD Success Stories".

 Navy Summary of Mishaps - First Edition Note: I got this from ME, who is stationed at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, in Dayton, Ohio. A. Jackie Gleason used to say that he drank because drinking took warts and moles off other peoples faces. What he failed to mention is the fact that booze, as a universal solvent, immediately liquefies all the cells and synapses in those areas of the brain having to do with judgment, coordination, and common sense; turns them to mush. Afterward, its like trying to cogitate with a cranium full of Cream of Wheat. Here are three quickies to illustrate my point: -- A n airman with a BAC (blood alcohol content) of 0.22 decided it would be the coolest thing ever if he jumped onto the back bumper of a departing Honda delete Sol to see how long he could hang on to the trunk lid as it sped away. Got to give the kid credit for tenacity. He stayed with it till 50 miles an hour, when his fingernails failed structurally, at which time, parasitic drag dumped him onto the highway. -- A pickup truckload of our Coast Guard brethren left a bar and headed down the road with four drunks in the cab and two more drunks passed out in the bed. (Yes, as it turns out, our friends in the funny hats are human, too.) After they dropped their first shipmate off at home, they regained the interstate and were headed for the second guys house at about 55 miles an hour when, like a scene from Night of the Living Dead, one of the corpses in the back stood up, wobbled slightly, stepped stiffly over the tailgate and disappeared into the glare of headlights from oncoming traffic. Suddenly everybodys sober. They screech to a halt. Doors fly open. Everyone bails out and races back along the interstate in a frantic search for their buddy. But they cant find him. Wait! There he is! Face down in the middle of the interstate backlit by the headlights of a car that has him bore-sighted! Time compression kicks in as they all wave their arms in slow motion and scream (in an extremely low register), "NOOOOOOO!" Trying, to no avail, to ward off the inevitable. Thump-Thump. And the car sped off into the night didnt even slow down. But you know what? The guy lived! I mean he was messed up big time, but he lived, which means, in the face of this new evidence, that I must retract my previous statement. Them Coasties aint human after all. -- A s soon as a drunken Marine ditched his liberty buddies and headed back to the base, he spied a restaurant and thought hes stop in for a bite to eat. The fact that the restaurant was closed didnt slow the sergeant down a whit. This Marine wanted chow and no bars, no locked doors, and no alarm systems were going to stand in his way. Perhaps it was the cold food or maybe it was the slow service, but something must have really irritated this guy because after hed been in there a while he began to tear the place up. It wasnt long before the gendarmes, summoned by burglar alarm, arrived and tried some of their high-powered psychology to coax the Marine outside. But, he (totally impervious to logic) wasnt having any of that and told the copy to take their best shot. Well, in this case, the cops best shot happened to be a ninety-pound German Shepherd, and they told the hungry Marine that if he didnt come out, they were sending Bruno in. "Bring him on!" says the Marine. And so Chief Wiggims let slip the dog of war. BA DA BING! The dog is on the Marine like white on rice and showing absolutely no respect for the sergeant. Actually, Brunos finding the sergeant to be a rather zesty morsel (kinda like a slider at Mid-rats), and the fact that the Marine decided to fight back only served to whet the dogs already prodigious appetite all the more. In the end, of course, the score was Drunken-Devil Dog - zero, Regular Dog - five. (Five being the total number of useless fingers dangling at the end of the sergeants right arm that ever since that night have refused to respond to his commands.) B . I always get burn severity messed up. Cant remember if its third degree or first degree that leaves you looking like a burger that fell off the grille and lay unnoticed on the coals for a spell. I will say this, however. I got this second degree burn stuff down pat, especially after I dumped boiling water and equally boiling coffee grounds on my hand one morning recently while trying to brew a cup of java while I was still asleep. But that was small change compared to what a drunken seaman did not long ago. It seems that six beers and a couple shots of bourbon convinced this guy he was an acrobat. After ditching his buddies at the bar, our here made it back to the pier Ok. But there, the lure of fame and the challenge of the high wire were more than he could resist. So, instead of plodding drunkenly along on something stable and flat link the concrete roadway, this would=be Flying Wallenda jumped up on the CHT piping that ran parallel with the pier and began tippy-toeing along its length toward his ship. And he was lookin gooooood, beloved. Until, that it, he encountered a knot of pumps and valves that squirts a solution of highly caustic hypochlorite into the raw sewage. There, he stumbled and fell. But, true to his calling, he wasnt going down without a fight. He frantically grabbed for a handhold anything to break his fall, and he snagged one! Unfortunately, what he snagged was one of those high pressure chemical lines which immediately popped out of its fitting and sprayed our hapless hero from head to toe with a caustic bath of searing hypo-chloride. At the hospital they catalogued his misery as: second degree chemical burns of the groin, the abdomen, left thigh, right ear, left face and left arm. And, for good measure, a third degree burn on his inner right thigh that nearly fried his oysters and will require several skin grafts. But I did get a chuckle out of the unbridled optimism of this report, which said that, after five days in the hospital and 35 days out of work, No permanent disability is anticipated." Yeah, right. I burned my hand two months ago and its still as pink as sunrise except when it turns purplish red in the shower and throbs like mad if I get it in warm water. Dont let anybody fool you; this guys going to be in pain for a long, long time. C . I read in the paper this week that Daimler-Chrysler has embarked on a program designed to provide job security for the entire traffic safety section of the naval safety center for a good many years to come. With the rollout of their new Dodge, V-10, pick-up truck, we enter a new era of potential disaster. When one considers that sailors in the past have actually managed to break telephone poles in half using just a motorcycle, the possibilities for carnage, mayhem, death and destruction posed by this new, 150-mile-an-hour, 4000 pound, unguided rocket in the hands of your average North American blue jacket are enough to boggle the mind. Heaven knows theyre doing a more than adequate job with the tools at hand today: A carload of sailors were on their way to a little weekend liberty, when the kid in the right seat spilled a drink in his lap and then turned and started ragging the driver about his erratic motoring skills. The driver barked back. So, in response, the passenger dumped what was left in his cup on the drivers leg you know, just to give him a feel for what its like to be facing a night on the town looking like youve recently lost control of your bladder. This brought a heated retort from the driver, who totally failed to see the humor. At which time the passenger doubled up his fist and smashed it into the windshield (Take that!), and the driver responded by slamming on the brakes and skidding headfirst into a mini-van in the opposing lane of traffic. A t a party Saturday night I met a woman who teaches anger management to elementary school children. I found that highly amusing until she explained to me there is real value in early training for the still undeveloped infantile mind in the techniques for handling stress and managing anger. Maybe Ill give her these guys address to see if she can hook them up with some kind of correspondence course. It couldnt hurt. --- end of post ----

 I am feeling very emotional. I just spent time praying to God about how I'm feeling. Crying, angry, bitter, frustrated. Hot tears falling from my eyes. Hurting from within my heart, wanting it all to go away. Even more troublesome was that I was doing this in front of my little girl. She had been "scared", and both Jennie and I were tired, wanting to go to bed. She kept crying out for one of us. When she cried out to me, I was so upset. I went in with my voice raised telling her she needed to go to sleep. I asked if she wanted to pray, and she said yes. Well, I started praying for her, and then I started crying out my frustration with how I've been feeling. I often have a hard time with this depression and ADHD stuff I'm dealing with. I have trouble seeing what I can control and what I cannot. I'm upset that I'm hurting those whom I love the most - Jennie and Keisha. I've not been responsible. I feel like I've let so many people down, especially Jennie. Because of this I feel so guilty. Why do I keep putting her and Keisha through these times? This is not who I was when we got married. Our relationship was so much different then than it is now. It seems so much harder now. The feelings aren't always there, but my commitment is. I don't understand why I'm feeling this way. I wish I could be happy and not mess up the world around me. I want this all to go away.

 Changes I've spent the last couple of hours modifying the layout of this journal. It was a bit frustrating since I couldn't get it to look exactly as I want it. But I'm satisfied with where it is now. I've really gotta get home. Jennie and Keisha are waiting...

 No Man is an Island urlLink Hebrews 10:24 :: NIV I've been seeing a lot of selfishness in my own life and in others' lives. Even now, I don't feel like giving my heart to others because I'm not feeling 100% healthy. We can be so easily distracted by the worries of life, etc. We all need to do our part in taking care of ourselves and each other. In addition, we need to keep praying to God. Write letters in a journal (this online weblog is a great venue). Write poems, love letters to Jesus. We all need to grow deeper in our love for him. For help, I often go back to the urlLink Psalms , for example. In addition, the Bible states in Hebrews 10:25-27 that we need to consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds. I believe this is possible. I also believe that God has given all of us gifts to be used to serve him. I am trying to think of my mental illness as a gift from God. I'm not always good at doing that, but I'm trying. The apostle Paul wrote that urlLink God uses our weaknesses to demonstrate his power , so, Amen, then, show your power, O Lord! I look forward to the urlLink plans that God has for all of us . Let me encourage you to read urlLink Ephesians 1 . I read that a lot this weekend, and it encouraged me so much! It was like I was reading all of this for the first time.

 Monday morning, back at work. Still tired from lack of sleep this weekend. 16 oz. coffee hasn't quite kicked in yet. Need something for the pain around my eyes. Ibuprofen, take me away!

 OK, But Not That Much! In my previous urlLink post , I mentioned that I like pizza - that it is my favorite food. Well, I don't like it quite as much as this woman apparently did: Kimberly Herricks, 36, a manager for Donato's Pizza, Lakewood, Ohio, was indicted in December for stealing $38,000 from the company, an amount that included the value of 400 decaying pizzas found in her garage. According to police, she had invented big call-in orders at her store for schools, hospitals, etc., just to get her store's sales figures up and her name in the company newsletter. She would then adjust the books to cover the costs and deliver the pizzas, herself, to her own garage. She was busted when she asked her boss (the owner) to help her move to a new house, and he discovered the rotting pizzas. [Plain Dealer, 12-4-01] 6/8/2003 Update: I updated the link to the post.

 Favorite Foods Keisha and I are talking about what her favorite food of all time is, as we're getting ready to have breakfast of cereal, milk, and orange juice. By the way, Keisha would like to say something: ggghhhhyuuuummmmdmmjjjiiiiuulppoo9yu y 77h , which she says means "go" . Hmm... Anyhow, my favorite food is pizza; hers is cheeseburgers.

 A Recap During a Nightcap Greetings, crimestoppers! Time for a brief recap of my day (Saturday). Started off by going to bed at 4:10 AM after watching the movies " urlLink Bounce " and " urlLink Hannibal " (quite a combination, huh?). Naturally, it took a little while to fall asleep, having the ending of "Hannibal" still in my mind (pun not intended). Keisha came in at about 8:30 AM as Jennie was heading to the library to return some videos ('Yes, get that 'Hannibal' film out of here!!!!"). At about 10:39 Keisha convinced me to get out of bed. So I got up for a few seconds and then lay back down. Finally, around 10:45 I get up for good. Since it was late morning, we wondered if we still could have breakfast. Keisha and I thought about that for a little bit, and then we were distracted by the nice weather outside. Jennie came home shortly after noon, so we decided to get out of the house and get something to eat. But we wanted some time to read our Bibles without Keisha distracting us, so we decided to go to a place that has a play area for kids - the urlLink Burger King in urlLink Beavercreek, Ohio , near the urlLink Mall at Fairfield Commons . Silly us. We chose the busiest place in the area. Fortunately for me, I had some headphones as I typed into my laptop, but Jennie, I could tell, was very distracted.. About 2 PM we left an went to the urlLink Deaf Association of Dayton on Valley Street to hang out there for a few hours. There we met Tom and Elizabeth from urlLink Kettering . Tom was born deaf, and his wife Elizabeth is a substitute teacher at urlLink St. Rita's School for the Deaf in Woodlawn, Ohio. It was great learning new signs, etc. I could tell Jennie and Keisha had fun, too. Then we came home. I was eager for a nap by now, but Jennie encouraged me that we should go through our mail. We hadn't gone through it together in awhile. Perhaps more on that another time. Needless to say, I did the right thing and did not take a nap. After working through the mail for awhile, we decided we needed a break. So we went to urlLink Meijer in Englewood . We really only needed a few items, but somehow we spent a lot of time there. It may have had something to do with Keisha and I getting split up from Jennie and those three laps around the grocery section we took looking for her. It may have also been due to our browsing videos, pets, toys, and more. Nevertheless, by about 9 PM, we all were pretty bushed. So we came home put Keisha to bed after feeding her some leftover urlLink Pizza Hut stuffed crust pizza . Then Jennie cooked a frozen pizza we bought, and we ate it while watching the movie " urlLink Rattle and Hum " by urlLink U2 . Funny. It's almost 1 AM on Sunday morning and I'm still going. Well, not exactly. My eyes are barely open. Even funnier are all the references to places in this entry for which I could create hyperlinks. Perhaps later. I'm heading for the sack. Night everyone. God bless.

 US Rep. Tony Hall May Have a Job Offer According to a urlLink local news report , Dayton Congressman Tony Hall may be asked to join President Bush's administration. If/when he does, a special election will be held to fill the vacancy. Dayton Republicans are endorsing former Dayton mayor Mike Turner, while Democrats have said that they would be in a bind.

 Bond, James Bond will make an 'Alias' appearance If any of you have never seen this show, urlLink here's a good reason to do it. Jennie and I make it part of our Sunday evening ritual. We make sure Keisha is in bed between 8-9 PM so that when the show starts at 9, we are there.

 Back at work. Getting ready to focus on the task at hand. I am going to work on being focused and try to reduce the distractions around me. Much thanks to my friend and brother GP for his encouragement. He sent me an email after he heard I have ADHD. God has definitely been working miracles in his life recently. He's undergone much treatment for cancer, and it looks like it's helped out a lot. I'm also encouraged about Rush Limbaugh's story regarding his hearing loss. He recently began using cochlear implants and has regained most of his hearing loss. Cheers to an awesome day! 8-D 6/8/2003 Update: Removed the reference to an obsolete link.

 Dream Below is an excerpt from an email I received today from my friend Jeff: that's weird that you email. i actually had a dream about you and Keisha last night. you emailed me something like this and were telling me how well keisha's piano lessons were going. You said she only had two lessons left. On your website you had a link to audio where she was playing beethoven quality music! i'm going to freak out if i check out your website and there is anything remotely close to that!!!!! Since he was wondering if there would be "anything remotely close to that", I thought I'd include the whole thing! 8-D

 Train a Child urlLink Bible Gateway Proverbs 22:6 :: NIV Last night, as I tucked my daughter Keisha into bed, something happened that blew me away. She said, "Daddy, I want to pray to God." Since my wife Jennie or I usually initiate praying with her before she falls asleep, I was naturally surprised and very encouraged by her comment. So we prayed together.

 Eating an Elephant Last night I met with my psychologist. It is quite apparent that I have some type of ADHD. I can see problems from a global scale and get completely overwhelmed and avoid them. At other times I get bogged down unnecessarily on details. We discussed breaking tasks down into small, manageable pieces - pieces that I can handle and commit to doing for a short period of time. Kinda like eating an elephant. Eating the whole elephant is an overwhelming task when considered from a global perspective. But, when the task is broken down into subtasks, the task is not as overwhelming. I know this, but I haven't applied this to my life that well. So now I start.

 Tooth Extraction I was talking with a coworker this morning who is considering having his wisdom teeth taken out. We've told him about our experiences, and he's a little apprehensive, not wanting it to be a horror story himself. I got all four of my wisdom teeth taken out at once. Before going to the oral surgeon's office, I ate some hot and spicy buffalo wings, since I knew that I wouldn't be able to eat them for awhile. I didn't have insurance coverage (college boy supporting self fortunately had $ from co-op job and student loans), so I had to pay out of pocket. Fortunately, I had waited until all four of them had erupted. All the surgeon had to do was extract them; no cutting necessary. Only local anesthesia (novocaine?) on the jaw. So there I was. Wide awake, yet feeling no pain... for now. The surgeon pulled three of them out. The last one was harder. I remember him yanking my jaw back and forth ("Gee, you're really making me work for this one!" said the man getting paid over $100 per tooth.). That hurt a little. After it was all finished, I contacted my roommates, who picked me up. Eager to get home, I climbed in the back seat. Jorge, one of my roommates, wanted to check on his job application at University Hospital, so we stopped there. What was meant to be a very quick wait wound up lasting over a half hour. By this time I was hurting big time, and very eager to get home and rest. So when that time finally arrived, I went upstairs and lay down in bed. Some time later the phone rang. It was Lindsey Nelson, a friend from church who was in Medical School at UC (i.e., University of Cincinnati). "What's up?" he asked. "I'm in pain. I just had my wisdom teeth taken out." I muffled with my mouth full of cotton. "Would you like a shake?" he asked. "Sure." I replied. I hung up and went back to sleep. Sometime later Lindsey shows up with a 32-oz homemade chocolate shake.

 What's Going On I have an appointment with my psychologist tonight at 6 PM. Please pray that I can be open and that God can use this guy to really help me. Ok. So that's about it for me. Wait.

 Journey Into Geekdom, Part 6 Yes, ladies and gentlemen. It's the moment you've been waiting for... the Pinball update. Today at lunch (lunch seems to be a great time to do this), I achieved a new all-time high score... 11,759,750

 Truck Accident Two trucks loaded with a thousand copies of Roget's Thesaurus collided as they left a New York publishing house last Thursday, according to the Associated Press.

 One More Angel In Heaven "Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints. " - urlLink Psalm 116:15 (NIV) I know I'm supposed to be happy when a faithful disciple of Jesus dies because that person is going to heaven, but urlLink this article saddens me especially because this woman belonged to our church, and her husband used to as well. Now because of these circumstances, their three children are thrust into the world without there mommy or daddy around. I often struggle with thoughts of what her last moments must have been like. It causes chills to run up and down my spine. I am grateful for my marriage to Jennie and for having other people involved in our lives to help us. I believe that God is in control and will work this situation out for his glory. Nevertheless, I cannot hide how I feel about the circumstances surrounding my sister-in-Christ's death.

 Journey Into Geekdom, Part 5 History is continuing to be made, folks. I know that you wait with baited breath to find out how my Pinball game is going. Without further ado, today at lunch I increased my high score to... 9,103,500 !!!!! (I knew you'd be excited)

 Keeping Yourself Busy In Prison Three convicts were on the way to prison. They were each allowed to take one item with them to help them occupy their time while incarcerated. On the bus, one turned to another and said, "So, what did you bring?" The second convict pulled out a box of paints and stated that he intended to paint anything he could. He wanted to become the "Grandma Moses of Jail". Then he asked the first, "What did you bring?" The first convict pulled out a deck of cards and grinned and said, "I brought cards. I can play poker, solitaire, gin, and any number of games." The third convict was sitting quietly aside, grinning to himself. The other two took notice and asked, "Why are you so smug? What did you bring?" The guy pulled out a box of tampons and smiled. He said, "I brought these." The other two were puzzled and asked, "What can you do with those?" He grinned and pointed to the box and said, "Well according to the box, I can go horseback riding, swimming, roller-skating...."

 Emergency Room Yesterday our family made a trip to the emergency room. It turned out to be a long wait for inconclusive results. Sunday night Jennie was having abdominal and back pain, which kept her from going to sleep. At about 1:30 AM we drove to the hospital. Jennie was admitted at 1:40 AM. About an hour and a half later Keisha and I were asked to go to her room. We waited. And tried to keep Keisha from getting into everything. Keisha had a rough time waking up, but after about an hour, she was wide awake, as though it was daytime. So there Jennie and I were, extremely tired, trying to keep Keisha from getting into everything in the examining room. With the pillow Keisha brought I lay down on the floor and tried to doze off. How crazy. No chance of getting to sleep there. Why the long wait, we wondered. I went to the nurses' station and asked what was taking so long. I found out that they needed to do some tests on Jennie to try to uncover what was wrong. I asked Jennie if she would mind if Keisha and I went out to get a bite to eat. She said she didn't mind. So Keisha and I got into the car, trying to dodge the freezing rain, and we drove to the ATM and then to White Castle, the closest 24-hour restaurant. Of course they didn't have the Cinnamon rolls we wanted, so we opted for the Cheese danish and Apple danish. We drove back to the hospital parking lot and ate our food, and then we went back inside the ER. Nothing had changed; Jennie was still waiting, but fortunately, she had gotten a little bit of sleep. I asked Jennie if she would mind if Keisha and I went back to the car and napped. She said she didn't. I told her that the hospital folks could call us on the cell phone if they needed. So Keisha and I went back to the car and fell asleep. At about 5:30 AM Jennie came out, having been discharged and with a prescription in hand. It all seemed like a waste of time, to have waited so long for something that might as well been taken care of at the doctor's office. But, I guess it's better to be safe. Jennie and I were suprised that Keisha still wanted to go to school, having had intermittent sleep during the night. But she insisted. I, on the other hand, chose to stay home and take care of Jennie. This came in handy when I go a phone call to go pick up a friend who had just had outpatient surgery. I was able to let Jennie sleep while I picked our friend up. I also was able to see Keisha off the school bus when it was time for her to come home. In between these times, I got some more sleep. In fact, at about 2:30 PM, I told Jennie I was going to take a nap. I woke up at 8 PM. It was indeed a crazy day.

 Groundhog Day This movie is one of my all-time favorites. We're watching it right now, at Keisha's request. Instead of the Academy Awards. At least until Keisha goes to bed. What if you were given one day that you would live over and over?

 Hmmm... The updates to my Blogger template don't seem to be going through. FYI, whenever I post something with a headline, I update my Blogger template and republish all the archive pages. For the past few days, the template updates don't appear to be working. Perhaps this is an early reminder that Geocities is going to halt the practice of allowing free remote FTP's to websites under their domain. Bummer!

 Ronald McDonald Comes to Our House, Part 1 Tonight we went through the drive thru at McDonald's, and Keisha saw a picture of Ronald McDonald. This prompted her to say that she wants him to "come to my house." This is what she typically says when she sees someone that she likes. Below is an excerpt of the conversation that followed. By the way, she's four years old. Daddy: Where would he stay? Keisha: In my room. Daddy: Where would he sleep? Keisha: On my bed. I'd sleep on the floor. Daddy: Oh. Who's toothbrush would he use? Keisha: My pink one that I don't use anymore. Daddy: What food does he like to eat? Keisha: He like hamburgers. Daddy: Really? Does he like broccoli? Keisha: Yeah. Daddy: Cauliflower? Keisha: No. He likes broccoli. Daddy: Peas? Carrots? Keisha: No. He likes broccoli! Daddy: What kind of music does he like to listen to? Keisha: "Jingle Bells" Daddy: Really? What kind of movies does he like to watch? Keisha: He'll watch Barney with me. And he can play on the 'puter (computer) with me. Daddy: Oh. I see. --- to be continued ---

 Journey Into Geekdom, Part 4 Today my new high score in Pinball is 9,002,750!!!

 Singing Dreams, Vol. 1 I had a dream last night that I was singing for a group of people at church at a function outside, in a pavillion. While I was singing a certain song, my microphone started to fade out. I asked the sound guys to turn up the volume of my mike, but there was nothing they could do. Something was wrong with the sound system, and they were unable to fix it until the show was over. So I had to lip-sync the next song, "Shine", by the Newsboys.

 Attack of the Clones Going Digital I don't know whether to be happy about this yet or not. I just read in this urlLink Forbes article that George Lucas is going to release Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones only in digital format. According to this article there aren't many theatres with the capability to show them yet. I don't know if there are any in the Dayton area or not.

 Having a Birthday (or Godly Sorrow vs. Worldly Sorrow) Today I had a birthday. No, not the annual kind to celebrate when I've added another year to my life. More like a rebirth of sorts. It was forced on me somewhat. I had not been spending my time wisely while at work, and it was showing. I would make excuses for why progress wasn't where it should be, but really I was just horsing around, not getting the work done. I've had an improper work ethic. Today it came to a head when I was given a sharp rebuke from two of my team members. The other one was out today, but he probably could have chimed in just as much. I was presented with an ultimatum, so to speak. Needless to say, that got my attention. So, I begin anew, with an improved work ethic. I am also needing to be aware of what's going on around me. Even if others aren't seeing what I'm doing, I know that God sees, and his opinion is what ultimately matters. The true sign of a person's integrity is who they are when no one else is around. I haven't been a man of integrity, that's for sure. But I can and will keep changing. I really want to do it for God, but I know I'll be tempted to do it to please men. I have been reminded of this passage about godly sorrow vs. worldly sorrow: urlLink 2 Cor. 7:10-11

 Journey into Geekdom, Part 3 Update: This morning I surpassed my existing urlLink High Score in Pinball . It is now over 8,000,000!!!! Of course, this took many tries. I was able to accomplish this by playing 4-player games, in which I was all four players. Aren't you so excited ?

 Drink Water (or Eight Things to Do with Coca Cola) This item was sent to me by MJ over a year ago. I cannot verify whether the information here is valid or not. Interesting facts: Water vs. Coca Cola * 75% of Americans are chronically dehydrated. (Likely applies to half world pop.) In 37% of Americans, the thirst mechanism is so weak that it is often mistaken for hunger. * Even MILD dehydration will slow down one's metabolism as much as 3%. * One glass of water shuts down midnight hunger pangs for almost 100% of the dieters studied in a U-Washington study. * Lack of water: the #1 trigger of daytime fatigue. * Preliminary research indicates that 8-10 glasses of water a day could significantly ease back and joint pain for up to 80% of sufferers. * A mere 2% drop in body water can trigger fuzzy short-term memory, trouble with basic math, and difficulty focusing on the computer screen or on a printed page. * Drinking 5 glasses of water daily decreases the risk of colon cancer by 45%, plus it can slash the risk of breast cancer by 79%, and one is 50% less likely to develop ladder cancer. Are you drinking the amount of water you should every day? COKE: No wonder it tastes soooo good: 1. In many states (in the USA) the highway patrol carries two gallons of Coke in the trunk to remove blood from the highway after a car accident. 2. You can put a T-bone steak in a bowl of coke and it will be gone in two days. 3. To clean a toilet: Pour a can of Coca-Cola into the toilet bowl and ... Let the "real thing" sit for one hour, then flush clean. The citric acid in Coke removes stains from vitreous china. 4. To remove rust spots from chrome car bumpers: Rub the bumper with a crumpled-up piece of Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil dipped in Coca-Cola. 5. To clean corrosion from car battery terminals. Pour a can of Coca-Cola over the terminals to bubble away the corrosion. 6. To loosen a rusted bolt: Applying a cloth soaked in Coca-Cola to the rusted bolt for several minutes. 7. To bake a moist ham: Empty a can of Coca-Cola into the baking pan, wrap the ham in aluminum foil, and bake. Thirty minutes before the ham is finished, remove the foil, allowing the drippings to mix with the Coke for a sumptuous brown gravy. 8. To remove grease from clothes: Empty a can of coke into a load of greasy clothes, add detergent, and run through a regular cycle. The Coca-Cola will help loosen grease stains. It will also clean road haze from your windshield. FYI: - 1. The active ingredient in Coke is phosphoric acid. Its pH is 2.8. It will dissolve a nail in about 4 days. 2. To carry Coca-Cola syrup (the concentrate) the commercial truck must use the Hazardous material place cards reserved for Highly corrosive materials. 3. The distributors of Coke have been using it to clean the engines of their trucks for about 20 years. Still Want To Drink Up? Update, 27 March 2003: I've been doing some research on urlLink Snopes.com , and I found this out -- The claim that the acids in Coca-Cola not only make it a handy household cleaning product, but harmful to drink as well are false . Check out the urlLink Acid Slip page over at Snopes.com. You'll probably want to add urlLink Snopes.com to your favorites list, too. Please accept my apology for spreading false information.

 Journey Into Geekdom, Part 2 Update: I just checked my high score on the Pinball game. It's 5,705,250. I've only been able to get this high by being promoted to Ensign and completing some missions. I just now was able to get up over 4,000,000 for the first time in a WEEK! Aren't you glad you found out? (heh heh)

 The Test Thanks to my friend JI who emailed this to me: The CIA had an opening for an assassin. After all of the background checks, interviews, and testing were done there were three finalists:two men and a woman. For the final test, the CIA agents took one of the men to a large metal door and handed him a gun. "We must know that you will follow your instructions, no matter what the circumstances. Inside of this room, you will find your wife sitting in a chair. Kill Her!!!" The man said, "You can't be serious. I could never shoot my wife." The agent said, "Then you're not the right man for this job." The second man was given the same instructions. He took the gun and went into the room. All was quiet for about five minutes. Then the man came out with tears in his eyes. "I tried, but I can't kill my wife." The agent said, "You don't have what it takes. Take your wife and go home." Finally, it was the woman's turn. She was given the same instructions to kill her husband. She took the gun and went into the room. Shots were heard, one shot after another. They heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls. After a few minutes, all was quiet. The door opened slowly and there stood the woman. She wiped the sweat from her brow, and said, "This gun is loaded with blanks. I had to beat him to death with the chair."

 Journey Into Geekdom, Part 1 Among many signs that I am venturing further into "geekdom": I've stayed up until past midnight the last two days wrestling with the Pinball game on the laptop computer.

 Meeting the President Last night I had an interesting dream. It all started when I was on my way to school, and I didn't have a shirt to wear. I was bare-chested. I felt self-conscious, but since I was running a little late, I couldn't go back home to get a shirt. I saw some guys playing basketball and went over to one of them. He suggested I ask one of the guys who was playing if he had an extra shirt. I did. Then... almost immediately... the scene changed (and so does the tense). I'm in this meeting facility and have just heard that the President of the United States is on his way to give a speech at this particular facility. I am excited. After some time, I hear a helicopter. I run to the front window and notice some Secret Service men walking toward the building. I also see some important dignitaries getting off the helicopter. A receiving line begins to form outside in front of the entrance, and I join it. After a little while, the President steps out of the helicopter. But wait a minute! No, it's not George W. Bush, the current US President. It's Ronald Reagan, looking in great health, too! He proceeds toward the receiving line and greets everyone. He even shakes my hand! I am so blown away to have shaken the hand of the President of the United States. And then... the dream ends.

 The Itch He sat there on his couch staring off into space. Feeling numb from the congestion in his head, he sat motionless. Then, all of a sudden, he snapped. His face started to itch all over. He began scratching his face. Repeatedly. It started to sting, and he began to notice blood on his fingernails. His face was in pain, yet still itching badly. So he kept scratching. Eventually he passed out. Some hours later he awoke. His face felt sore, but it was no longer itching. He examined his hands; they were bloody. He stood up and went to the mirror. His face looked terrible. There were multiple gashes on his face. He went to the bathroom and washed his hands and face. It looked as though he had lost a fight with a cat. How was he going to explain this to everyone? Would they consider him weird? Unfortunately this was something he could not hide. Even if he covered them with band aids, he would still look strange. And what of his parents? He wouldn't know what to say. He felt very embarrassed, yet relieved the itch was gone.

 That Awful Feeling in My Throat Stayed home from work today. Jennie, Keisha, and I have been sick. We spent most of the day driving around going to and from doctor's appointments. So not much rest for me today. I might not go into work tomorrow. Depends. Gotta get some rest. Actually, it's been a little hard to get rest. I feel as though every other second, I have to swallow. "Secretions", if you know what I mean. Doctor said it's a sinus infection for Jennie and me. Began taking antibiotic and some cough medicine. Take plenty of fluids, I've been advised. Ok, then. Until next time, Danimal over and out

 Paranoia Sometimes at night, when I get into my car and I'm alone, I feel a little paranoid. Especially if I'm in a dark area. A couple of things go through my mind: - Hurry up, get inside the car, and lock the doors so no one else can get in - What will happen when I start the car? Will the car explode because there's a bomb?

 Miracle of Birth I just received pictures of my best friend's new baby girl. BI and his wife JI, along with their daughter LI, were in the pictures with the new baby. It's so cool to see a new person being born into the world. God is definitely awesome.

 Procrastination I was thinking earlier that of all the weaknesses in my character, if I could change my procrastination, I'd be a lot better off. I've learned recently that one of the characteristics of someone with ADHD is procrastination. As an ADHD adult, I see this a lot in my character. I tend to forego doing the things that are not as interesting to me or don't tend to hold my attention, for those activities that are more interesting and do tend to hold my attention. For instance, I thought about writing this post yesterday evening, but I've waited until right now (2:11 AM EST Thursday, March 7, 2002) to actually post. I know that I need to work on changing the procrastination in my character. That's the easy part. Actually making the changes is more difficult. I think I'll work on it later.

 Rolling for Groceries This past Sunday afternoon, I did something I never have done before. I went to Kroger to get some stuff for lunch, and as I walked in the store, I saw a wheelchair next to all the carts. My feet were a bit sore, so I thought, why not? I climbed into the wheelchair and put the basket to hold my groceries down and started off. Honestly, it felt a little weird. It was so different, going around the store in the wheelchair. For one thing, I had to use my arms to move the wheels. It was also a bit strange as I interacted with other people, especially when they or I had to move out of the way to get where we were going. I was very tempted to ask for sympathy, but I didn't, thankfully. When I finally paid for my groceries, I wheeled myself out of the store, into the parking lot, and up to my car. Then I got out of the wheelchair and walked it to where the other shopping carts were. I was glad for the experience because I can better empathize with others who use wheelchairs.

 A Good Deed He fell into a daydream. The long line of cars on the highway looked like spaghetti noodles. One lonely cloud rested in the sky, on this mid-summer night. He drove along with the top down, and the summer breeze blowing his shoulder-length hair back. He turned on the radio and heard "...a love that drips/ like honey/ sticky sweet...". And just then he spotted a disabled vehicle on the side of the highway. A woman was standing beside it waving a white handkerchief. He immediately pulled over and asked what he could do to help. Several minutes later, he lowered the hood of her car, opened the door for her to climb back in, and asked her for her phone number. Delighted that she was no longer held captive, she said "I'll tell you what, handsome follow me to the truck stop at the next exit. We can have lunch together." He agreed and hopped back into his convertible. He turned his radio on and heard U2 singing "...that was the day before love came to town..." He sped off toward the next exit.

 Icy Wind Last night he drove down Main Street several miles. He made a brief stop at the pony keg for a 12-pack of beer. The winter air was so cold that as he breathed, he could feel the chill in his chest. It felt like the same chill he usually gets from eating ice cream too fast. Back in the car, he drove several more miles, barely able to see anything. Snow fell horizontally, carried along by the heavy, icy wind. Other than the white flakes pelting his car, he could only see the flashing tailights of the cars ahead of him. Traffic was at a slow crawl, since most were not used to driving in this weather. After all, this was only the third time this winter that a snow storm like this came there way. He could not help thinking about his vacation last summer, when he fell in love once more...

 Understanding Written Communication I was inspired to write this as a result of a conversation Jennie and I had with our friend DB. She received something in an email from another friend of ours, and what it contained seemed to disturb her. Written communication can be difficult to understand. Since I read words that have already been spoken, I only have that evidence to go on in order to understand the writer's message. More exists than simply the written text. As a reader, I must consider the following: What is the main theme? What are the main points? What is the writer's tone? What can I get from the author's choice of words? What about the writer's style? What bias do I bring as I read? What is the mood of the piece? What mood do I bring as I read? If I know the writer, how is my relationship with him/her? I propose that with what an author writes, he or she has put forth a challenge to potential readers: Understand what I'm writing. While some may consider that idea obvious, I believe it is important to examine more than simply the text an author has given us. To truly understand an author's message, therefore, we must take an active role as we read.

 How are We [ADDers] Different? courtesy of Bob Seay "ADDers are no easier to stereotype than any other group of 10 to 20 million people. Within the broad umbrella of behaviors and symptoms are varied degrees of severity, ranging from mild to chronic. We know that while all hyperactive people have ADD, not all ADDers are hyperactive, or at least not physically hyperactive (mental hyperactivity is certainly a possibility). Many times, there are other factors, such as obssesive-compulsive disorder or, more commonly, depression, which co-exist with the ADD." (from the Introduction) urlLink more>>

 Living with Attention Deficit Disorder "I really wish they wouldn't call it that -- Attention Deficit Disorder. People tthink that those of us with ADD can't focus on anything. Actually, it couldn't be farther from the truth! We can focus. The problem is, we focus on everything! And because of that we have so much vying for our attention (that others usually can just tune out) we aren't able to focus on the one thing at hand." urlLink more >>

 How I'm Doing Today I haven't felt that well emotionally. I really can't put my finger on what is wrong; I just don't feel very happy right now. I'm probably in an ADHD funk. I had one last night before I went to bed. I feel a bit cynical about things going on at work - maybe that's it. I have been a bit more focused today, but I still have trouble quieting my mind down. One thing I've noticed lately is the songs going through my head. Songs I've listened to years ago, out of nowhere suddenly appear in my head. This week I've had Cheap Trick, The Police, some big band jazz, New Order, U2, and others. Maybe that comes from listening to a lot of music often. Oh well. Time to call it a day here at work.

 GPS (Gullible Person Seeker) This past weekend two other couples, along with me and my wife, did a road trip to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from Cincinnati, Ohio. More on the purpose of the trip later. The three of us guys do some type of computer programming for a living, and we brought our laptops with us - just in case (No, we left our pocket protectors at home.). Well, there was more to it than that. Mike had brought his GPS so that we wouldn't have to stop and ask for directions (Ladies, you know how hard that is for us men.). Seriously. He had this map software that worked with the GPS (most commonly known as "Global Positioning System"). The availability of this device most certainly prevented us from getting lost.

 Cellphones from Hell OK, maybe that is an exaggeration. That's just how I felt for a little while on the way home from work. To save money, we recently switched cell phone providers. We've had the new service for about a month so far, and I still haven't figured out what's going on with the phone. It's rather weird in that the calls keep going to voicemail, which I have no idea how to access. While using the hands-free unit, I got a phone call from home, and I couldn't hear my wife's voice. She heard me, though. Frustrated. About ready to throw the phone against the windshield (I was driving). I'm glad I didn't.

 You Say It's Your Birthday? Well, yesterday I turned 32. Yep, I added yet another ring to my tree trunk. I don't notice the progression as the years go by. I mean, it's not like something happens, and "Boom!" I'm another year older. The experience was great. On Sunday, my wife threw a party for me and a woman whose birthday happens to be today, the 17th. We've never had so many people there at our place. It was awesome. Many of our friends shared encouraging things about us. I have some truly remarkable friends indeed. Tonight we're going out to dinner to a place where the servers will come and sing "Happy Birthday" to us. I know it sounds cheesy, but I rather like this time.

 Knowing God's Word "The devil led him to Jerusalem and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. 'If you are the Son of God,' he said, 'throw yourself down from here. For it is written: He will command his angels concerning you to guard you carefully; they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.' Jesus answered, It says: "Do not put the Lord your God to the test.' -- urlLink Luke 4:9-12 (NIV) It is vital, if we are going to resist the temptation of the Satan, that we know God's word, found in the Bible. This passage is one of many that shows us why. Satan tempted Jesus, using Scripture! Jesus put the verse Satan quoted in context, replying with more Scripture. So, we must be careful to know God's word in its full context and should not think that this will come by a casual, once-in-a-while, perusing of the Bible. NO! We must diligently study the Word ( urlLink 1 Tim. 4:16 , urlLink Acts 17:10-11 ). Thank you.

 Words Women Use I appreciate this much needed advice from a woman for men on how to communicate with women. I've heard it said that communication across both hemispheres for a woman is like a superhighway, whereas for us men it's more like a dirt path. As a result, we need all the help we can get! FINE: This is the word we use at the end of any argument that we feel we are right about but need to shut you up. NEVER use "Fine" to describe how a woman looks. This will cause you to have one of those arguments. FIVE MINUTES: This is half an hour. It is equivalent to the five minutes that your football game is going to last before you take out the trash, so it's an even trade. NOTHING: This means something and you should be on your toes. "Nothing" is usually used to describe the feeling a woman has of wanting to turn you inside out, upside down, and backwards. "Nothing" usually signifies an argument that will last "Five Minutes" and end with the word "Fine". GO AHEAD (with raised eyebrows): This is a dare. One that will result in a woman getting upset over "Nothing" and will end with the word "Fine". GO AHEAD (normal eyebrows): This means "I give up" or "do what you want because I don't care". You will get a raised eyebrow "Go Ahead" in just a few minutes, followed by "Nothing" and "Fine" and she will talk to you in about "Five Minutes" when she cools off. LOUD SIGH: This is not actually a word, but is still often a verbal statement very misunderstood by men. A "Loud Sigh" means she thinks you are an idiot at that moment and wonders why she is wasting her time standing here and arguing with you over "Nothing". SOFT SIGH: Again, not a word, but a verbal statement. "Soft Sighs" are one of the few things that some men actually understand. She is content. Your best bet is to not move or breathe and she will stay content. THAT'S OKAY: This is one of the most dangerous statements that a woman can say to a man. "That's Okay" means that she wants to think long and hard before paying you retributions for whatever it is that you have done. "That's Okay" is often used with the word "Fine" and used in conjunction with a raised eyebrow "Go Ahead". At some point in the near future when she has plotted and planned, you are going to be in some mighty big trouble. PLEASE DO: This is not a statement, it is an offer. A woman is giving you the chance to come up with whatever excuse or reason you have for doing whatever it is that you have done. You have a fair chance to tell the truth, so be careful and you shouldn't get a "That's Okay". THANKS: A woman is thanking you. Do not faint, just say "You're Welcome." THANKS A LOT: This is much different from "Thanks". A woman will say, "Thanks A Lot" when she is really ticked off at you. It signifies that you have hurt her in some callous way, and will be followed by the "Loud Sigh". Be careful not to ask what is wrong after the "Loud Sigh", as she will only tell you "Nothing".

 We Are The World, Part 2 My other friend GB replied to the first message: What would have been worse is if he did not know how to write or read and he asked someone to write the lyrics for him and instead they wrote the lyrics to another 80's song. "Too Shy Shy" by Kajagoogoo (1983) now that would been embrassing! Was some solider or war vet down on the other side of the street holding a sign with the words to "Voices That Care" that We are The World type of song that came out during the gulf war (1991).

 We Are The World, Part 1 What weird acquaintences I have! I got this email from KM: I was on my way into work this morning and saw a man on the street who looked to be homeless with a sign with the lyrics to "We Are The World!" I tried my best the rest of the way here not to laugh especially when people looked at me like I was a nut. I just thought it was so cheesy. Then I wondered if I was in Britain would I see a man with a sign with the lyrics to "Feed The World."

 Stargazer Blue - Review urlLink I recently participated in the Peer-to-Peer Review Project, in which webloggers get to review one anothers weblog. Who knows? Perhaps someone will review this one I enjoyed my recent visit to urlLink Stargazer Blue , the weblog by Maggie (her randomly-generated name). I am unsure when the weblog was begun, since I cannot yet access the archives. I would venture to say that this blog was created recently. On this very personal site we learn a lot about her, since she has revealed a lot of detail about herself. For example, we get to read things happening in her life when she was 3-1/2, 10, and 16. From this information and other posts, we learn that Maggie is 18-19 years old and attending college somewhere in Virginia. And then, theres her favorites lists, where she lists items she has brand loyalty, people who are on her bad side (only three), TV shows, music, and so on. She is not afraid to share how shes really feeling, whether its about her roommate or spring break or her family. Maggie appears to enjoy her online presence very much, as evidenced by the link to her Harry Potter fanfic and her passion for listening to remixes of video game music. I have oftern wondered myself what the dance mix of the theme to "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?" would sound like. This blog would be somewhere I would like to return to in awhile, once the layout and navigation is completed. It appears that she plans to add more links and a webcam sometime in the future. I did follow some of the links that were included, however. I especially like the link to the "What Muppet Am I?" quiz (I'm Fozzie, by the way.). Stargazer Blue provides the subjective, personal touch and refreshing perspective that we enjoy about weblogs. I definitely look forward to coming back.

 Personal Air Conditioning The air was hot and humid around him. Everyone else was sweating, but he wasn't. He was born without sweat glands. He did, however, have his own form of air conditioning. Some folks did not like it, unfortunately. His method was called breaking wind. It wouldn't usually be a problem when he was alone, but he always noticed the angry faces around him when he used his personal air conditionaing in a crowded elevator. To his dismay, that is where he and several others were stuck. In a crowded elevator between the 7th and 8th floors. The air was getting rather sticky, and, just as sweating is involuntary, so was his personal air conditioner. He was glad, for the others' sake, that his air conditioner didn't go off very often. You see, his built-in system provided him with adequate cooling, but it was not continuous, as sweating is. A couple hours later, he finally let go, having let the pressure build up until the proper time. A loud sound, and then, screams of people gasping for air, could be heard in the elevator shaft. After a few minutes, he was the only one left standing; the rest were all unconscious from the noxious vapors.

 What Muppet Am I, continued Jennie took the test, too.

 Retribution His side was hurting so bad that it felt like a knife had been thrust in it. He doubled over from the pain, falling on the floor. He knew that last bowl of ice cream was going to do him in, yet in his pride and arrogance he ate it anyway. Now he was paying for it. With no one around, his cries for help went unheard. Minutes later, he awoke. Still on the floor, his side felt a little better, yet his head was throbbing. The only way, it seemed, to relieve the pain was to press on the affected areas as hard as he could. He would at times hit himself with his fists.

 The Winner? Thanks to my old high school classmate LH for this email. An old native American Grandfather said to his grandson, who came to him with anger toward a friend who had done him an injustice: "Let me tell you a story. I too, at times, have felt a great hate for those that have taken so much, with no sorrow for what they have done. But hate wears you down, and does not hurt your enemy. It is like taking poison and wishing your enemy would die. I have struggled with these feelings many times." He continued, "It is as if there are two wolves inside me; one is good and does no harm. He lives in harmony with all around him and does not take offense when no offense was intended. He will only fight when it is right to do so, and in the right way. He saves all his energy for the right fights. But the other wolf, ah! He is full of anger. The littlest thing will set him into a fit of temper. He fights everyone, all the time, for no reason. He cannot think because his anger and hate are so great. It is helpless anger, for his anger will change nothing. Sometimes it is hard to live with these two wolves inside me, for both of them try to dominate my spirit." The boy looked intently into his Grandfather's eyes and asked, "Which one wins, Grandfather?" The Grandfather smiled and quietly said, "The one I feed." -- Native American Author Unknown

 Health | Ending Self-Injury from the urlLink Lysamena Project on Self-Injury Well, folks, I am in need of some baring of the soul here. Since I was about seven years old, I have engaged in self-injury practices. Specifically, if I've had a cut or scab of some kind, I struggle with just letting it heal. I have trouble resisting the urge to pick at scabs. I am currently seeking medical help for this and some other mental stuff that I'm dealing with (namely, ADHD, obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorder, depression). I know that what I'm doing to my body isn't normal, and I know that it affects those around me. I get embarrassed by the scabs and scars on my body. I did a urlLink Google Search on self injury and found this web page, about urlLink ending self-injury . It is categorized under urlLink Health > Mental Health > Disorders > Impulse Control > Self Injury . I am glad to be open about this, and I know that I'm not the only one struggling with it. I would love to be free from this habit right now, but I understand that it will take patience, time, and the hand of God. So I urge you to pray for me. Thanks.

I am not the type to chat with strangers in highway comfort stations, and I really don't know quite what possessed me, but anyway, I answered, a little embarrassed: "Not bad." And the stranger said: "And, what are you up to?" Talk about your dumb questions! I was really beginning to think this was too weird! So I said: "Well, I guess that just like you I'm driving east." Then, I heard the stranger, all upset, say, "Look, I'll call you back, there's some idiot in the next stall answering all the questions I am asking you."

 Dictionary.com | Word of the Day for Thursday May 9, 2002 urlLink protean \PRO-tee-un; pro-TEE-un\, adjective: 1. Displaying considerable variety or diversity. 2. Readily assuming different shapes or forms. The [Broadway] musical was ceaselessly protean in these years, usually conventional but always developing convention, twisting it, replacing it. --Ethan Mordden, [1]Coming Up Roses Roosevelt's performance in the civil rights meeting illustrated one of the central operating principles of his protean executive style, a style that transformed the presidency, and the nation: a willingness to delay decisions, change his mind, keep his options open, avoid commitments, or even deceive people in the relentless pursuit of noble objectives. --William Doyle, [2]Inside the Oval Office He was a protean character who constantly adapted to his environment. --David Maraniss, [3]The Clinton Enigma _________________________________________________________ Protean is derived from Proteus, an ancient Greek god who had the ability to change his shape at will.

 UGHHH! : I've been struggling with my PC here at work. Between server restarts, unwanted company email (I'm a contractor working onsite), and functionality that behaves one way one day and differently the next - it all can get frustrating. (blows off steam) I think I'm just gonna continue listening to my music and get as far as I can... In the words that my friend and brother MM told me: Keep on rollin', 18-wheeler.

 Tunage I'm currently listening to some CDs I bought last night: * O Brother, Where Art Thou? Soundtrack * U2: The Best of 1980-1990 It's been so long since I bought music for myself. I need music to keep the distractions around me down. Thank God for music!

 Traffic Bothers I tend to get upset by people in other cars who don't use turn signals. What often bugs me is when I'm waiting to make a turn, and an oncoming car looks as if it might turn, or maybe it won't. I can't tell until the very last moment. I know I'm impatient, but I could use that extra time to get where I want to go. Another thing that bugs me is when I'm behind someone and they slow down to turn - and don't use their turn signal! Or yet, those folks that are about to turn left and slow down without going into the middle, or "suicide" lane. Here these goofballs are, impeding the flow of traffic by their selfish driving. If someone's turn signals are out, that's no excuse! That's what hand signals are for! Geez! We need to learn this to take the cotton-pickin' driver's test, so why can't these people put their hand out and make a constructive gesture for once? Now, I've been guilty of these motoring "sins", so it's not good to cast the first stone if I'm not at fault. Yet I still think it's time... yes, it's time for all of us to change! Just be sure to signal.

"And, thus, for the next 30 minutes, they served coffee, lattes, and cappuccinos to drive-thru customers.

 Married and Faithful urlLink Jen , who urlLink recently signed my guestmap , urlLink posted some questions related to married people who struggle with infidelity. I do not consider myself to be an expert on marriage - I've only been married for 7 years - but since I do have a little bit of experience, I'll share what I believe. First of all, my wife and I are committed followers of Jesus Christ. We consider our individual relationships with God as paramount to any other relationship. Secondly, our relationship with each other is more important than family, friends, etc. Since our wedding day, we both have taken our vows seriously. The gushy emotions we felt during the first year of marriage have not persisted. It is the love we each have for God and for each other that has kept us together. 9 Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their work: 10 If one falls down, his friend can help him up. But pity the man who falls and has no one to help him up! 11 Also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm. But how can one keep warm alone? 12 Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken. -- Ecclesiastes 4:9-12 (NIV) Here is another way to look at it: God, my wife, and I are at each corner of a triangle. He does not move. As Jennie (my wife's name) and I move closer to God, we get closer to each other by default. So the key to having a healthy marriage is for each person to stay close to God. This relates to the subject of infidelity. Early in our marriage I used to believe that I wouldn't struggle with lust. After all, I'm married now! I was naive. As I mentioned before, the gushy feelings we had have not always been there, but our commitment to each other has. I have found that when I am not close to God, I tend to be open toward stuggles with lust. Remember the triangle: If we move away from God, we also move away from each other. Keeping a healthy marriage is hard work! One should not think it any other way. It involves daily renewing our vows. It also involves a lot of grace and forgiveness - from God and from each other. Having other spiritually mature couples in our lives has also been important. But most important of all, is our commitment to God. If you are interested in learning more about getting a better relationship with God, I can help. Feel free to contact me and leave a way that I can reply.

 2001 Darwin Awards | THINK BEFORE YOU LEAP "He who hesitates... lives!" July 2001, Idaho | His brakes failed while driving down a steep mountain road, so Marco bailed out on his eight passengers and leapt from his Dodge van. Too bad Marco didn't alert the others to the problem before he took flight so precipitously. Another passenger pulled the hand brake, bringing the vehicle to a stop a short distance away. Marco struck his head on the pavement and died at the scene. No one else was injured. South Idaho Press

 2001 Darwin Awards | INTERSECTING DARWINS "Two wrongs do make a right!" April 2001, Tennessee | One day before the US tax filing deadline, a Memphis Darwin Award winner trying to beat a train drove around the crossing gates -- only to be struck by an oncoming vehicle whose driver had the same mad plan. The driver of the first vehicle was killed, making this monumental stupidity the first instance we have witnessed of a Darwin Award winner crashing into an Honorable Mention. The accident happened to one side of the tracks, so the train passed by unimpeded. Memphis Commercial Appeal

 2001 Darwin Awards | CRYSTAL DAZE "Darwin and Newton share a laugh." Mexico is home to two hot caverns containing the largest natural crystals known to man. "Walking into either of these caves is like stepping into a (sweltering) gigantic geode," described one awed observer. Some of the translucent selenite crystals are over 20 feet long. The newly-discovered caverns, 1200 feet below Chihuahua, carry a curse for those who seek to plunder their riches. A man recently tried to steal one of the magnificent crystals from the roof, and might have succeeded... if he hadn't stood directly beneath it while chopping it free. He was crushed by the stalactite as it heeded the call of gravity. Reference: Discovery (Channel) News

 2001 Darwin Awards - Honorable Mention | SOBRIETY TEST May 2001 | In a poorly judged attempt to convince his wife he was sober enough to drive, a 29-year-old husband pulled up to a State Police barracks in his pickup truck, parked illegally, and demanded a sobriety check. He failed the Breathalyzer test and was taken into custody. "Basically," an amused Sergeant Paul Slevinski explained, "his wife won the argument." Southampton Press

 2001 Darwin Awards - Honorable Mention | TIED TO HIS WORK January 2001, Florida | A 24-year-old construction worker tied himself to a piece of scaffolding for safety while working on the 4th floor of the county jail annex. Forgetting he was attached to the metal, he tossed it to the ground, and was carried along for the ride. He landed on the scaffolding, which pierced both legs. He was treated for his injuries at Bayfront Medical Center in St. Petersburg, and hopefully counseled on the use of his most important safety tool: his brain. Sarasota Herald-Tribune

 Time Management - The Pickle Jar Theory urlLink A List Apart - for people who make websites . From new ALA contributing writer Jeremy Wright: "The latest theory of Time Management I heard has actually caused me to stop and think about how I run my entire life.

Now it's official: I no longer have a job with the company I've been working for the past three and a half years. Maybe it's a little weird - but I don't feel quite as bad as I did some weeks ago. Perhaps the anxiety of not knowing what was going to happen was worse than finding out.

 The Saga Continues: Ozone Action Day 4 Yes, my friends, another installment in, what promises to be a long running series here in the Miami Valley. "[In Ohio, Cleveland and Dayton] urlLink have called an ozone action day for Sunday, June 23rd 2002. From the urlLink Dayton Daily News : "DAYTON | Ah, the good old days. "It only seems like forever since mild pleasant weather has graced the Miami Valley. But if ever there was a time to be nostalgic, it is now, amid the suffocating heat that has been baking the area these past few days and which is expected to hang around for several more days."

 Dog Days of Summer - Already Disclaimer: Please do not read this if you have a delicate stomach or are eating or have just eaten. Two weeks ago we got a four-month old puppy. He's part Chocolate Lab and part Collie. We are struggling with killing this dog - over housebreaking. OK, I'm not serious about killing the dog - I'd never do that. But I am letting it upset me. We also bought a cage, in which he sleeps. The idea behind having Jake (the dog's name) sleep in the cage is based upon the dog's natural instinct not to relieve himself where he sleeps. We also put him in the cage whenever we go out of the house to go grocery shopping or whatever. Yet when we're at home, we let him out and take him outside to relieve himself. When he's inside, we need to make sure that he isn't unsupervised. He's been known to pee and poop from time to time. Case in point: Not even 10 minutes ago, we had just finished dinner, and I'm sitting here typing at the computer when I smell dog poop. I noticed that Jake had somehow gotten downstairs. I sent him back upstairs and looked around to see where the dog had been, and, sure enough, he left a poop pile on the carpet! I ran upstairs to get the pooper scooper and came back downstairs. As I approached to poop, the smell got to me. I felt it coming. So I ran to the garbage can and threw up . Tasha, the deaf woman who, with her 10 month old son, lives in this area of the house, took the pooper scooper and went to pick it up. Then she started gagging. I knew what was coming for her, and of course, that prompted the gag reflex in me. So I ran to the stationary tub and threw up two more times . Then Tasha came running to the downstairs bathroom, which is located next to the stationary tubs, and vomited . Hearing her vomiting again prompted the gag reflex in me again, and I threw up two more times . Keisha, our four-year old daughter, just attempted to come downstairs. I told her to stay upstairs. She isn't wearing her hearing aids, so she said, "What?" and I heard her begin the descent. "Stay upstairs, Keisha!" Then I yelled, just to make sure she heard me, "STAY UPSTAIRS, KEISHA!!!" ( I'm such a sensitive dad, aren't I? ) Then she went running, crying to her mom. "Daddy's mad at me, Mommy!" Soon afterward, Tasha came downstairs, with a t-shirt tied around her mouth and nose (I wish I had the camera), and heroically used the pooper scooper to clean up the mess. Immediately, she put it, pooper scooper and all , in a plastic bag. At first I told her that we needed to keep the pooper scooper (I'm having fun typing that, by the way), but then I realized that it was better over all, at least for the short term, to have the mess out of the house. Later, Tasha came back down with some Lysol (TM, just in case it's needed, you know) cleaner and cleaned up the area. Well, I think I need to go soon. I need to floss my teeth, if you know what I mean.

 Silliness: "The Computer..." This afternoon my four year old daughter Keisha and I were making a birthday card on the computer for one of her friends. We had to wait for the computer to boot up, so I used this opportunity to kid around with her. Below is how our conversation went: D: The computer is waking up. K: NO!!! The computer's not waking up! D: Oh! I see! Well, then the computer is taking a bath. K: NO!!! The computer doesn't take a bath! D: Well, the computer needs to go potty... K: NO!!! You silly! The computer doesn't go potty! D: Well, the computer has to eat breakfast... K: NO! By this time, she started getting into it, and more silliness erupted. Later this evening, at the dinner table, I mentioned this to my wife Jennie and our friend Tasha, and we continued the silliness: J: I know! The computer has to wash the dishes! K: NO!!! T: The computer is my fiance. D: The computer needs a spanking. K: NO!!! The computer goes to McDonald's! T: The computer and Keisha go to the McDonald's and play in the play area together. J: The computer needs to go for a walk. D: The computer needs his diaper changed. And so on... Can you add to the silliness? Fill in the blank: The computer...

 Ozone Action Day 2 More from the urlLink Dayton Daily News : "Summer [arrived at 9:24 am this morning] with a warning: If you have respiratory problems, stay indoors. "The urlLink Regional Air Pollution Control Agency late Thursday issued for the second consecutive day an 'Ozone Action Day,' or smog alert, for today. Jim Gross, supervisor of monitoring and analysis, said that means there will be elevated ozone concentrations over the valley-trapped combinations of pollutants, mostly from automobile emissions. "Temperatures will rise to the upper 80s today and near 90 Saturday under mostly sunny skies. Overnight lows will be in the mid- to upper 60s. More clouds late in the weekend should bring a chance of a shower or thunderstorm." I really didn't feel like mowing the lawn this afternoon anyway. I think I'll wait until evening.

 So, You Think Your Job Is Bad? Note: A while back a friend forwarded this to me. I cannot vouch for its validity and its presentation here is not meant to be authoritative. When you have an "I hate my job" day try this: On your way home from work, stop at your pharmacy and go to the thermometer section. You will need to purchase a rectal thermometer made by "Q-tip" Be very sure that you get this brand. When you get home, lock your doors, draw the drapes and disconnect the phone so you will not be disturbed during your therapy. Change to very comfortable clothing, such as a sweat suit and lie down on your bed. Open the package and remove the thermometer. Carefully place it on the bedside table so that it will not become chipped or broken. Take out the written material that accompanies the thermometer and read it. You will notice that in small print there is a statement: "Every rectal thermometer made by Q-tip is personally tested."

 Credit Bureau Personal Information - How to Opt Out Just wanted to let everyone know who still hasn't already heard, the three major credit bureaus in the US (Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion) have been allowed, as of July 1, 2001, to release our credit info, mailing addresses, phone numbers..... to anyone who requests it. If you would like to 'opt out' of this release of info, you can call 1-888-567-868 (1-888-5-OPT-OUT). It only takes a couple of minutes to do, and you can take care of others in your household while making only one call, you'll just need to know their social security numbers. Be sure to listen closely, the first opt out is only for 2 years, but you may want to make sure you wait until they prompt you to press '3' on your keypad to opt out for good. However, this number is not associated with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which has allowed banks and other financial institutions to sell your private financial information since July 1, 2001. Calling 1-888-5-OPT-OUT will not stop your bank, credit union, brokerage company, etc. from selling your information. For that, you must respond individually to the "Privacy Policy" statements you received in the mail or you must call the financial institution or company yourself. Those "Privacy Policy" statements tend to get mixed in with the other "Junk Mail" you receive from your financial institutions. This link takes you to a list of some credit card companies and financial institutions and their individual 'opt-out' numbers: urlLink http://www.clarkhoward.com/topics/opt_out.html

 Bad Web Page Design Let me preface what I'm going to say with this: I do not claim to be a web design expert - my skills for it have not yet matured. As a user, however, I do feel I can comment when I have a bad visit to a web site. Case in point: urlLink The History of Braniff Airways -- Not only do you need to have a super size monitor with a larger than 1024x768 screen resolution, but you get to see a scrolling marquee that at first appears to be a button -- among many other things. I discovered this website from Vincent Flanders's website called urlLink "Examples of Bad Web Design" .

 Forbes.com Digital Slide Show: Making Yoda Walk "NEW YORK - When George Lucas began his original Star Wars trilogy, released in 1977, he had to force real-world materials--latex, stone and cloth--to match the fantastic planets and creatures that filled his imagination. With urlLink Star Wars: Episode II--Attack Of The Clones , Lucas was able to dispense with those pedestrian constraints altogether. His special-effects specialists at Industrial Light & Magic had learned to create strange aliens and environments inside their computers." I loved the movie, especially this part, where we get to see why Yoda is a Jedi Master! urlLink This slide show is worth a peek.

 Update on me It's been a while since I've been able to post anything " substantial " (I used that word, tongue-in-cheek, since there are those who may wonder if * anything * I post here is substantial). So, a brief update is in order (you know, the sometimes obligatory 'sorry I haven't posted in awhile but here's why' message)... Tomorrow (Friday, 6/14) is my last day at my current consulting assignment. On Monday I get to return to my company's office to be "on the bench", as it is called. Too much to go into here about how all this has happened, but you may be able to get a clue from reading recent posts to urlLink Letters to God . I have not been online very much lately, and when I am, I usually have had just enough time to check email and other stuff. I haven't subscribed to urlLink BloggerPro , but I do sometimes email myself a potential post from work. You may find that urlLink Letters to God and urlLink Quotes Blog have been updated more frequently than this one. So, I guess that's it for now. I appreciate those of you who have boldly come to take this " urlLink Journey Inside My Mind ". Maybe you'll find something here that you can take with you. Keep in touch!

 Guestmap OK. Something doesn't sound right. I just checked out urlLink my guestmap found a link that appears to describe the traffic to my guestmap. What I wanna know is, if there are so many visitors to my guestmap, why aren't they signing it?

 urlLink Blogrolling.com : WARNING FOR BLOGGER USERS! "Blogger has recently changed their publishing engine and the CDATA tags in the code that Blogrolling used to generate will basically kill your template. This seems to be a side effect of the new system they have. I have updated the code generator to strip these tags out until the new version is finished." Darn.

 The Difference between Men And Women from urlLink Acesonline.org "Let's say a guy named Roger is attracted to a woman named Elaine. He asks her out to a movie; she accepts; they have a pretty good time. A few nights later he asks her out to dinner, and again they enjoy themselves. They continue to see each other regularly, and after a while neither one of them is seeing anybody else." That's just the beginning of this hilarious illustration! urlLink Read more... So true...

 There is certainly an over-abundance of anecdotal "religious" chain e-mails clogging up many of our inboxes already, and in my opinion most are either overly sentimental to the point of manipulative, completely fictional (not factual, like the Bible), or downright doctrinally unsound. And of course most include the none-too-subtle hint (threat) near the end that failure to propagate them further indicates a lack of love for Jesus and/or your friends. I love both, and yet I refuse to circulate the vast majority of those which I receive.

 I have been out of it for the past few days. I went to the doctor on Saturday for a sore throat, and he diagnosed me with the onset of a sinus infection. The symptoms went away for a bit later that day. Then, on Sunday night, my head started hurting - I could tell my sinuses were filling up. (I know... yuk!) I called into work late Sunday night to tell them I wouldn't be coming in on Monday. Then I spent most of Monday asleep. I didn't even go outside yesterday. I barely ate anything: two slices of peanut butter toast, two tacos and a helping of green beans. For the entire day, that's all I ate. Then I went to bed last night feeling slightly better. But when I woke up this morning, I said, "No way", and I called into work again sick. Sinus infections wear me out. I think it is mainly the sinus headaches. Time to draw near to God... I definitely haven't been myself; that's for sure.

 Members of Mainline Congregation Join New York City Church of Christ from urlLink Kingdom News Network ...and a large number of priests became obedient to the faith ( urlLink Acts 6:7 ). Roberto Carrillo writes: Last summer I received a name and phone number for a person who was interested in coming to church. This, of course, happens rather regularly. This particular person, however, was no regular individual; He was the lead evangelist of a traditional Church of Christ congregation in New Jersey, a congregation which was one of the fastest-growing congregations among the mainline Churches of Christ. The congregation had been studying many different urlLink DPI publications over the previous year, and had been attempting to imitate our Bible talks, studies and discipling principles. He and the other evangelists and their wives began to visit midweek services. They came with many doubts and fears, having heard much of the gossip and criticism about the urlLink International Churches of Christ . urlLink more>>

 Deaf Culture I have had the pleasure of meeting a good number of deaf people. One of the more interesting aspects of communicating with them in sign language is the concept of a "sign name," which I'll explain briefly. In order to keep from having to fingerspell a person's name every time you mention them, it's easier to have a "sign name." This consists of the fingerspelled first letter of the person's name and an action associated with that person. Whenever I've asked one of my deaf friends to give someone else to whom we're talking a sign name, they usually ask, "What does he/she like to do?" In other words, if you had one activity or word to describe you, what would that be? My wife Jennie, for example, has a beautiful smile. Keisha, our 5-year old daughter, has curly hair. I really enjoy playing and listening to music. So our sign names, respectively, with the right hand, are a fingerspelled "J" across the right side of the face (smile), a fingerspelled "K" by the right side of the head in a curling motion (curly hair), and a fingerspelled "D" in a figure-eight motion across the left arm (music).

 A Lesson to be Learned I live in Dayton, Ohio, and I've driven along the roads mentioned in this article. urlLink Dayton Daily News: Police chase ends when suspect's prosthetic leg falls off . The man was trying to steal some lawn mowers. I loved what urlLink Neal Boortz said on his radio show yesterday about this story. The lesson to be learned here is this: If you have a prosthetic leg and try to run from the police, chances are that they have real legs.

 My Earliest Memory, TV Superheroes, and I Have Bionic Parts urlLink Melanie from "The Topics Blog" asks, "What was the worst thing that you have ever experienced physically?" All right, then. Here goes. This is a little personal , and maybe a little gross -- consider yourself warned . This event happens to be my earliest memory . I was three years old and I had received an operation to repair a hernia in my groin. The problem arose when I had an allregic reaction to the catgut stitches that the surgeons used to knit me back up. The area got infected and, before I could get the stitches out, they needed to get all the pus out. I remember this scene vividly because when they pushed to squeeze the pus out, the pain was excruciating ! I remember screaming and crying because it hurt so bad. I felt helpless. After the experience was over, the hospital people gave me a Batman colorforms set for " being so brave ". In addition to Batman , some of my other favorite TV shows were Shazaam! and The Six Million Dollar Man . Sometimes, Mom would safety pin a towel on my back, and I would race down the steps to our front door and cry out, " Shazaam! ", just like the main character did on the show. Then I would go around looking for problems to fix, bad guys to beat up, and so on. At other times, I would play with my Steve Austin, Six Million Dollar Man, action figure. It even had a magnifying glass so that I could look through his right eye, just like the "real" Steve Austin did on TV. I remember after coming home from the hospital, we had a family reunion of some type at our house. Well, I was just so proud, having come off the operating table, that I went around telling people that I, too, had bionic parts inside me . And I was just about to show someone by climbing up in one of the trees in front of our house, when Dad caught me. From that moment throughout my childhood I was not allowed to climb any trees. I thought Dad just didn't believe, but now I realize that he did want me to go back to the hospital so soon after coming home. I cannot remember, but maybe a jump like that is what led to my operation in the first place.

 Get That Job! I am pleased to announce the launch of "Get That Job!", a weblog devoted entirely to the job search. The idea is to have many contributors - i.e., not just me - who can post to the page. It could be a snippet of advice, a good quote from somewhere, some encouragement, success stories, job market information, etc. This idea is similar to the one at urlLink The End of Free . So, if you happen to be interested in contributing, let me know by urlLink emailing me , adding a comment(aka guidepost, see the end of this post), urlLink signing the guestmap , or urlLink signing the guestbook . Also, if you know someone else who may be interested, then let me know about them as well. I will need valid email addresses so that I can set you up to contribute. Maybe you or others aren't interested in being regular contributors but would like to contribute occasionally. In that case urlLink email me with whatever you have and it will be considered for posting here.

 Sleep Study Last Friday, Jen, who blogs to Thinking by Smell, urlLink wrote about being in a sleep study . That's interesting. I was part of a sleep study over ten years ago when I lived in the Detroit, Michigan area. The researchers were testing to see how drowsy a person taking Benadryl gets. The first week was going to be a baseline test (i.e., a control test) I was told that I could not take in any caffeine or chocolate 12 hours before I was to go in. They should have just put me in jail or something. I went in at the approved time and also went to a "hook up" room. Shortly after they turned off the lights, I was out. They woke me up in the morning, and boy, did I feel wasted. They let me eat breakfast, but I was not to drink any caffeine still. After the breakfast break, I went to a computer terminal and had to take this manual dexterity test. I was supposed to get a perfect score, considering I hadn't been given any of the Benadryl. But because I was still so sleepy, every cell in my body begging for rest, I didn't get a good score. Later that week, I received a check in the mail and was told that they would not need me any more for the current sleep study. I know it was because I was a poor control guinea pig. I've considered participating in additional studies because participants get paid. Maybe soon...

 Our Ballerina Keisha, as one of her 5 year old birthday presents, began dance class last night. She was so hyped!! And proud, too! I get so encouraged when she shows us what she's learned. She made a new friend, and she invited her and her mom to come to our church... Jennie was so inspired by that. Me too! Some people need to be told to evangelize, but this girl did it out of the bottom of her heart. She was like this as we approached her birthday party, which was last Friday-Saturday (another post altogether). Anyone we'd meet, whether at church, while shopping, at the doctor's office, at the library - she'd ask them if they would come to her birthday party. We'd only invited five other girls, so when Keisha did this, we'd have to make sure these people knew that it had already been planned. Still, we are so fired up about our daughter's natural exuberance! It's as though whenever she walks into the room, she needs to make sure others know that she's arrived. Now I understand that this behavior can be taken to the extreme and appear conceited. Yet she has a magnetism that naturally draws people to her. That's a great quality!

 Take me out to the ball game On Monday night, my friend BI took me to see the Cincinnati Reds vs. the Pittsburgh Pirates. It was the first time I've seen a Reds game that close this year. This year, by the way, is the last year that the Reds will be playing in Cinergy Field, formerly known as Riverfront Stadium. Next year they will be moving into their new ballpark, Great American Ballpark, named for Great American Insurance Company. In general, it was a terrific time. BI was the best man in my wedding, and I was a groomsman in his wedding. I still refer to him as 'the best man' . The Reds lost 6-5.

 So little time, so much to blog I need to make this brief, since I've got to get on with the job search, etc. So stay tuned...

 Music, Music, and more Music In addition to cleaning out email, this morning I've been organizing the music on my PC. I have a boatload of it, and sometime, I'll have to list the artists that I have. I think it's rather eclectic.

 Family Tree Research Ah yes, another one of my hobbies. I am always intrigued by those who have been successful in this venture. I used to work with someone who would plan his summer vacations as a result of his research; going to ancestors' hometowns, etc. I recently checked out Family Tree Maker's software from the local public library. Now I need to set time to check it out. I also found urlLink this article , first is a series, about doing geneaology research.

 I want to learn about .NET, continued Many of these links I'm posting have come from old emails I received from former coworkers. The comments I include here are from one person. urlLink Webcasts : "These are great. You can watch previously recorded webcasts or participate in a live web cast. Also, I have been able to download a previously recorded webcast and view it when I am not attached to the network.

The ASP.NET QuickStart is a series of ASP.NET samples and supporting commentary designed to quickly acquaint developers with the syntax, architecture, and power of the ASP.NET Web programming framework. The QuickStart samples are designed to be short, easy-to-understand illustrations of ASP.NET features." urlLink MSDN : "MSDN has an ample amount of .NET stuff to learn. A good place to look at is the six-week orientation for all things .NET. Each week, we will focus on a particular aspect of .NET development, supported by articles, samples, how-tos, chats, and Webcasts." Also, there is somewhere something called the "Partner readiness Advisor for Visual Basic .NET and .NET Development." This contains information about ADO,net, c#, .net, asp.net, web services and the execution of the .net platform. In order to open it, you need IE 6.0. If anyone out there knows where I can find this "Partner readiness Advisor", please let me know and I'll update this post.

 Online Web Tutorials That's right! "Completely Free Web Building Tutorials !! "Inside urlLink W3Schools you will find a large number of free Web building tutorials, from basic HTML and XHTML tutorials, to advanced XML, XSL, and WAP tutorials."

 How to Use the Blogger API Cleaning out my email, I noticed a message from February 2002 in which I had included urlLink Meg's link on how she used the Blogger API . I have no clue yet as to why I'd use the Blogger API, but I thought it would make a good reference. If anyone has already implemented it - other than Meg, of course - let me know. I don't understand how or why it would be beneficial, so let me know what you think.

 Save a buck for information The Personal Finance section of the paper copy of today's urlLink Dayton Daily News reports the following: "How do you find a telephone number for a government agency based in Columbus or elsewhere in the state? Such as [the] Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles? "Ask your telephone service's 'Information, Please' and the answer fee can be $1 or more. "If the Ohio department or agency is not listed in the telephone directory's white pages under 'State Government,' dial 285-6600. "That number connects [you with] 'Dial direct to all departments.' Operators then connect you toll-free to the state agency you want to ask information."

 urlLink Site Meter From the "That's Just Weird" department, I offer this: I just checked my urlLink site meter statistics for urlLink this blog and found out that one of the entry pages to the site was the urlLink International Atomic Agency . Also, apparently because urlLink this post was about a "403 Forbidden" error I was getting some time ago, it showed up in Google's search results for "Forbidden You were denied access because Access denied by access control list". Things that make you go, hmm...

 Time Management I'm reading a book I got from the library about non-traditional methods of time management. I like it because it takes into account people like me, who don't often think of time linearly, which is how much of our day tends to be structured. For instance, I would find a job on an assembly line almost unbearable because I'd find it dull, boring, monotonous, routine, mind-cramping, brain-atrophying... and so on. I also like the book because there are some great quotations that I plan to add to my urlLink QuotesBlog . Stay tuned!

 Five Years Ago I am, for some odd reason, still awake, even though it's after 3 AM On Thursday, July 17, 1997, at 10:42 PM, our daughter urlLink Keisha Renee was born. This occurred after much hard work and perseverance. And, oh yes, my wife was there, too! (just kidding, Jen!) Seriously though -- seeing my wife go through labor generated a whole new dimension of respect for her in me. I am glad that I will never have to experience that! I may actually reveal some details about what happened prior to the delivery that day... at some later date. Tonight we went to urlLink Max and Erma's on Miller Lane to celebrate. We all got dressed up: I in my suit and tie from earlier today; urlLink Jennie in a nice outfit that made her look even more beautiful, and Keisha in a nice light blue dress, sporting a tiara and some earrings her speech therapist brought over today. "Princess" Keisha was beaming as she walked around and sat down. We let her open two presents as we ate dessert. She exclaimed, "I'm so happy!" after she opened them up to find a Barbie and a baby care accessory case for her doll baby Hannah. (Baby Hannah, by the way, is practically an additional member of the family, thanks to our daughter. We, however, left her in the car seat, locked up in the car with the windows closed . I am glad that she is only a doll because we sure could have gotten in trouble!!! lol) I am continually amazed at the miracle we see in our daughter Keisha, our gift from God. For it was only a short time ago that I held her in the crook of my arm, rocking her to sleep. I miss those times when I'd lay her on my chest and we'd both fall asleep on the couch. Now she's 44 inches tall, and I can barely pick her up. She also wants more of her independence. From what I've heard, this is just the beginning...

 Pet Peeve -- Ohio Bicentennial License Plates Ohio will be celebrating its bicentennial in 2003. Last September, Ohio began issuing Bicentennial license plates to help commemorate the occasion. They have red, white, and blue on them, which also makes it patriotic. These license plates have been a hit, especially considering the renewed patriotism in America. The designers of this license plate have had to make some changes in the layout to accomodate the additional information. One of these changes is the county where the license plate holder lives. (Growing up, our family would often travel from Cincinnati to Toledo where my dad grew up. One of the ways we'd pass the time is to notice the license plates of the cars around us. We'd be interested in those from out of state and those from Canada (Ontario), and we'd also notice the different Ohio counties represented. This tradition is something we still whenever we drive. It was easy to note which cars are from which county because it was spelled out on the bottom center of the license plate.) The Ohio Bicentennial license plate now has a small square county sticker with a number corresponding to the alphabetical order of the county in the list of all 88 counties. For example, I live in Dayton, Ohio, which is in Montgomery county. In the alphabetical list Montgomery is the 57th county. I often travel to Cincinnati and back, so I pass through Warren (83), Butler (09), and Hamilton (31). Now, below this large number is the name of the county, but it is in very small letters. These numbers are fine and dandy if you've memorized the alphabetical list of the counties. But who in Ohio has done that? My guess is that very few, if any, know them all by memory. (Actually, this was something we had to memorize when I was studying Ohio history in junior high school. At the time, I didn't think I would need to remember.) My fellow Ohioans don't appreciate me tailgating them to see which county they are from. So, what am I to do? Well, I have compiled the alphabetical list for me personally, and for whomever else is interested. So here goes: 01 ADAMS 45 LICKING 02 ALLEN 46 LOGAN 03 ASHLAND 47 LORAIN 04 ASHTABULA 48 LUCAS 05 ATHENS 49 MADISON 06 AUGLAIZE 50 MAHONING 07 BELMONT 51 MARION 08 BROWN 52 MEDINA 09 BUTLER 53 MEIGS 10 CARROLL 54 MERCER 11 CHAMPAIGN 55 MIAMI 12 CLARK 56 MONROE 13 CLERMONT 57 MONTGOMERY 14 CLINTON 58 MORGAN 15 COLUMBIANA 59 MORROW 16 COSHOCTON 60 MUSKINGUM 17 CRAWFORD 61 NOBLE 18 CUYAHOGA 62 OTTAWA 19 DARKE 63 PAULDING 20 DEFIANCE 64 PERRY 21 DELAWARE 65 PICAWAY 22 ERIE 66 PIKE 23 FAIRFIELD 67 PORTAGE 24 FAYETTE 68 PREBLE 25 FRANKLIN 69 PUTNAM 26 FULTON 70 RICHLAND 27 GALLIA 71 ROSS 28 GEAUGA 72 SANDUSKY 29 GREENE 73 SCIOTO 30 GUERNSEY 74 SENECA 31 HAMILTON 75 SHELBY 32 HANCOCK 76 STARK 33 HARDIN 77 SUMMIT 34 HARRISON 78 TRUMBULL 35 HENRY 79 TUSCARAWAS 36 HIGHLAND 80 UNION 37 HOCKING 81 VAN WERT 38 HOLMES 82 VINTON 39 HURON 83 WARREN 40 JACKSON 84 WASHINGTON 41 JEFFERSON 85 WAYNE 42 KNOX 86 WILLIAMS 43 LAKE 87 WOOD 44 LAWRENCE 88 WYANDOT

 Winning is Important!!! I know some who say that it's not important whether you win or lose, but it's how you play the game. Well, we urlLink got one of those last night in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA , as, for the first time since 1961, the Major League Baseball All-Star Game ended with a tie: National League 7, American League 7. As a fan, I don't agree with that above statement. I feel cheated. I am from Cincinnati, and the urlLink Reds urlLink had one player, urlLink Adam Dunn , a former Dayton Dragon, on the National League team. Given that in the last several All-Star Games, the AL won, that the NL was so close to winning hurts more. Oh, I'll get over it. In fact, in the grand scheme of things, it's not that big of a deal. Yet I can't help feeling robbed. Major League Baseball, since the strike of 1994, has not been that appealing. Then we get a no-decision like we had last night. Now there is talk of a strike this year. Oh, great. A glimmer of hope has been the arrival of minor league baseball in Dayton, Ohio. Fifth Third Field, which seats over 8,000, is always packed, and the Dragons always provide an entertaining experience. This feels like baseball the way it was when I grew up. I remember the Big Red Machine of the 70's fondly. My hero was George Foster. When I played Little League, I had his number (3) and played his position (Left Field). I nevertheless couldn't hit very well, and he was a slugger. I guess we weren't meant to be alike in every way. How will this season end up? The Reds are in a pennant race for the NL Central division with the St. Louis Cardinals. I'd love to see them win the division. Whether we'll get a chance to see this depends on the outcome of the strike talks and how the teams fare. I just hope someone wants to win.

 Personal Example Counts "Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers." -- urlLink 1 Timothy 4:16 (NIV) I am outraged by the events urlLink depicted in this story . If the events are found to be true, then we have another case of so-called "Christians" giving Christianity a bad name by their bad example, which will neither save them nor their hearers.

 How literature has influenced our speech today urlLink b-may points out that he "couldn't help but notice all the turns of phrase and common references the play has added to even today's everyday conversation." The play he's referring to his Shakespeare's urlLink Macbeth . I remember way back in high school our senior English class studied this play. I was really into jazz music, and I also remember listening to the urlLink Manhattan Transfer's album Vocalese . The song "Sing Joy Spring" has the lyric: What was it from MacBeth ? "Life's but a walking shadow a player poor that struts and frets upon the stage and's seen no more A tale that truly has an idiotic ring That's full of lotsa sound and fury signifying nothing..."

 5 things you wouldn't know about me from reading my blog 1. I can play the saxophone. 2. I was in the top 1% of my high school graduating class. 3. I was voted "Most Likely to Succeed" in high school. 4. I have never been further west than San Antonio, Texas, USA 5. The only foreign country I've ever visited was Canada (Windsor, Ontario) - wait a minute... are they still a foreign country or have we annexed them yet? (lol) Thanks to urlLink Mike for the idea and also encourage others to do this.

 Famous ENFJs It's always cool urlLink to learn that there are famous people out there that I can relate to. Famous ENFJs: David, King of Israel U.S. Presidents: Abraham Lincoln Ronald Reagan Others William Cullen Bryant, poet Abraham Maslow, psychologist and proponent of self-actualization Ross Perot Sean Connery Elizabeth Dole Francois Mitterand Bob Saget, America's Funniest Home Videos, Full House Dick Van Dyke Andy Griffith James Garner William Aramony, former president of United Way Gene Hackman, actor ( Superman, Antz ) Brenda Vaccaro Randy Quaid, actor ( Bye Bye, Love; Independence Day ) Peyton Manning, Indianapolis Colts quarterback Fictional ENFJs: Joe Hackett, Wings

 Bloginality Update I mentioned urlLink earlier that I needed to find out what my Bloginality was. I actually took the Myer-Briggs Type Indicator test in the fall of 1997 when I was in between jobs to help me on my job search. My type then was ENFJ. Now I'm looking for a job again, so... let's see whether it has changed or not (takes some time to take the test): My urlLink Bloginality is still urlLink ENFJ !!! Let's urlLink find out a little bit about what this means: "The dynamic nature of their intuition moves ENFJs from one project to another with the assurance that the next one will be perfect, or much more nearly so than the last. ENFJs are continually looking for newer and better solutions to benefit their extensive family, staff, or organization." I'd have to say that is just how I feel about moving on from my previous job.

 Return to Sender urlLink PC World New Zealand : "Using free email services, such as Hotmail and Yahoo Mail, is no longer as easy and fun as it once was... Back in March Yahoo changed its privacy policy to allow it to contact users in all kinds of ways by email, mail or even phone. It also reset users' 'personal profile' settings by adding and pre-selecting a new set of marketing option boxes. This was done to 'make it easier for you to manage the marketing communications you receive from Yahoo'. Funny, for something that is supposed to be good for me that doesn't sound like any fun at all... "Unfortunately it's not just Yahoo that has adopted this policy. A growing number of Hotmail's 118 million users worldwide report the same thing. The boxes make it appear people have given permission for Hotmail to share their email address, date of birth and other information with websites run by Microsoft's partners. I recently told a good friend and Hotmail user about this and he rushed to change his personal settings and preferences reasoning that if they weren't going to protect his privacy, why should he give away accurate personal information? "Microsoft also wanted access to a huge database of names which they have of course but like my friend earlier, a lot of the names are bogus. I have no doubt they'd prefer a smaller, accurate database of paying clients than a few million billgatessux@hotmail.com fakes." To change your Personal Profile in Hotmail , login and navigate to the Options page. Under the "Your Information" section is the item "Personal Profile". Click it to change your personal information and uncheck the boxes that say you don't mind sharing your information with Microsoft and its partners. To change your information in Yahoo , login and click the link to Mail Options. Click on the link to Account Information. I had to re-enter my password and ignore a stupid demographic survey. I clicked the Edit button next to the Member Information section, changed the information, and clicked to update it. I then clicked the Edit button for the Contact information section and changed that information. Then I clicked the link to "edit my marketing preferences". I made sure that every No choice was selected, that the checkboxes to indicate that they are not supposed to contact me via postal mail or by telephone are checked. Then I finally clicked the Save Changes button. Whew!

 Bulk E-mail Forwarding? OK. I just came up with an idea, but I don't know how to implement it. I have a "boatload" of email in one account. I would like to move it all to a different email account, but I don't want to open each message and forward it to the new address. Is there a way to bulk forward email to another address? How could this work with web-based email such as Hotmail and Yahoo? I appreciate your thoughts. Please add a guidepost. Thanks much!

 Huge Wins for the Cincinnati Reds and Dayton Dragons Both Cincinnati and Dayton have something to be excited about as we head into Independence Week. Today's urlLink Dayton Daily News reports that yesterday the urlLink Reds (43-37, or a .5375 winning percentage) came within percentage points of tying the urlLink St. Louis Cardinals (42-36, or a .5384 winning percentage) for first place in the National League Central Division. The Reds, you may recall, were predicted not to amount to much in the preseason. Yet they have not given up and are part of what hopes to be an exciting pennant race for the second half of the baseball season. Part, if not most, of the reason the Reds are doing so well may be in the young talent they have raised up from their minor league affiliates. Why, it was only recently, when Adam Dunn, Austin Kearns, and Juan Encarnacion were playing A-ball for the urlLink Dayton Dragons in at Fifth Third Field. Now look at these guys. urlLink Adam Dunn was the only Cincinnati Red chosen for the All-Star team . Austin Kearns urlLink could be Rookie of the Year . And what of those urlLink Dayton Dragons ? Today's urlLink Dayton Daily News also reports that the Dragons, with a 4-3 victory over the Fort Wayne Wizards yesterday, have extended their winning streak to 13 games. One has to wonder if this is the same team that was in second-to-last place after the first half of the season. Now, since the beginning of the second half, with a clean slate, the Dragons are hot! It seems that everything is coming together for the minor league team: pitching, fielding, and hitting. One player of note is outfielder Chris Williamson. In his last three games he has produced three homers and 12 RBIs to go with a .415 batting average. Even with all the great things happening for the team, the players are still forced to keep things in perspective. As Williamson puts it: "We're not all here about winning championships. We're here to develop players." We certainly have witnessed the results in Dunn, Kearns, and Encarnacion. Keep it up, guys. I certainly am enjoying it.

 Baring My Soul, Part 5 - Je Parles Francais urlLink Erica wants to know if I can communicate in another language besides English and to try writing an entire post on my blog in that foreign language. Since I cannot post in sign language, I might as well attempt in French. Here goes: Bonjour, mon nom est Daniel Johnson. J'tais n dans Cincinnati, Ohio. J'actuellement habite dans Dayton, Ohio avec ma femme et ma fille. Nous avons un chien qui a nomm Jake. Keisha a cinq ans, et elle est beaucoup le regarder en avant l'aller l'cole. Me, je ne travaille pas maintenant. Ce Juin, j'ai perdu mon travail. Je suis en train du trouver l'autre travail. Je suis programmeur. Pouvez-vous me comprendre? Si non, alors vous pouvez utiliser le website au " urlLink Freetranslation.com " traduire mon mots. S'il vous plat me permettre de sait que vous pensez il. Meri beaucoup.

 Baring My Soul, Part 4: Children's Naming Rights urlLink Erica inquires about the names we give our children, why we chose them, and so on. We have only one child: our daughter Keisha Renee. No one in our family has that name. My maternal grandmother's name was Loraine, but we thought - especially after consulting my wife - that Keisha Loraine was not a good idea - punny , but not the best choice (Ever heard of Quiche Lorraine?). Actually, the name Keisha Renee just came to me one day. It sounded beautiful. Some time after she was born I looked both names up in a baby name book. "Keisha" is derived from the same African-American word that means "newly created." "Renee" is French for "reborn." Hence, we've considered her name an inspiration from God: She was our "newly-created" child, and our desire is for her, when she gets old enough to make the decision to follow God for the rest of her life, that she will be "reborn." God has not yet allowed us to have any more children, but if we could have a son, we would name him Caleb William. We like "Caleb" because it means "faithful," after urlLink the man in the Old Testament with the same name . William was my father-in-law's name.

 Baring My Soul, Part 3 - Naming Rights urlLink Erin (air-in) would like to know if I was named after another person and why. When I was born, apparently my Dad wanted to name me Tyrone Hadley. Fortunately for me, my mom saw me first, and she chose instead to name me after my Dad. This turned out to be a great choice because it made him even more proud. My full name is Daniel Allen Johnson, Jr. Both my dad and I attended the University of Cincinnati's College of Engineering, and there were actually some times when I got his mail and he got mine. Since then, I've always made sure to use the "Jr." when I sign my name, etc.

 Baring My Soul, Part 2 - 15 Minutes (Or More) Of Fame urlLink Dan Johnson (who's that?) asks , "Have you ever been on television or in the newspaper? More than once? What for?" As a child I was on " urlLink The Uncle Al Show ," a local kids television show in Cincinnati. This past Christmas, Jennie, Keisha, and I were on the local news in Dayton, as part of a story about meeting a Santa Claus who signs for deaf and hard-of-hearing people. In 1993, I worked for the urlLink Salvation Army during their Christmastime Kettle Drive. Instead of ringing a bell, I played Christmas carols on my alto saxophone. This greatly cheered up the cashiers at the Kroger where I collected donations. They especially enjoyed my rendition of "O Holy Night." The urlLink Cincinnati Enquirer did a story about how donations were down, and they contacted the Salvation Army to find someone who demonstrated a lot of Christmas spirit. The Commander sent the photographer to me. On Christmas Eve 1993, I was on the front page of the Cincinnati Enquirer! In 1999 we and another family in Middletown went to urlLink Middfest , a cross-cultural celebration that takes place each October in Middletown, Ohio, where we lived. We had a great time, listening to the ethnic music. My daughter Keisha and our friends' daughter Rachel, both wore overalls that day. As the music played, I'd pick them up by the back of their overalls and swing them around. They enjoyed that a lot, and it got the attention of the news photographer. So, the next day, October 6th, there we all were, on the front page: I swinging both the girls at the same time.

 Baring My Soul, Part 1 - Remembering Important Dates urlLink Jenny M wonders if we remember important dates, like birthdays and anniversaries, how we remember, and whether we've ever gotten into trouble for not remembering. I am inconsistent in remembering important dates, like birthdays and anniversaries. Sometimes I've used my planner to keep track of these important dates, but when it comes to actually sending cards, etc., I am terrible. I cannot remember the last Mother's Day, Father's Day, Anniversary, or Birthday card I've mailed. I am better at making phone calls to people, however. Yet I can remember those dates for my wife, my daughter, and me. Note to self: Jennie's birthday is coming up at the end of October.

 Baring My Soul, Introduction courtesy of urlLink The Topics Blog In the next series of posts I will bare my soul by answering some of the posts I've found on urlLink The Topics Blog . I encourage you to check it out and do the same.

 The Most ADHD-type Album I've Heard This Year (subtitled - Should I Start Yet Another Blog?) BACKGROUND urlLink From CDD.gov Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common childhood behavioral disorders and can persist through adolescence and into adulthood. The causes are currently unknown. What is ADHD? According to the 2000 American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV-TR), ADHD is a Disruptive Behavior Disorder characterized by on-going inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity occurring in several settings and more frequently and severely than is typical for individuals in the same stage of development. Symptoms begin before age 7 years and can cause serious difficulties in home, school or work life. ADHD can be managed through behavioral or medical interventions, or a combination of the two. THE MOST ADHD-TYPE ALBUM I'VE HEARD THIS YEAR With the above, "official" definition in mind, I wanted to share that I finally listened to urlLink Tim McGraw's recent album "Set This Circus Down," and as I read the words to the songs, I was struck by how "ADHD" they sounded. I don't think that was the original intent, but this is probably a by-product of the recording. I'm sure many others have listened to it and provided their own reviews, but, since I am ADHD, I feel that I can relate a lot to this album. It's almost as though it describes my life, or the path, without conscious effort, that my life could take. Especially the Chorus from the first song, urlLink "The Cowboy In Me" , which was written by urlLink Craig Wisemand, Jeffery Steele, and Al Anderson : The urge to run the restlessness The heart of stone I sometimes get The things I've done for foolish pride The me that's never satisfied The face that's in the mirror when I don't like what I see I guess that's just the cowboy in me Aha! So that's what it is! It makes a little bit of sense, when you think about the original cowboy-types, who risked everything to go west and search for a better life. A lot of this ADHD behavior was indeed useful back then, right California? So, we descendents of these cowboys are now ADHD. Interesting, isn't it? SHOULD I START YET ANOTHER BLOG? Which brings me to my other thought. I already contribute to urlLink six blogs, five of which I own . (By the way, urlLink I'm still looking for contributors to Get That Job! ) I can see a potential for a blog related to ADD/ADHD. I suppose that my interest in separating the "mind spillage" is so that those on the " urlLink Journey Inside My Mind " may know that they can take a specific path if they so desire. If they want to search the urlLink quotes archive , then go there. If they want to read some urlLink creative writing , then by all means, knock yourself out. Should they desire to urlLink "Get That Job!" , then go for it. Care to read some of my urlLink "Letters to God" ? Don't let me hold you back. Or, if you're experiencing "Blogger's Block", then check out some urlLink potential blogging topics . If you want to urlLink experience the hodgepodge , then stick around here. I'm just wondering if I devoted an entire blog to ADHD, would people be interested in it and would I benefit from it. "I guess that's just the cowboy in me."

 Happy 8/28! also posted at urlLink Letters to God and urlLink QuotesBlog Today's date reminds me of one of my all-time favorite verses in the Bible, Romans 8:28 -- urlLink NIV : And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. urlLink NASB : And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose. urlLink KJV : And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. urlLink WE : We know that God works out everything for the good of those who love him. They are the people who are part of his plan. urlLink AMP : We are assured and know that [God being a partner in their labor] all things work together and are [fitting into a plan] for good to and for those who love God and are called according to [His] design and purpose.

 Survey courtesy of the urlLink Topics blog In no particular order (after the first), the urlLink five people who have had the biggest impact on my life are Jesus Christ , the incarnation of God, who lived a perfect life and urlLink died for me at just the right time My lovely and beautiful wife Jennie . I am still amazed that she loves me, but boy am I glad that she does. She helps me to see myself more for who I really am, especially when I'm down. She endures all my eccentricities, and somehow, through the grace of God, is learning to appreciate them. Through her I see a completely different side of God, and the differences I appreciate and marvel at. She is my best friend. My wonderful, darling daughter, Keisha Renee . Even as I write this, I feel tears welling within me. A gift from God, she is so much like me in her personality yet fortunately has her mom's good looks. I am learning so much about patience and gentleness from her, and through my relationship with her I have come to better understand my relationship with God, my Heavenly Father. My Dad , for whom I was named. I am so much like him, and I don't even have to try. I've been realizing this so much more as I've grown up into a husband and father. In addition to the same name, I have his sense of humor, 'interesting' outlook on life, and eclectic taste in music. I mentioned this to him one Christmas in a plaque I gave him. I spent my adolescent years with him, and to this day, he is one of the most important people in my life. My Mom , who named me after my father. I've said that I'm a lot like my dad, but I am also much like my mom. Though most of my life we've lived over 1000 miles from each other, I have felt closer to her than any of my other blood relatives. urlLink Favorite child, etc. : I am considered by many in my family to be my mom's favorite. I was her firstborn, and it has sometimes caused problems in my relationship with some of my other siblings, especially one of my sisters, who is only two years younger than I. urlLink Mental illness : I have answered this one before throughout this blog, but I don't mind sharing it again. In the Fall of 2000 I was diagnosed with depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, and anxiety disorder. Based on my family's medical history, I also was considered to be at risk for having a manic episode, which is part of bipolar disorder. I went to therapy and took some medicine, but I never could feel that it was working completely. At times I felt that I couldn't understand what was going on, what the illness was, etc. Then, urlLink this past January, I started seeing a different psychiatrist who concluded that I was misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder and instead showed a lot of signs for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). So I began taking some medicine to help with that. Currently, I am off the ADD medicine, and I am looking for non-medical methods of dealing with what goes on inside me. I believe that ADHD is the better diagnosis, based on what I've learned about it. I am also learning to appreciate it more. Moreover, I understand better how it relates with the other mental stuff I am dealing with.

 The 'Ooseum' My wife Jennie started her new job today as a food service worker at the University of Dayton campus. It's different in that I am still at home with my daughter Keisha, until she goes back to school next week. Today we went to the Boonshoft Discovery Museum, which my daughter calls "The Ooseum". So from 10 to 3 today I ran around with her at the museum. It was a great experience, and both of us had a great time. After we left and were driving home, I told Keisha that we did a lot today and asked her what she liked the best. She could not remember it all. I wasn't surprised. It's hard for me to remember everything we did. But I related to her some of the exhibits we saw, and I could tell that she really enjoyed the time we spent together. What makes this even more special is that it's Keisha and I spending the time together this time. Previously when I was working full time, Jennie and Keisha would do 'fun stuff' like going to the "ooseum". So, for the past five years of Keisha's life, she and Jennie have gotten very close because of all the time they spent together. I like the current situation in that Keisha and I are now growing much closer. She is, after all, in my own unbiased opinion, an awesome kid!

 You are 22% geek OK, so maybe you ain't a geek. You do, at least, show a bit of interest in the world around you.

 I received this via email a long time ago. - DAJ The intent of this song is that it's GOD who's saying the words. I hope this can encourage brothers and sisters who need to be reminded that God is always behind us, believing in us, not pointing the finger ready to zap us. I Believe In You (C) 1993 Eric Smith I was with you, from the very start I was close to you, you near to me, always in my heart So many times I counted, your troubles my very own -- I shared your tears; did you realize, you never were alone Did you hear my voice, when I called? How I long to hear your laughter And spend the days with you -- Now and forever after -- hear my voice, hear it true... I Believe In You Time ever fleeting, we watched the years pass You always hoping for one better than the last How I longed for you to call me, how I've wanted you so near And I waited so patiently, as you gave into your fears Do you hear my voice, when I call? How long to see your spirit soar And spend the days with you - Now and forever more -- hear my voice, hear it true... I Still Believe In You And then by no mistake, well that day it finally came Like cool refreshing water, I heard you calling on my name And then it seemed like only moments, that we'd ever been apart Now laughing just like children, and dreaming with one heart! Well you heard my voice when I called It's so good to hear your laughter And spend the days with you -- Now and forever after -- hear my voice, hear it true -- I Believe In You -- yeah, hear my voice, hear it true -- I've Always Believed -- In -- You.

 "Water Meter Man!" We just had a visit from Water-Meter Man! The entire visit lasted a maximum of 30 seconds, but my life is forever changed!!! Seriously, though, I've often wondered what these guys are thinking as they go inside peoples' houses. My daughter, still in her night clothes, answered the door, but fortunately, did not open it. Our 5-month old puppy has a coniption fit ("good boy!"). My lovely wife and partner, who is faithfully doing laundry, reminded me that the light above our water meter is out. So I came upstairs from blogging, and let Water-Meter Man in, amid the loudness of "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat" (my hearing-impaired daughter does not have her hearing aids in). I, bearing flashlight/radio/emergency siren/weather radio, let Water-Meter Man inside (I said that already), explaining to him that our light downstairs where the meter is doesn't work. So I lead him downstairs, shine the light, he glances at the meter, enters something into his "magical gadget", and heads back upstairs and out the door. All this in less than one minute. "Have a nice day," I said, as he left our castle. I quickly locked our door. Afterward, I encouraged our daughter for coming to get us after opening the door to reveal "Water-Meter Man", and I taught her to come get us whenever someone else comes to our door. And "normal" life resumed. And that's all I have to say about that.

 A Trip To Our Past I forgot to mention that last week, Jennie and I had to travel to Cincinnati to get copies of our birth certificates. We got there just in time to get them that day. As a part-time genealogy buff, it was a good thing. At $12 per copy, that wasn't so bad. Perhaps I'll get our relatives' birth certificates sometime in the future.

 A Few Of My Favorite Things urlLink Erin asks , "What are your favorite things from past decades--a TV show, clothing trend, style of music, etc.? (i.e. rollerskates/four wheelers, Transformers, bell bottoms)" Somewhere I have a die-cast miniature Millennium Falcon, which I got as a Christmas gift when I was younger. I know that it probably is a collector's item, but I'd need to find it first. I also had an almost-complete set of "Empire Strikes Back" story cards. I remember the anger I felt at the kid down the street, who wouldn't trade me the card I needed for a duplicate one that I had. I keep a lot of my original writing, which I wrote back in high school and college. Once I found my "voice", so to speak (no pun intended), I found that I really enjoy writing. I used to have several LPs: Cheap Trick, KISS, and others. When I moved out on my own, however, I gave those to my Dad, who has a huge record collection and the record player.

 The Moral of This Story courtesy of DB via email "Thursday night me and my youngest daughter stevie made a cake and i told her we would frost it the next day. well friday was a busy day so i again told her we would try to frost it on saturday (it was covered up to stay fresh) well saturday morning i was having a really hard day emotionally. so i was in my room crying and she comes in there and i told her i was having a hard day and she said very firmly "mom are we going to frost my cake" and i tried to explain to her again that i needed a time out and we would frost the cake later again she said "mom, i want to frost my cake" So the moral of the story is: If you think that your life is bad remember that there might be a child out there that needs a cake frosted. I hope you enjoy this story."

 urlLink The Topics Blog! I have somehow convinced Erin and Lauren that I could contribute to the urlLink Topics Blog . So, in the meantime, if you have Bloggers' block, then urlLink here's an idea . Of course, you may prefer to urlLink blog on this topic . You could also urlLink expand on this thought . If none of these suit your fancy, then you could find a number of other ideas at the urlLink Topics Blog . Check it out and let me know what you think! Update : urlLink It's official! My bio is on their contributors' page.

 Create Your Own Family Film Festival! Why not? This idea is especially good for when the weather is incredibly awful (too hot, too cold, too wet, whatever). With our growing collection, and our insatiable habit of checking out videos from the library (or is it paying the late fees?), this should be easy. Now all we have to do is figure out how to fix our VCR... urlLink Check it out...

 What good is a blood donor? Yesterday I had the privilege to hear a representative from our Community Blood Center here in Dayton, Ohio. She handed out a flyer with the following text on it: A blood donor is good for people who go through windshields and red lights. For Someone with cancer, hemophilia, or anemia. Or hepatitis. Or ulcers. For people being operated on. For people into feudin' and fightin'. For people who are almost out of life because they are almost out of blood. For a little girl who doesn't know that leukemia has happened to her. Or why. For a little boy who needs something revved up that wound down. Like energy. For people having open-heart surgery. For people who need a blood donor and also an organ donor -- a part as well as a pint -- a new heart or new liver, a lung or a kidney. For new babies needing new blood. Or new mothers needing a transfusion. For little kids who get into something poison or fall onto something sharp. For people who fool around with something that explodes, goes off, bites or shatters. For people burned pretty bad. For daredevils. Tree climbers. For people at the wrong place at the wrong time. A blood donor is good for people who are in a lot worse shape than most people you know. Someone needs a lot of your blood a lot. ---------- What are your reasons for not being a regular blood donor? I will be eligible to donate again the first or second week in October.
