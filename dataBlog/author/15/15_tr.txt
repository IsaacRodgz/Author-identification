 Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one so that when we finally meet the right person, we will know how to be grateful for that gift. When the door of happiness closes, another opens, but often times we look so long at the closed door that we don't see the one which has been opened for us. The best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a porch and swing with, never say a word, and then walk away feeling like it was the best conversation you've ever had. It's true that we don't know what we've got until we lose it, but it's also true that we don't know what we've been missing until it arrives. Giving someone all your love is never an assurance that they'll love you back! Don't expect love in return; just wait for it to grow in their heart but if it doesn't, be content it grew in yours. It takes only a minute to get a crush on someone, an hour to like someone, and a day to love someone, but it takes a lifetime to forget someone. Don't go for looks; they can deceive. Don't go for wealth; even that fades away. Go for someone who makes you smile because it takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright. Find the one that makes your heart smile There are moments in life when you miss someone so much that you just want to pick them from your dreams and hug them for real! Dream what you want to dream; go where you want to go; be what you want to be, because you have only one life and one chance to do all the things you want to do. May you have enough happiness to make you sweet, enough trials to make you strong, enough sorrow to keep you human, enough hope to make you happy. Always put yourself in others' shoes. If you feel that it hurts you, it probably hurts the other person, too. The happiest of people don't necessarily have the best of everything; they just make the most of everything that comes along their way. Happiness lives for those who cry, those who hurt, those who have searched, and those who have tried, for only they can appreciate the importance of people who have touched their lives. Love begins with a smile, grows with a kiss and ends with a tear. The brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past, you can't go on well in life until you let go of your past failures and heartaches. When you were born, you were crying and everyone around you was smiling. Live your life so that when you die, you're the one who is smiling and everyone around you is crying.

 lyon actually wanted to take photo of the flower but i actually wanted to avoid appearing in the photo BUT it turn out to be... WAN FLOWER???

 This is a true story that happened in Japan. In order to renovate the house, someone in Japan tear open the wall. Japanese houses normally have a hollow space between the wooden walls. When tearing down the walls, he found that there is a lizard stuck there because a nail from outside got stuck into one of its feet. He sees this, feels pity and at the same time curious, as when he check the nail, it was nailed 10 years ago when the house was first built. What happened? The lizard has survived in such position for 10 years! In a dark wall partition for 10 years without moving, it is not an easy task. Then he remembered, how this lizard survived for 10 years without moving a single step - the feet was nailed! So he stop the work and observe the lizard, what is it eating? Later, don't know from where appears another lizard, with food in its mouth... AHHH! He is stunted. What kind of love is this? For the lizard that was stuck by a nail, another lizard has been feeding it for the past 10 years.. And stop wondering the relationship between them: family, friends, lovers, brothers, sisters...... As the technology advances, our access to information became faster and faster. But the distance between the human beings, is it getting closer as well? NEVER ABANDON YOU LOVED ONES.

 Jurgen Vries ft. CMC - The Opera Song I have a vision That no one can imagine I can see things That no one sees I have the wisdom Knowledge of the future I'll take you to the end of time With me Deep down inside me Way beyond the silence I can hear things that no one hears Questions unanswered Better left unspoken I'll take you to the very end With me And it's a brave new world That we live in As we lose ourselves Tonight We have no control Of our feelings As we journey to the corners Of our mind

 CLOSE TO YOU - Carpenters Why do birds suddenly appear Every time you are near? Just like me, they long to be Close to you. Why do stars fall down from the sky Every time you walk by? Just like me, they long to be Close to you. On the day that you were born The angels got together And decided to create a dream come true So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold And starlight in your eyes of blue. That is why all the girls in town Follow you all around. Just like me, they long to be Close to you. On the day that you were born The angels got together And decided to create a dream come true So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold And starlight in your eyes of blue.

 "2 less lonely people in the world" by air supply a song which i immediately fall in love with while walkin past a pub on 22nd March wif u... the lyrics is really meaningful, totally fit into the mood... my dear, specially 4 u!! I was down my dreams were wearing thin When you're lost where do you begin My heart always seemed to drift from day to day Looking for the love that never came my way Then you smiled and I reached out to you I could tell you were lonely too One look and then it all began for you and me The moment that we touched I knew that there would be CHORUS Two less lonely people in the world And it's gonna be fine Out of all the people in the world I just can't believe you're mine In my life where everything was wrong Something finally went right Now there's two less lonely people In the world tonight Just to think what I might have missed Looking back how did I exist I dreamed, still I never thought I'd come this far But miracles come true, I know 'cause here we are CHORUS Tonight I fell in love with you And all the things I never knew Seemed to come to me somehow Baby, love is here and now there's CHORUS ~"~"~"~"~"~"~"~"~"~"~"~"~"~"~"~ 22nd March '03 my/her/our special day!!!

 One day a farmer's donkey fell down into a well. The animal cried piteously for hours as the farmer tried to figure out what to do. Finally he decided the animal was old, and the well needed to be covered up anyway. It wasn't worth it to retrieve the donkey. He invited all of his neighbors to come over and help him. They each grabbed a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well. At first, the donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly. Then, to everyone's amazement, he quieted down. A few shovel load later, the farmer looked down into the well, and was astonished at what he saw. As every shovel of dirt hit his back, the donkey did something amazing. He would shake it off and take a step up. As the farmer's neighbors continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and take a step up. Pretty soon, everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and trotted off. The Moral: Life is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of dirt. The trick to getting out of the well is to shake it off and take a step up. Each of our troubles is a stepping stone. We can get out of the deepest wells just by not stopping, never giving up! Shake it off and take a step up! Remember the five simple rules to be happy: Free your heart from hatred. Free your mind from worries. Live simply. Give more. Expect less. OK that's enough of that crap..... The donkey later came back, caught the farmer out in the field and kicked the crap out of him. Then he went over to each of the farmer's neighbors and kicked the crap out of them too for helping. The REAL moral: When you try to cover your ass, it always comes back to get you!

 Saying I love you Is not the words I want to hear from you It's not that I want you Not to say, but if you only knew How easy it would be to show me how you feel more than words is all you have to do to make it real Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me Cos I'd already know What would you do if my heart was torn in two more than words to show you feel That your love for me is real What would you say if I took those words away Then you couldn't make things new Just by saying I love you more than words Now I've tried to talk to you and make you understand All you have to do is close your eyes And just reach out your hands and touch me Hold me close don't ever let me go more than words is all I ever needed you to show Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me Cos I'd already know What would you do if my heart was torn in two more than words to show you feel That your love for me is real What would you say if I took those words away Then you couldn't make things new Just by saying I love you more than words come across these lyrics (ermm..i suppose they r...) that's quite touchy n meaningful

 something meaningful to share CREATING PERFECT RELATIONSHIPS? A person visited the government matchmaker for marriage, SDU, and requested, "I am looking for a spouse. Please help me to find a suitable one." The SDU officer said, "Your requirements, please." "Oh, good looking, polite, humorous, sporty, knowledgeable, good in singing and dancing. Willing to accompany me the whole day at home during my leisure hour, if I don't go out. Telling me interesting stories when I need companion for conversation and be silent when I want to rest." The officer listened carefully and replied, "I understand. You really need television." There is a saying that a perfect match can only be found between a blind wife and a deaf husband, because the blind wife cannot see the faults of the husband and the deaf husband cannot hear the nagging of the wife. Many couples are blind and deaf at the courting stage and dream of perpetual perfect relationship. Unfortunately, when the excitement of love wears off, they wake up and discover that marriage is not a bed of roses. The nightmare begins. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- NO POINTING FINGERS A man asked his father-in-law, "Many people praised you for a successful marriage. Could you please share with me your secret?" The father-in-law answered in a smile, "Never criticize your wife for her shortcomings or when she does something wrong. Always bear in mind that because of her shortcomings and weaknesses, she could not find a better husband than you." We all look forward to being loved and respected. Many people are afraid of losing face. Generally, when a person makes a mistake, he would look around to find a scapegoat to point the finger at. This is the start of a war. We should always remember that when we point one finger at a person, the other four fingers are pointing at ourselves. If we forgive others, others will ignore our mistake too. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- NO OVERPOWERING Many relationships fail because one party tries to overpower another, or demands too much. People in love tend to think that love will conquer all and their spouses will change the bad habits after marriage. Actually, this is not the case. There is a Chinese saying which carries the meaning that "It is easier to reshape a mountain or a river than a person's character." It is not easy to change. Thus, having high expectation on changing the spouse character will cause disappointment and unpleasantness. It would be less painful to change ourselves and lower our expectations. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- RIGHT SPEECH There is a Chinese saying which carries the meaning that "A speech will either prosper or ruin a nation." Many relationships break off because of wrong speech. When a couple is too close with each other, we always forget mutual respect and courtesy. We may say anything without considering if it would hurt the other party. A friend and her millionaire husband visited their construction site. A worker who wore a helmet saw her and shouted, "Hi, Emily! Remember me? We used to date in the secondary school." On the way home, her millionaire husband teased her, "Luckily you married me. Otherwise you will be the wife of a construction worker." She answered, "You should appreciate that you married me. Otherwise, he will be the millionaire and not you." Frequently exchanging these remarks plants the seed for a bad relationship. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- TRUST Trust is a very important factor for all relationships. When trust is broken, it is the end of the relationship. Lack of trust leads to suspicion, suspicion generates anger, anger causes enmity and enmity may result in separation. A telephone operator told me that one day she received a phone call. She answered, "Public Utilities Board." There was silence. She repeated, "PUB." There was still no answer. When she was going to cut off the line, she heard a lady's voice, "Oh, so this is PUB. Sorry, I got the number from my husband's pocket but I do not know whose number it is." Without mutual trust, just imagine what will happen to the couple if the telephone operator answered with just "hello" instead of"PUB". ------------------------------------------------------------------------- PERSONAL PERCEPTION Different people have different perception. One man's meat could be another man's poison. A couple bought a donkey from the market. On the way home, a boy commented, "Very stupid. Why neither of them rides on the donkey?" Upon hearing that, the husband let the wife ride on the donkey. He walked besides them. Later, an old man saw it and commented, "The husband is the head of family. How can the wife ride on the donkey while the husband is on foot?" Hearing this, the wife quickly got down and let the husband ride on the donkey. Further on the way home, they met an old Lady. She commented, "How can the man ride on the donkey but let the wife walk. He is no gentleman." The husband thus quickly asked the wife to join him on the donkey. Then, they met a young man. He commented, "Poor donkey, how can you hold up the weight of two persons. They are cruel to you." Hearing that, the husband and wife immediately climbed down from the donkey and carried it on their shoulders. It seems to be the only choice left. Later, on a narrow bridge, the donkey was frightened and struggled. They lost their balance and fell into the river. You can never have everyone praise you, nor will everyone condemn you. Never in the past, not at present, and never will be in the future. Thus, do not be too bothered by others words if our conscience is clear.

 A group of Geography students studied the Seven Wonders of the World. At the end of that section, the students were asked to list what they considered to be the Seven Wonders of the World. Though there was some disagreement, the following got the most votes: 1. Egypt's Great Pyramids 2. Taj Mahal 3. Grand Canyon 4. Panama Canal 5. Empire State Building 6. St. Peter's Basilica 7. China's Great Wall While gathering the votes, the teacher noted that one student, a quiet girl, hadn't turned in her paper yet. So she asked the girl if she was having trouble with her list. The quiet girl replied, "Yes, a little. I couldn't quite make up my mind because there were so many." The teacher said, "Well, tell us what you have, and maybe we can help." The girl hesitated, then read, "I think the Seven Wonders of the World are: 1. to touch 2. to taste 3. to see 4. to hear She hesitated a little, and then, 5. to run 6. to laugh 7. and to love It is far too easy for us to look at the exploits of man and refer to them as "wonders" while we overlook all God has done, regarding them as merely "ordinary." May you be reminded today of those things which are truly wondrous.

 You're as beautiful as you think you are I THINK, therefore I am. And if I think I'm gorgeous and more stunning than Cameron Diaz, then I'll act that way. And if I think I'm a loser who looks like a horse, I'll act like one, too. It's all in the mind, said Mr David Kan, Executive Director of the Family Life Centre. He believes our "thought life" has a tendency to reflect itself in our real life, so we have to nourish the power of the mind and be empowered by positive thoughts. For some of us, the reservoirs of our lives are running dry. "Running on empty" is not just a catch phrase, it's the reality of their everyday lives. When we are feeling down, it's hard to look up or imagine that things could get better. Yet, it's precisely this attitude that we need to cultivate - the belief that things are going to get better. If we don't do that, we are simply going to sink further into depression. Think about it - if you have negative thoughts all the time, isn't your state of mind going to affect your attitude and actions? Your life's reservoir would be drained by your self-defeatist mentality in a jiffy. Many factors affect whether your mindset is positive or negative. External factors can include simple things like being appreciated for your performance at the office, getting a promotion, or even perhaps resolving a misunderstanding. Internal factors are the mental disciplines of life. They are simple (but not always easy to do) things like believing you are here for a purpose and that you can contribute to the environment and people around you. Positive belief is the first step to housekeeping your mind. When we have a positive mindset, we find it easier to like and trust people. Life is easier if you are genuinely able to do that. - Skye Tan extracted from the Newpaper, find it true so would like to share with all of you. [copied from namida tot's pg] find it quite meaningful...

 [something from my email] WHY ?? After spending time with Eve, Adam was walking in the Garden with God. Adam told God how much the woman means to him and how blessed he feels to have her. Adam began to ask questions about her. Adam: Lord, Eve is beautiful. Why did you make her so beautiful? God: So you will always want to look at her. Adam: Lord, her skin is so soft. Why did you make her skin so soft? God: So you will always want to touch her. Adam: She always smells so good. Lord, why did you make her smell so good? God: So you will always want to be near her. Adam: That's wonderful Lord, and I don't want to seem ungrateful, but why did you make her so stupid? God: So she would love you.

 [something from my email] 15 Things You Probably Never Knew or Thought About 1. At least 5 people in this world love you so much they would die for you. 2. At least 15 people in this world love you in some way. 3. The only reason anyone would ever hate you is because they want to be just like you. 4. A smile from you can bring happiness to anyone, even if they don't like you. 5. Every night, SOMEONE thinks about you before they go to sleep. 6. You mean the world to someone. 7. If not for you, someone may not be living. 8. You are special and unique. 9. Someone that you don't even know exists loves you. 10. When you make the biggest mistake ever, something good comes from it. 11. When you think the world has turned its back on you, take a look: you most likely turned your back on the world. 12. When you think you have no chance of getting what you want, you probably won't get it, but if you believe in yourself, probably, sooner or later, you will get it. 13. Always remember the compliments you received. Forget about the rude remarks. 14. Always tell someone how you feel about them; you will feel much better when they know. 15. If you have a great friend, take the time to let them know that they are great. A Minute They say it takes a minute to find a special person, an hour to appreciate them, a day to love them, but then an entire life to forget them.

 From EMAIL: Try it out and the battery shop will close soon. If the life of your mobile phone's battery is shortening due to "memory effect" / aging, would you go an buy a new battery to replace it? Next time when you encounter this situation, try saving your money. Can try and see: 1. Wrap the battery up with newspapers, put it into a plastic bag and then into the freezer for 3 days (the newspapers will absorb the accessive moisture). 2. After 3 days, take out the battery and leave it in normal temperature for 2 days. 3. After 2 days, fully charge up the battery and put it into your mobile phone and see (this is estimated to be able to salvage about 80%-90%) This information was provided by an engineer in a well-known battery factory.

 urlLink IQ

 from email BEWARE LADIES................... DETECTING A 2-WAY MIRROR How to determine if a mirror are 2 way or not ( Serious ) Not to scare you, but to make sure that you are aware. This was passed on by a police-woman who gives seminars and techniques for house wives, Businesswomen, executives. Many of the hotels cheat the customers this way & enjoy while the Couples enjoy their honeymoon in their rooms. When we visit toilets, bathrooms, hotel rooms, changing rooms, etc, how many of you know for sure that the seemingly ordinary mirror hanging on the wall is a real mirror, or actually a 2-way mirror i.e., they can see you, but you can't see them ? There have been many cases of people installing 2-way mirrors in female changing rooms or bathrooms or bedrooms. It is very difficult to positively identify the surface by just looking at it. So, how do we determine with any amount of certainty what type of mirror we are looking at ? CONDUCT THIS SIMPLE TEST: Place the tip of your fingernail against the reflective surface and if there is a GAP between your fingernail and the image of the nail, then it is a GENUINE mirror. However, if your fingernail DIRECTLY TOUCHES the image of your nail, then BEWARE, IT IS A 2-WAY MIRROR! (Someone seeing you from the other side). So remember, every time you see a mirror, do the "fingernail test". It doesn't cost you anything. It is simple to do. This is a really good thing to do. The reason there is a gap on a real mirror, is because silver is on the back of the mirror UNDER the glass. Whereas with a 2-way mirror, the silver is on the surface. Keep it in mind! Make sure and check every time you enter in hotel rooms. May be someone is making a film on you. Ladies: Share this with your friends.

 urlLink What's Your One Piece Doujinshi Personality? brought to you by urlLink Quizilla Analysis: You tend to keep things simple. Food, friends, and fun, the best things in life, are always what you seek. The line between right and wrong is very clear for you and you are quick to point out when a person has wronged another. Your sense of justice is strong and therefore you need to be with people who you can respect as "good people". You can't be bothered to have a relationship with someone you can't look up to. This is awesome. You are friendly to everyone, and open, but you choose your companions very carefully, and once you have chosen them, you give your heart to them. Friendship and love are one and the same to you, inseperable feelings you naturally have for one whom you have admitted into your trust. You don't wait for loved ones to extend shows of devotion to you, you are the one who demonstrates time and again, that you will be there for them. But because of your simple nature, you're not one to burden them with love confessions and such. You will wait until they do so first, and then you'll let out the love that you've had for them all along. A caution: As doujinshi Luffy, you may exhibit outbursts or strange behavior, including but not limited to, spontaneous hugging or kissing of your companions, fits of childish possessiveness, sudden girlishness, blushing, innuendos having to do with eating or references to rubber, pouting and petulance, and overly innocent ways pertaining to bathing and sleeping which may lead to the development of Rorikon in Zoro-types and/or Shanks-types if gone unchecked. Please use caution and stick close to a Nami-type and out of the water. Thank you. You are most compatible with: A Zoro-type also takes love very seriously and would compliment your easygoing nature well. A Nami-type could really use having a person like you in their life as well, and will find your attitude and beliefs refreshing. Advice: Take a little vacation with someone you love. And give more hugs, your hugs are great.

 The Chicken and Horse There was a chicken and a horse playing together in a barn yard, when suddenly the horse falls into a pit. He yells to the chicken, "Go get the farmer, save me,save me!!!". The chicken goes looking for the farmer but can't find him. So she gets the farmer's Mercedes and drives it over to the mud pit, lassoes the horse, ties it to the car and pulls him out. The horse says, "Thank you, Thank you, I owe you my life." Then a couple days later they are playing there again and this time the chicken falls into the mud pit and the chicken says, "Help me!!! Help me!!! Go get the farmer!!!". So the horse says, "No No No, I think I can get you." The horse stretches across the mud pit and tells the chicken, "Grab onto my penis!" The chicken grabs on, the horse stretches back, and the horse saves the chicken's life. So what's the moral of the story ??? "If you have a penis the size of a horse, you don't need a Mercedes to pick up chicks"

 Food for Thot A wealthy man decided to go on a safari in Africa. He took his faithful pet Chihuahua along for company. One day, the Chihuahua starts chasing butterflies and before long the Chihuahua discovers that he is lost. So, wandering about, he notices a leopard heading rapidly in his direction with the obvious intention of having lunch. The Chihuahua thinks, "OK, I'm in deep trouble now! Then he noticed some bones on the ground close by, and immediately settles down to chew on the bones with his back to the approaching cat. Just as the leopard is about to leap, the Chihuahua exclaims loudly, "Boy, that was one delicious leopard, I wonder if there are any more around here?" Hearing this, the leopard halts his attack in mid-stride, as a look of terror comes over him, and slinks away into the trees. "Whew," says the leopard. "That was close. That Chihuahua nearly had me." Meanwhile, a monkey who had been watching the whole scene from a nearby tree figures he can put this knowledge to good use and trade it for protection from the leopard. So, off he goes. But the Chihuahua saw him heading after the leopard with great speed, and figured that something must be up. The monkey soon catches up with the leopard, spills the beans and strikes a deal for himself with the leopard. The leopard is furious at being made a fool of and says, "Here monkey, hop on my back and see what's going to happen to that conniving canine." Now the Chihuahua sees the leopard coming with the monkey on his back, and thinks, "What am I going to do now?" But instead of running, the dog sits down with his back to his attackers, pretending he hasn't seen them yet... And just when they get close enough to hear the Chihuahua says, "Where's that damn stupid monkey? I sent him off half an hour ago to bring me another leopard, and why hasn't he come back yet..." Moral of the story? 1. Don't do "backbiting", or "backstabbing". It could "backfire" at you! 2. Never, never, never give up. 3. In the midst of your trouble, do your best to remain calm and think of a solution rather than panicking, and... 4. Sometimes if you can't dazzle them with your efforts and brilliance, then baffle them with bullshit!!

 LAME ... but nothing else betta to do.. heh Things You Would Never Know Without Chinese Swordsman Movies Being the hero's parents will always be unlucky and will usually be killed by enemies when the hero is young, and the hero will become an orphan. When a man is wounded and dying, he always manage to catch his breath and speak a few sentences to reveal the killer before dropping his head and declare dead. When an old man is dying after being attacked by villains, while lying down he will ask the hero (kneeling beside him) to take care of his beautiful daughter (who will be crying). When fighting with the enemy, instead of hitting each other, the villain and the hero will choose to hit each other's palm and stone there for sometime before pushing each other away... and one of them will spill blood out of his mouth. Skilled people are able to fly over rooftops, up trees and across distances without any sweat. But when travelling to towns and villages, they still have to walk or ride horses. When saying goodbye to other skilled fighters, they will cover their right fist with their left palm and jumping out of camera screen (assuming you know they actually fly off into the sky). The heroes need not have to work for money, but will always have golds and silvers with them to pay for their dishes. The inn is such an up-to-date information-centre that when having lunch at the inn, you can always overhear gossips of latest news on what's happening in the pugilistic-world. And usually the gossips come from a few goons at the next table. Assassins seem to have some kind of agency for employments --they always wear the same standard uniform, black cloth all over revealing only the eyes. The heroes and villains will meet each other very often no matter how big the country is and no matter where they are. It's easy to immobilize someone - just touch someone with your fore finger and middle finger anywhere on his body and he will not move... but he still can curse and swear. To cure an immobilization, just anyhow tap your fingers all over his body again. Healing internal wounds in the body is as easy as sitting down cross-legged, palms on the knees and smoke coming out from the head. People like to pass short messages on paper with flying darts to show off their darting skills. When committing suicide, people are so lazy that they choose to hit the forehead with their own palm. The villains have some kind of strange habit that they like to stay in a secret underground compartment just behind the walls of their room, usually opened up by turning a small statue. When chasing someone, people tend to shout at the runner and order him to stop...as if he will obey. Nobel's invention of explosives in 1866 is in fact useless. Highly skilled people in the pugilistic world during ancient times already know how to cause explosions with bare hands. Highly skilled villains have the power to destroy rocks, but do not have the power to kill the hero. Two highly skilled persons are so nervous in their duel that they keep talking and criticizing each other before they actually start the fight. People in the pugilistic world are so free that they don't have to work. They attend gatherings, meetings everytime and nose around other people's matter.

 cos it was friday?!?...

 ...

 something meaningful i've read: Everything in life has a bright and a dark side, so.. life is never black or white... it is grey. And I'll keep insisting on that. Of course that when we're in a cage, when everything seems wrong and sucky and we feel that there's no more reason to life, it's exactly the opposite. Those are the times we are at the bottom of the pool... there's no place else to go but up, u know? We are already at the bottom, now all we need is impulse that our feet are going to create when they reach the pool's floor and propel us up to the surface again. It's all that we need, so we have to pay attention to that. It's exactly when hope seems to fail that something makes us come back with full energy. We shouldn't give in to sadness, anger and bad feelings... we shouldn't blame anything or anyone for our sucky lives. We are responsible for our lives. When WE want to get out of the shit, we do. But it's very difficult since society has led us to believe we can't really do anything more than just follow their fuckin' rules and be cattle just life most of the people in the world. That's why taking the blue pill seems better than taking the red one. But, sincerely, I don't think so. It's all about Plato and his theories... it all comes back to him. So, going against all this makes us very tired and unhappy... unsatisfied... depressed, helpless... sick. But "everything's not lost"... everything has a way out. There's always a light at the end of the tunnel. Don't panic, don't get desperate. It's worse. Instead, calm down, look around, see the bright points, analyse... you'll see that there are a lot of good things you're leaving behind or taking for granted just for the sake of enphasizing the bad aspects of your life. When we start to value the simplest and purest things of our life (even when they seem only a few), we start to feel better about ourselves and the world. And no one can really affect us, even if they try. Don't give in to madness and fear and your weaknesses and weak people who want you to join them in their death. Follow the white rabbit. Free yourself from them. Destroy the matrix!!

 Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous or boastful or proud or rude. Love does not demand its own way. Love is not irritable, and it keeps no record of when it has been wronged. It is never glad about injustice but rejoices whenever the truth wins out. Love never gives up, never loses faith, is always hopeful, and endures through every circumstance. Love will last forever.

 A guy was playing golf one day and he got lost. He saw a lady up ahead of him and went to her and said,"Can you please help me, I don't know what hole I'm on." She told him "You are one hole behind me. I'm on 7; you're on 6." He thanked her and continued playing golf. Later he got lost again. He saw the same lady and went to her again kind of embarrassed. "I'm sorry to bother you again but I'm lost again, can you please tell me what hole I'm on." She told him "you are one hole behind me. I'm on 14; you are on13." Again he thanked her and continued playing golf. When he finished he saw her in the clubhouse. He went up to her and asked if he could buy her a drink for helping him out. She accepted. As they were drinking and talking he asked her what she did for a living. "I'm in sales." He replied, "no kidding so am I. What do you sell?" She said it's too embarrassing to tell. But after he kept pleading to know what she sold she said she'd tell him if he promised not to laugh. He promised. She said, "I sell WHISPER (Sanitary Napkins)" . He immediately fell to the floor laughing hysterically. She said, "You promised you wouldn't laugh". He replied, "I'm sorry, but I couldn't help it. I sell toilet paper........ I'm still one hole behind you."

 read it in someone's blog while blog-surfing... meaningful Everyone is precious in the eye of someone. Most importantly is to find that someone who appreciate you as who you are. There are a lot of stars in the sky. Not everyone of them shines as brightly as the others. But don't just look at the brightest. There are some that are not so bright, but that is because you have not found the gems in them. Some takes time to be discovered, some only emerge upon deeper interaction. When you find the correct one, they will becomes the brighest stars in the sky. And they shine just for you. They becomes special as well, just like the moon. Have you found your star? If not, they will eventually come to you. Take time to look around you... If you have, make sure you are worth it. Make sure you treasure what you have now. Make sure you make yourself special. Make sure you appreciate your partner. 'There is only one moon in the sky but stars are plentiful '...

You can be somewhat of a loner, but just as easily you could be the leader of many. You tend to be negative, and hard to relate to, but you give off a relaxed image despite being insecure - and secretly many people long to be like you, not knowing how deep the Winter season really is. Well done... You're the most inspirational of seasons :) urlLink ?? Which Season Are You ?? brought to you by urlLink Quizilla i should b a mixture of autumn n winter You're warm, and the most approachable. You have that gentle prescence about you. People can relate to you, and find you easy company. However it's likely you've been hurt in the past and it has left you scarred so things can become rather chilly with you at times. Being the third Season in, you're mature, trustworthy and loyal to your friends but prone to depression and negative thinking.

 They have been married for two years. He loves literature and often posts his work on the net, but nobody ever reads them. He is also into photography and he handle their wedding photos. He loves her very much. Likewise with her. She has a quick temperand always bullies him. He is a gentleman and always gives in to her. Today, she's being wilful again. Her : "Why can't you be the photographer for my friend's wedding? She promised she'd pay." Him : "I don't have time that day." Her :"Humph!" Him : "Huh?" Her : "Don't have time? Write less of those novels, and you will have all the time you need." Him : "I... someone will definitely recognize my work some day." Her : "Humph! I don't care, you'll have to do it for her.! " Him : "No." Her : "Just this once?" Him : "No." Negotiation's broken. So, she gave the final warning: "Give me a Yes within three days, or else..." First day. She "withheld" the kitchen, bathroom, computer,refrigerator, television, hi-fi... Except the double bed, to show her "benevolence". Of course, she has to sleep on it too. He didn't mind, as he still has some cash in his pockets. Second day. She conducted a raid and removed everything from his pockets and warned, "Seek any external help, and you bear the consequences." He's nervous now. That night, on the bed, he begs for mercy, hoping that she'll end this state. She doesn't give a damn. No way am I giving in, whatever he says. Until he agrees. Third day. Night. On the Bed. He's lying on the bed, looking to one side. She's lying on the bed, looking to the other side. Him : "We need to talk." Her : "Unless it's about the wedding, forget it." Him : "It's something very important." She remains silent. Him :"Let's get a divorce." She did not believe her ears. Him : "I got to know a girl." She's totally angry, and wanted to hit him. But she held it down, wanting to let him finish. But her eyes already felt wet. He took a photo out from his chest. Probably from his undershirt pocket, that's the only place she didn't go through yesterday. How careless. Him : "She's a nice girl." Her tears fell. Him : "She has a good personality too." She's heartbroken because he puts a photo of some other girl close to his heart. Him : "She says that she'll support me fully in my pursue for literature after we got married." She's very jealous because she said the same thing in the past. Him : "She loves me truly. " She wishes to sit up and scream at him "Don't I?" Him : "So, I think she won't force me to do something that I don't want to do." She's thinking, but the rage won't subside. Him : "Want to take a look at the photo I took for her?" Her : ".....!" He brings the photo before her eyes. She's in a total rage, hits his hand away and leaves a burning slap on his face. He sighs. She cries. He puts the photo back to his pocket. She pulls her hand back under the blanket. He turns off the light, and sleeps. She turns on the light, and sits up. He's asleep. She lost sleep. She regrets treating him the way she treated him. She cried again, and thought about a lot of things. She wants to wake him up. She wants to have a intimate talk with him. She doesn't want to push him anymore. She stares at his chest. She wants to see how the girl looks. She slips the photo out. She wanted to cry and she wanted to laugh. It's a nicely taken photo of herself. A photo he took for her. She bends down, and kissed him on his cheek. He smiled. He was just pretending to be asleep. "You learn to love, not by finding a perfect person, but by learning to see an imperfect person perfectly."

 came upon this story; translated from a korean love story *** Doll I have a boyfriend who grew up with me. His name is Jin. I always thought of him as a friend until last year, when we went to a trip from a club. I found that I fell in love with him. Before that trip was over, I took a step and confessed my love for him. And soon, we became a pair of lovers, but we loved each other in different ways. I always concentrated on him only, but by his side, there were so many other girls. To me, he was the only one, but to him, maybe I was just another girl? "Jin, do you want to go watch a movie??"I asked. "I can't" "Why? You need to study at home??" I felt disappointment grabbing me. "Going to meet a friend?" He was always like that. He met girls in front of me, like it was nothing. To him, I was just a girlfriend. The word love only came out from my mouth. Since I knew him, I had never heard him say i love you? before. To us, there weren't any anniversaries at all. He didn't say anything from the first day and it continued till 100 days.. 200days.. Everyday, before we say goodbye, he would just hand me a doll, everyday, without fail. I don't know why. Then one day... Me: Um, Jin, I ? Jin: What? don't drag, just say.. Me: I love you. Jin: erm.. just take this doll and go home. That was how he ignored my three words and handed me the doll. Then he disappeared, like he was running away. The dolls I received from him everyday, filled my room, one by one. Then one day came, my 15th year old birthday. When I got up in the morning, I pictured a party with him, and stranded myself in my room, waiting for his call. But then, lunch passed, dinner passed.. and soon the sky was dark... he still didn't call. It was already tiring to look at the phone anymore. Then around 2am in the morning, he suddenly called me and woke me from my sleep. He told me to come out of my house. Still, I felt joy and I ran out happily. Me: Jin? Jin: Here.. take this? Again, he handed me a little doll. Me: What's this? Jin: I didn't give it to you yesterday, so I am giving it to you now. I'm going home now, bye. Me: Wait, wait! Do you know what today is? Jin: Today? Huh? I felt so sad, I thought he would remember my birthday. He turned around and walked away like nothing had happen. Then I shouted. "Wait!!" Jin: You have something to say? Me: Tell me, tell me you love me? Jin: What?! Me: Tell me I put my pathetic self behind and clung on to him. But he just said simple cold words and left. "I don't want to say that I love someone so easily, if you are desperate to hear it, then find someone else. That was what he said. Then he ran off. My legs felt numb and I collapsed to the ground. He didn't want to say it easily? How could he? Maybe he is not the right guy for me... After that day, I stranded myself at home crying, just crying. He didn't call me, although I was waiting. He just continued handing me a little doll every morning outside my house. That's how those dolls piled up in my room everyday. After a month, I got myself together and went to school. But what made the pain resurface was that I saw him on a street with another girl? He had a smile on his face, one that he never showed me. I ran straight back home and looked at the dolls in my room, and tears fell. Why did he gave these to me? Those dolls are probably picked out by some other girls. In a fit of anger, I threw the dolls around. Then suddenly, the phone rang. It was him. He told me to come out to the bus stop outside my house. I tried to calm myself down and walked to the bus stop. I kept reminding myself that I am going to forget him, that it's going to end. Then he came into my sight, holding a big doll. Jin: Jo, I thought you were pissed, you really came? I couldn't help hating him, acting like nothing had happen and joking around. Soon, he held out the doll as usual? Me: I don't need it. Jin: What? why? I grabbed the doll from his hands and threw it on the road. Me: I don't need this doll, I don't need it anymore!! I don't want to see a person like you again! I spitted out all the words that were inside me. But unlike other days, his eyes was shaking. "I'm sorry." He apologized in a tiny voice. He then walked over to the road to pick up the doll. Me: You stupid! Why are you picking up the doll?! Just throw it away!!! But he ignored me and just went to pick the doll. Then... Honk~ Honk~ With a loud honk, a big truck was heading towards him. "Jin! Move! Move away!"I shouted. But he didn't hear me, he squatted down and picked up the doll. "Jin, move!" HONK~!! "Boom!"That sound, was terrifying. That's how he went away from me. That's how he went away without even opening his eyes to say one word to me. After that day, I had to go through everyday with guiltiness and the sadness of losing him. And after spending two months like a crazy person, I took out the dolls. Those were the only gifts he left me since the day we started going out. I remembered the days I spent with him and started to count the days when we were in love. One, Two, three... That was how I started to count the dolls. Four hundred and eighty four... four hundred and eighty five... It all ended with 485 dolls. I then started to cry again, with a doll in my arms. I hugged it tightly, then suddenly, " I love you~, I love you~" I dropped the dolls,shocked. i... lo..ve.. you??? I picked up the dolls and pressed its stomach. " i love you~ I love you~" It can't be! I pressed all the dolls' stomach as it piled on the side. "i love you~" "i love you~" "i love you~" Those words came out non-stop. I love you. Why didn't I realize that? That his heart was always by my side, protecting me. Why didn't I realize that he love me this much? I took out the doll under the bed and pressed its stomach, that was the last doll, the one that fell on the road. It had his blood stain on it. The voice came out, the one that I was missing so much... "Do... Do you know what today is? We've been loving each other for 486 days. Do you know what 486 is? I couldn't say I love you.. since I was too shy... If you forgive me and take this doll, I will say that I love you everyday...till I die.. Jo...I love you... The tears came flowing out of me. Why? Why? I asked god, why do I only know about all this now? He can't be by my side, but he loved me until his last minute... ***

 Imagine a clear blue sky without a cloud in sight. Just thinking about it should give your spirits a little lift. Now turn your mind's eye down to survey the landscape. Which of the following scenes feels most calming and relaxing to you? 1. A white snowy plain. 2. A blue seascape. 3. A green mountain. 4. A field of yellow flowers. [The scene you pictured contrasted against that clear blue sky reveals a hidden talent that resides in the depths of our untroubled mind. ] 1. A white snowy plain. You are blessed with a special sensitivity that allows you to comprehend situations at first glance and decipher complex problems without needing any proof or explanation. You have what it takes to be a clear-sighted decision maker and even something of a visionary. Always trust your first intuitions; they will guide you well. 2. A blue seascape. You have a natural talent for interpersonal relations. People respect your ability to communicate with others and the way you help bring diverse groups together. Just by being around, you help others work more smoothly and efficiently, making you an invaluable member of any project or team. When you say, "Nice job. Keep up the good work," people know you mean it. So it means that much more to them. 3. A green mountain. Your gift is for expressive communication. You always seem to be able to find the words to express the way you feel, and people soon realize it's exactly how they were feeling, too. They say that joy shared is multiplied, while shared grief is divided. You always seem able to help others find the right side of that equation. 4. A filed of yellow flowers. You are a storehouse of knowledge and creativity, bursting with ideas and almost infinite potential. Keep attuned to the feelings of others and never stop working on building your dreams, and there is nothing you cannot achieve.

 You are standing in front of a painting at an art museum, hands clasped behind your back as you try to take it in, when a total stranger comes up alongside you and says something to you. Which of the following does the stranger say? 1. "Isn't that a beautiful picture?" 2. "What do you think of this painting?" 3. "Excuse me, do you have the time?" 4. "You know, I happen to be a painter myself." [In this imaginary scenario, the words the stranger spoke actually reflect how you react in chance encounters and when meeting others. Your answer reveals what kind of impression you make when meeting someone for the first time. ] 1. "Isn't that a beautiful picture?" Your friendly and positive nature creates a great first impression on almost everyone you meet. Your only concern should be that people may not take you seriously at first. 2. "What do you think of this painting?" You're the type who likes to feel out the other's temperament before committing yourself to anything. People can sense that hesitancy, and it may color their reactions to you. You won't step on any toes with your cautious approach, but you may end up living on the people's terms. 3. "Excuse me, do you have the time?" To half the world you seem like an all right sort, but to the other half you look just a little strange. You create a first impression of living life at your own pace and maintaining an individuality that some would call eccentric. You don't place much importance on what others may be thinking or feeling. For better or worse, therein lies the secret to you. 4. "You know, I happen to be a painter myself." On first meeting someone, you come across as a little bit nervous and overeager. Maybe you're just trying too hard to be liked, but the harder you try, the worse impression you make. Don't worry so much about making people think you're great - they'll like you better if you just loosen up and relax.

 One day a blue bird suddenly flies through a window into your room and is trapped. Something about this lost bird attracts you, and you decide to keep it. But to your surprise, the next day the bird has changed clorfrom blue to yellow! This very special bird changes color again overnight - on the morning of the third day it is bright red, and on the fourth it turns completely black. What color is the bird when you wake up on the fifth day? 1. The bird doesn't change color; it stays black. 2. The bird turns back to its original blue. 3. The bird turns white. 4. The bird turns golden colored. [The bird that flew into your room seemed like a symbol of good fortune, but suddenly it changed color, making you worry that happiness would not last. Your reaction to this situation shows how you respond to difficulties and uncertainty in real life. ] 1. Those who said the bird stays black have a pessimistic outlook. Do you tend to believe that once a situation goes bad, it never really returns to normal? Maybe you need to try thinking, If this is as bad as it gets, it can't get any worse. Remember, there's no rain that doesn't end and no night o dark that there's no dawn the next day. 2. Those who said the bird turns blue again are practical optimists. You believe that life is a mix of good and bad and that it doesn't pay to fight against that reality. You accept adversity calmly and let things run their course without undue stress or worry. This outlook lets you ride out the waves of adversity without being swept away. 3. Those who said the bird turns white are cool and decisive under pressure. You don't waste time on fretting and indecision, even when a crisis develops. If a situation gets too bad, you feel it's better to cut your losses and look for another route to your goal rather than getting bogged down in needless grief. this proactive approach means that things seem to just naturally go your way. 4. Those who said the bird turns golden can be described as fearless. You don't know the meaning of pressure. To you, every crisis is an opportunity. You might be compared with Napoleon, who said, ". . . impossible: the word is not French." But be careful not to let your boundless confidence get the best of you. It's a very fine line between fearless and foolhardy.

 You're walking down the street, thinking of other things, when you stumble into a garbage can on the sidewalk and knock it over. What comes spilling out from under the lid? 1. Nothing comes out - the can was empty. 2. A pile of loose trash spills out onto the street. 3. Apples cores, chicken bones, and other raw garbage. 4. A well-tied black plastic garbage bag. [In your carelessness you overturned a garbage can, dumping out something that had been neatly shut away and exposing for all the world to see. Your image of the can's contents reveal things inside you that you try to hide from public view. ] 1. Nothing comes out - the can was empty. People who gave this answer tend to live their lives without making displays or false pretenses. What you see is what you get. It's this simple honesty that gives them their charm. 2. A pile of loose trash spills out onto the street. Those of you who said the can was full of loose trash may seem to be straightforward and forthright to others but actually have a pile of unexpressed feelings locked up within. You may notice these feelings only as general sense of frustration, but when you think about it, aren't there places where you've been holding back from saying the things you really feel? 3. Apples cores, chicken bones, and other raw garbage. People who imagined a pile of kitchen waste are suppressing their appetites and the natural desire for food. Maybe you're on (or just avoiding) a diet. Or trying to save money by cutting back on eating expenses. Whatever the case, it's taking its toll on you. There's no need to overdo it, but it might do you good to spend a well-earned night out at a restaurant with friends. 4. A well-tied black plastic garbage bag. People who saw a neatly tied garbage bag has a strong sense of self-control. Maybe too strong. You hate to show weakness or make complaints - your pride won't allow it. But letting others know how you really feel is no sign of weakness. Loosen up the drawstrings and let in some air before all that garbage goes bad and starts to smell.

 urlLink Are you the scientific or artistic brain? You're dominated by your right brain, which makes you the artist. The degree in which you're dominated by the artistic brain depends on your score. The higher your score is, the more dominate this side of the brain is. Not only are you highly creative, but you're also very emotional with a tendency toward sadness and despair.

 TAKE ME TO STATE OF TRANCE TO LIVE LIFE ANOTHER CHANCE

 From the very beginning, girl's family objected strongly on her dating this guy, saying that it has got to do with family background, & that the girl will have to suffer for the rest of her life if she were to be with him. Due to family's pressure, the couple quarrelled very often. Though the girl loved the guy deeply, she always asked him: "How deep is your love for me?" As the guy is not good with his words, this often caused the girl to be very upset. With that & the family's pressure, the gal often vent her anger on him. As for him,.. he only endured it in silence. After a couple of years, the guy finally graduated & decided to further his studies overseas. Before leaving, he proposed to the gal: "I'm not very good with words. But all I know is that I love you. If you allow me, I will take care of you for the rest of my life. As for your family, I'll try my best to talk them round. Will you marry me?" The girl agreed, & with the guy's determination, the family finally gave in & agreed to let them get married. So before he left, they got engaged. The gal went out to the working society, whereas the guy was overseas, continuing his studies. They sent their love through emails & phone calls. Though it was hard, but both never thought of giving up. One day, while the gal was on her way to work, she was knocked down by a car that lost control. when she woke up, she saw her parents beside her bed. She realized that she was badly injured. Seeing her mum crying, she wanted to comfort her. But she realized that all that could come out of her mouth was just a sigh. she had lost her voice.... The doctors says that the impact on her brain has caused her to lose her voice. Listening to her parents' comfort, but with nothing coming out from her, she broke down. During the stay in hospital, besides silence cry,.. it's still just silence cry that accompanied her. Upon reaching home, everything seems to be the same. Except for the ringing tone of the phone. Which pierced into her heart everytime it rang. She does not wish to let the guy know. & not wanting to be a burden to him, she wrote a letter to him saying that she does not wish to wait any longer. With that, she sent the ring back to him. In return, the guy sent millions & millions of reply, countless of phonecalls,.. all the gal could do, besides crying, is still crying.... The parents decided to move away, hoping that she could eventually forget everything & be happy. With a new environment, the gal learn sign language & started a new life. Telling herself everyday that she must forget the guy. One day, her friend came & told her that he's back. She asked her friend not to let him know what happened to her. Since then, there wasn't anymore news of him. A year has passed & her friend came with an envelope, containing a invitation card for the guy's wedding. the gal was shattered. When she open the letter, she saw her name in it instead. When she was about to ask her friend what's going on, she saw the guy standing in front of her. He used sign language to tell her "I've spent a year to learn sign language. Just to let you know that I've not forgotten our promise. Let me have the chance to be your voice. I Love You." With that, he slipped the ring back into her finger. The gal finally smiled.

 A radio station in Australia recently ran a phone-in competition to find the most embarrassing moments in listeners lives. The following are the Final four place getters: 4th place "While in line at the bank one afternoon, my toddler decided to release some pent-up energy & started to run amuck. I was finally able to grab hold of her after receiving looks of disgust & annoyance from other patrons. I told her that if she didn't start behaving herself right now, she would be punished. To my horror, she looked me in the eye & said in a voice just as threatening, "If you don't let me go right now, I will tell Grandma that I saw you kissing Daddy's pee-pee last night!". The silence was deafening, after this enlightening exchange. Even the tellers stopped what they were doing! I mustered the last of my dignity & walked out of the bank with my daughter in tow. The last thing that I heard as the door closed behind me were the screams of laughter." 3rd place "It was the day before my 18th birthday. I was living at home, but my parents had gone out for the evening, so I invited my girlfriend over for a romantic night alone. As we lay in bed after making love, we heard the telephone ringing downstairs. I suggested to my girlfriend that I give her a piggy-back ride to the phone. Since we didn't want to miss the call, we didn't have time to get dressed. When we got to the bottom of the stairs, the lights suddenly came on & a whole crowd of people yelled "SURPRISE!" My entire family, aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins & all of my friends were standing there! My girlfriend & I were frozen to the spot in a state of shock & embarrassment for what seemed like an eternity. Since then, no-one in my family has planned a surprise party again." 2nd place "A lady picked up several items at a discount store. When she finally got up to the checkout, she learned that one of the items had no price tag. Imagine her embarrassment when the checker got on the public address system & boomed out for all the store to hear. "PRICE CHECK ON LANE 13. TAMPAX, SUPERSIZE." That was bad enough, but somebody at the rear of the store apparently misunderstood the word "Tampax" for "Thumbtacks". In a very business-like tone, a voice boomed back over the public address system: DO YOU WANT THE KIND YOU PUSH IN WITH YOUR THUMB OR THE KIND YOU BELT IN WITH A HAMMER?" AND THE WINNER IS ... ! This one happened at a major Australian University in October last year. In a biology lecture, a professor was discussing the high glucose levels found in semen. A young female freshman, raised her hand & asked, "If I understand what you are saying, there is a lot of glucose in male semen, as in sugar?" That's correct." responded the professor, going on to add some statistical data. Raising her hand again, the girl asked, "Then why doesn't it taste sweet?" After a stunned silence, the whole class burst out laughing, the poor girl turned bright red & as she realised exactly what she had inadvertently said (or rather implied), she picked up her books & without a word walked out of the class & never returned. However, as she was going out of the door, the professor's reply was a classic. Totally straight-faced, he answered her question, "It doesn't taste sweet because the taste-buds for sweetness are on the tip of your tongue & not in the back of your throat!"

 meaningful story to share Twenty years ago, I drove a cab for a living. It was a cowboy's life, a life for someone who wanted no boss. What I didn't realize was that it was also a ministry. Because I drove the night shift, my cab became a moving confessional. Passengers climbed in, sat behind me in total anonymity, and told me about their lives. I encountered people whose lives amazed me, ennobled me, made me laugh and weep. But none touched me more than a woman I picked up late one August night. I was responding to a call from a small brick fourplex in a quiet part of town. I assumed I was being sent to pick up some partiers, or someone who had just had a fight with a lover, or a worker heading to an early shift at some factory for the industrial part of town. When I arrived at 2:30 a.m., the building was dark except for a single light in a ground floor window. Under these circumstances, many drivers would just honk once or twice, wait a minute, then drive away. But I had seen too many impoverished people who depended on taxis as their only means of transportation. Unless a situation smelled of danger, I always went to the door. This passenger might be someone who needs my assistance, I reasoned to myself. So I walked to the door and knocked. "Just a minute," answered a frail, elderly voice. I could hear something being dragged across the floor. After a long pause, the door opened. A small woman in her 80s stood before me. She was wearing a print dress and a pillbox hat with a veil pinned on it, like somebody out of a 1940s movie. By her side was a small nylon suitcase. The apartment looked as if no one had lived in it for years. All the furniture was covered with sheets. There were no clocks on the walls, no knickknacks or utensils on the counters. In the corner was a cardboard box filled with photos and glassware. "Would you carry my bag out to the car?" she said. I took the suitcase to the cab, then returned to assist the woman. She took my arm and we walked lowly toward the curb. She kept thanking me for my kindness. "It's nothing," I told her. "I just try to treat my passengers the way I would want my mother treated." "Oh, you're such a good boy," she said. When we got in the cab, she gave me an address, then asked, "Could you drive through downtown?" "It's not the shortest way," I answered quickly. "Oh, I don't mind," she said. "I'm in no hurry. I'm on my way to a hospice." I looked in the rearview mirror. Her eyes were glistening. "I don't have any family left," she continued. "The doctor says I don't have very long." I quietly reached over and shut off the meter. "What route would you like me to take?" I asked. For the next two hours, we drove through the city. She showed me the building where she had once worked as an elevator operator. We drove through the neighborhood where she and her husband had lived when they were newlyweds. She had me pull up in front of a furniture warehouse that had once been allroom where she had gone dancing as a girl. Sometimes she'd ask me to slow in front of a particular building or corner and would sit staring into the darkness, saying nothing. As the first hint of sun was creasing the horizon, she suddenly said, "I'm tired. Let's go now." We drove in silence to the address she had given me. It was a low building, like a small convalescent home, with a driveway that passed under a portico. Two orderlies came out to the cab as soon as we pulled up. They were solicitous and intent, watching her every move. They must have been expecting her. I opened the trunk and took the small suitcase to the door. The woman was already seated in a wheelchair. "How much do I owe you?" she asked, reaching into her purse. "Nothing," I said. "You have to make a living," she answered. "There are other passengers," I responded. Almost without thinking, I bent and gave her a hug. She held onto me tightly. "You gave an old woman a little moment of joy," she said. "Thank you." I squeezed her hand, then walked into the dim morning light. Behind me, a door shut. It was the sound of the closing of a life. I didn't pick up any more passengers that shift. I drove aimlessly, lost in thought. For the rest of that day, I could hardly talk. What if that woman had gotten an angry driver, or one who was impatient to end his shift? What if I had refused to take the run, or had honked once, then driven away? On a quick review, I don't think that I have done anything more important in my life. We're conditioned to think that our lives revolve around great moments. But great moments often catch us unaware - beautifully wrapped in what others may consider a small one. People may not remember exactly what you did, or what you said, but they will always remember how you made them feel. hmmm... really? it seems like some dun. they might not even care.. r they people?...

 You are Form 9, Vampire : The Undying. "And The Vampire was all that remained on the blood drowned creation. She attempted to regrow life from the dead. But as she was about to give the breath of life, she was consumed in the flame of The Phoenix and the cycle began again." Some examples of the Vampire Form are Hades (Greek) and Isis (Egyptian). The Vampire is associated with the concept of death, the number 9, and the element of fire. Her sign is the eclipsed moon. As a member of Form 9, you are a very realistic individual. You may be a little idealistic, but you are very grounded and down to earth. You realize that not everything lasts, but you savor every minute of the good times. While you may sometimes find yourself lonely, you have strong ties with people that will never be broken. Vampires are the best friends to have because they are sensible. urlLink Which Mythological Form Are You? brought to you by urlLink Quizilla

 CREATING PERFECT RELATIONSHIPS? --------------------------------- A person visited the government matchmaker for marriage, SDU, and requested, "I am looking for a spouse. Please help me to find a suitable one." The SDU officer said, "Your requirements, please." "Oh, good looking, polite, humorous, sporty, knowledgeable, good in singing and dancing. Willing to accompany me the whole day at home during my leisure hour, if I don't go out. Telling me interesting stories when I need companion for conversation and be silent when I want to rest." The officer listened carefully and replied, "I understand you need television." There is a saying that a perfect match can only be found between a blind wife and a deaf husband, because the blind wife cannot see the faults of the husband and the deaf husband cannot hear the nagging of the wife. Many couples are blind and deaf at the courting stage and dream of perpetual perfect relationship. Unfortunately, when the excitement of love wears off, they wake up and discover that marriage is not a bed of roses. The nightmare begins. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- NO POINTING FINGERS A man asked his father-in-law, "Many people praised you for a successful marriage. Could you please share with me your secret?" The father-in-law answered in a smile, "Never criticise your wife for her shortcomings or when she does something wrong.Always bear in mind that because of her shortcomings and weaknesses, she could not find a better husband than you." We all look forward to being loved and respected. Many people are afraid of losing face. Generally, when a person makes a mistake,he would look around to find a scapegoat to point the finger at. This is the start of a war. We should always remember that when we point one finger at a person, the other four fingers are pointing at ourselves. If we forgive others, others will ignore our mistake too. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- NO OVERPOWERING Many relationships fail because one party tries to overpower another, or demands too much. People in love tend to think that love will conquer all and their spouses will change the bad habits after marriage. Actually, this is not the case. There is a Chinese saying which carries the meaning that "It is easier to reshape a mountain or a river than a person's character." It is not easy to change. Thus, having high expectation on changing the spouse character will cause disappointment and unpleasantness. It would be less painful to change ourselves and lower our expectations. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- RIGHT SPEECH There is a Chinese saying which carries the meaning that "A speech will either prosper or ruin a nation." Many relationships break off because of wrong speech. When a couple is too close with each other, we always forget mutual respect and courtesy. We may say anything without considering if it would hurt the other party. A friend and her millionaire husband visited their construction site. A worker who wore a helmet saw her and shouted, "Hi, Emily! Remember me? We used to date in the secondary school." On the way home, her millionaire husband teased her, "Luckily you married me. Otherwise you will be the wife of a construction worker." She answered, "You should appreciate that you married me. Otherwise, he will be the millionaire and not you." Frequently exchanging these remarks plants the seed for a bad relationship. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TRUST Trust is a very important factor for all relationships. When trust is broken, it is the end of the relationship. Lack of trust leads to suspicion, suspicion generates anger, anger causes enmity and enmity may result in separation. A telephone operator told me that one day she received a phone call. She answered, "Public Utilities Board." There was silence. She repeated, "PUB." There was still no answer. When she was going to cut off the line, she heard a lady's voice, "Oh, so this is PUB. Sorry, I got the number from my husband's pocket but I do not know whose number it is." Without mutual trust, just imagine what will happen to the couple if the telephone operator answered with just "hello" instead of"PUB". ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PERSONAL PERCEPTION Different people have different perception. One man's meat could be another man's poison. A couple bought a donkey from the market. On the way home, a boy commented, "Very stupid. Why neither of them ride on the donkey?" Upon hearing that, the husband let the wife ride on the donkey. He walked besides them. Later, an old man saw it and commented, "The husband is the head of family. How can the wife ride on the donkey while the husband is on foot?" Hearing this, the wife quickly got down and let the husband ride on the donkey. Further on the way home, they met an old Lady. She commented, "How can the man ride on the donkey but let the wife walk. He is no gentleman." The husband thus quickly asked the wife to join him on the donkey. Then, they met a young man. He commented, "Poor donkey, how can you hold up the weight of two persons. They are cruel to you." Hearing that, the husband and wife immediately climbed down from the donkey and carried it on their shoulders. It seems to be the only choice left. Later, on a narrow bridge, the donkey was frightened and struggled. They lost their balance and fell into the river. You can never have everyone praise you, nor will everyone condemn you. Never in the past, not at present, and never will be in the future. Thus, do not be too bothered by others words if our conscience is clear. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BE PATIENT This is a true story which happened in the States. A man came out of his home to admire his new truck. To his puzzlement, his three-year-old son was happily hammering dents into the shiny paint of the truck. The man ran to his son, knocked him away, hammered the little boy's hands into pulp as punishment. When the father calmed down, he rushed his son to the hospital. Although the doctor tried desperately to save the crushed bones, he finally had to amputate the fingers from both the boy's hands. When the boy woke up from the surgery & saw his bandaged stubs, he innocently said, " Daddy, I'm sorry about your truck." Then he asked, "but when are my fingers going to grow back?" The father went home & committed suicide. Think about this story the next time someone steps on your feet or u wish to take revenge. Think first before u lose your patience with someone u love. Trucks can be repaired. Broken bones & hurt feelings often can't. Too often we fail to recognise the difference between the person and the performance. We forget that forgiveness is greater than revenge. People make mistakes. We are allowed to make mistakes. But the actions we take while in a rage will haunt us forever. Pause and ponder. Think before you act. Be patient... Forgive & forget. Love one and all. If you judge people, you have no time to love them ---------------------------------

 Because She Would Ask Me Why I Loved Her by Christopher Brennan (1870-1932) If questioning would make us wise No eyes would ever gaze in eyes; If all our tale were told in speech No mouths would wander each to each. Were spirits free from mortal mesh And love not bound in hearts of flesh No aching breasts would yearn to meet And find their ecstasy complete. For who is there that lives and knows The secret powers by which he grows? Were knowledge all, what were our need To thrill and faint and sweetly bleed? Then seek not, sweet, the "If" and "Why" I love you now until I die. For I must love because I live And life in me is what you give.

 A woman brought a very limp parrot into a Veterinary Clinic. As she laid her pet on the table, the Vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest. After a moment or two, the Vet shook his head sadly and said, "I'm sorry, but Polly has passed away." The distressed owner wailed, "Are you sure? I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might be in a coma or something." The Vet rolled his eyes, shrugged, turned and left the room. Returning in a few moments with a beautiful black Labrador. As the bird's owner looked on in surprise, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the parrot from top to bottom. He then looked at the Vet with sad eyes and shook his head. The Vet escorted the dog from the room and returned a few moments later with a cat. The cat jumped up and delicately sniffed the bird. The cat then sat back, shook it's head, meowed, and ran out of the room. The Vet looked at the woman and said, "I'm sorry, but, like I said, your parrot is most definitely, 100% certifiably dead." He then turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill which he handed to the woman. The parrot's owner, still in shock, took the bill. "A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS!" she cried. "A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS just to tell me my bird is dead?!" The Vet shrugged. "If you'd taken my word for it, the bill would only have been $20, but... what with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan.....it's $150.00."

 Q. there are six eggs in the basket. six people each take one egg. how can it be that one egg is left in the basket? Q. acting on an anonymous phone call, the police raid a house to arrest a suspected murderer. they don't know what he looks like, but they know his name is John. inside they find a carpenter, a lorry driver, a car mechanic and a fireman play cards. without even asking his name, they immediately arrest the fireman. how do they know they've got their man?

 Not My Problem A little mouse living on a farm was looking through a crack in the wall one day and saw the farmer and his wife opening a package. The mouse was intrigued by what food the package may contain. He was aghast to discover that it was a mousetrap. The mouse ran to the farmyard warning everyone "there is a mouse trap in the house, there is a mouse trap in the house." The chicken raised his head and said "Mr. Mouse, I can tell you this trap is a grave concern to you, but it has no consequence to me and I cannot be bothered with it." The mouse turned to the pig "I am so very sorry Mr. Mouse, but the trap is no concern of mine either!" The mouse then turned to the bull; "sounds like you have a problem Mr. Mouse, but not one that concerns me." The mouse returned to the house, head down and dejected that no one would help him or has concerned about his dilemma. He knew he had to face the trap on his own. That night the sound of a trap catching its prey was heard throughout the house. The farmer's wife rushed to see what was caught. In the darkness she could not see that it was a venomous snake whose tail the trap had caught. The snake bit the farmer's wife. The wife caught a bad fever and the farmer knew the best way to treat a fever was with chicken soup. The farmer took his hatchet to the farmyard to get the soup's main ingredient. The wife got sicker and friends and neighbors came by to take turns sitting with her round the clock. The farmer knew he had to feed them, so he butchered the pig. The farmer wife did not get better, in fact she died and so many friends and family came to her funeral that the farmer had to slaughter the bull to feed all of them. So the next time we hear that one of our teammates is facing a problem and think it does not concern or affect us, let us remember that when anyone of us is in trouble, we are all at risk. LIFE IS A CELEBRATION. BE HAPPY & MAKE OTHERS HAPPY. Admonish your friends privately, but praise them openly.

 reading thru my blog i decide i should copy n paste it here again They have been married for two years. He loves literature and often posts his work on the net, but nobody ever reads them. He is also into photography and he handle their wedding photos. He loves her very much. Likewise with her. She has a quick temperand always bullies him. He is a gentleman and always gives in to her. Today, she's being wilful again. Her : "Why can't you be the photographer for my friend's wedding? She promised she'd pay." Him : "I don't have time that day." Her :"Humph!" Him : "Huh?" Her : "Don't have time? Write less of those novels, and you will have all the time you need." Him : "I... someone will definitely recognize my work some day." Her : "Humph! I don't care, you'll have to do it for her.! " Him : "No." Her : "Just this once?" Him : "No." Negotiation's broken. So, she gave the final warning: "Give me a Yes within three days, or else..." First day. She "withheld" the kitchen, bathroom, computer,refrigerator, television, hi-fi... Except the double bed, to show her "benevolence". Of course, she has to sleep on it too. He didn't mind, as he still has some cash in his pockets. Second day. She conducted a raid and removed everything from his pockets and warned, "Seek any external help, and you bear the consequences." He's nervous now. That night, on the bed, he begs for mercy, hoping that she'll end this state. She doesn't give a damn. No way am I giving in, whatever he says. Until he agrees. Third day. Night. On the Bed. He's lying on the bed, looking to one side. She's lying on the bed, looking to the other side. Him : "We need to talk." Her : "Unless it's about the wedding, forget it." Him : "It's something very important." She remains silent. Him :"Let's get a divorce." She did not believe her ears. Him : "I got to know a girl." She's totally angry, and wanted to hit him. But she held it down, wanting to let him finish. But her eyes already felt wet. He took a photo out from his chest. Probably from his undershirt pocket, that's the only place she didn't go through yesterday. How careless. Him : "She's a nice girl." Her tears fell. Him : "She has a good personality too." She's heartbroken because he puts a photo of some other girl close to his heart. Him : "She says that she'll support me fully in my pursue for literature after we got married." She's very jealous because she said the same thing in the past. Him : "She loves me truly. " She wishes to sit up and scream at him "Don't I?" Him : "So, I think she won't force me to do something that I don't want to do." She's thinking, but the rage won't subside. Him : "Want to take a look at the photo I took for her?" Her : ".....!" He brings the photo before her eyes. She's in a total rage, hits his hand away and leaves a burning slap on his face. He sighs. She cries. He puts the photo back to his pocket. She pulls her hand back under the blanket. He turns off the light, and sleeps. She turns on the light, and sits up. He's asleep. She lost sleep. She regrets treating him the way she treated him. She cried again, and thought about a lot of things. She wants to wake him up. She wants to have a intimate talk with him. She doesn't want to push him anymore. She stares at his chest. She wants to see how the girl looks. She slips the photo out. She wanted to cry and she wanted to laugh. It's a nicely taken photo of herself. A photo he took for her. She bends down, and kissed him on his cheek. He smiled. He was just pretending to be asleep. "You learn to love, not by finding a perfect person, but by learning to see an imperfect person perfectly."

 Brains A man has a car wreck and they have to amputate his brain. So the nurse takes him to the brain transplant wearhouse. On one side of the shelves are lined with brains marked $500.00 each. On the other side the shelves are lined with brains marked $200.00 each. The brainless man asks why the price differece. The nurse points to the $200.00 brains and explains that these are female brains, so they've been used. Brains for Sale A guy walks into a store to buy brains. He asks the woman behind the counter how much each of the brains cost. They saleswoman tells him, "$5/gram for women's brains, $20/gram for dog's brains, and $100/gram for men's brains." So the guy is surprised with the varying prices, and he asks the saleswoman, "How come men's brain's are so much more expensive than women's brains or dog's brains?" And the saleswoman replies, "Are you kidding!?!?!?!? Do you know how many men it takes to get a gram of brains????" nothing against anyone/anything juz jokes that i had come across dun quite understand the 1st one though heh

 Best Sales man : A young guy goes to a big department store looking for a job. The manager asks, "Do you have any sales experience?" The kid, "Yeah, I was a salesman back home". Well, the manager liked the young man, so he gave him the job. "You start tomorrow. I'll come down after we close and see how you did, but let me give you a bit of advice. If a customer comes looking, say, for toothpaste, you might suggest for him a toothbrush, or shaving cream etc. You get the idea?" "Of course,"the young man said. His first day on the job was rough but he got through it. After the store was locked up, the manager came down. "How many sales did you make today? The kid says, "One" The manager groans, "Just one? Our sales people average 20 or 30 sales a day. How much was the sale for?" The kid says, "$101,237.64." The manager exclaims, "What? $ 101,237.64? What did you sell him?" The kid, "First I sold him a small fish hook. Then I sold him a medium fishhook. Then I sold him a larger fishhook. Then I sold him a new fishing rod. Then I asked him where he was going fishing, and he said down at the coast, so I told him he was going to need a boat, so we went down to the boat department, and I sold him that twin engine Chris Craft. Then he said he didn't think his Honda Civic would pull it, so I took him down to the automotive department and sold him that 4X4 Pajero." The manager says "You mean a guy came in here to buy a fish hook and you sold him a boat and truck?!" The kid, "No, no, no, he came in here to buy a box of Kotex for his wife and I said, "Well, since your weekend's already screwed up, you might as well go fishing."
