 Nothing special this weekend... I thought of getting pretty early on saturday and went to bed by 12.30 friday night, Well, I got up by 8.00 am in the morning.. "Dont jump to conclusion.. that I got up very soon.... coz.. after watching the time piece.. I thought let me have some time more, so, the next dream came up ....(Xtremely sorry.. I cant reveal my dream dreams....) My uncle was about to leave office, so he woke me up by 9.30 am.. I asked him to lock the door.. and through the key inside thru window.. Hope he did the same.. Hence continued my sleep... Its now.. 12.00 noon.... Wow.. I thought I have slept for 12 hrs .. Its more than enough... As I was about to get up.. I thought what I am going to do now laying, in the bed.. But I dont know.. How come I slept. When I atlast woke up by 1.45 pm... Very early for the next day..;....(ha ha ah aha ha)... Atlast,, now myself got bored in my sleeping habit.. so I got up irrespective of the pipeline dream...and took my dresses for washing... finished them.. at times lend my ears to music.. and mouth to snacks...atlast I am fresh by 6.00 pm.. Went to temple nearby.. and came home to read newspapers...(pending over a week) Sunday:- Planned to got early.. dont take pretty early conclusion.. really I got early... by 6.40 am ... after sleeping by 1.00 pm day b4... read newspaper, made tea and had them.. dressed up to office... even b4 normal time... I am in the office by 9.40 itself...(nearly 25% days I will be in the office at this time) Came, gone thru the mails, had a chat with rajesh... Went to play table tennis.. superb match played for about 1 hours... then since I forgot my breakfast (intentionally, XcuseMe Rini) I felt very hungry.... so left to home, prepared food... and finished lunch by 3.30 pm... Next put the music... and the bed... slept till 5.00 pm (only one cycle) Then I got up since I have to go for Praedhosham.. Went & had nice dharshan.. in nearby Murugan temple.. Back to pavilion.... (System...) played hearts.. and heared music.. Then by 9.00 my uncle said he is going to chicago thru phone....(dont astonish.. its an 6 oscar film) I have to plan out for my dinner.. Went to punjabi daba.. and had a nice meals for dinner... Thatz all... The dinner is pretty heavy that I got up only by 8.45 am today.... back to office by 11.00 am... Ram

 Saturday went to my sis's place and a trip to lalbagh.. nice food and good cool day... sunday as is on most sundays, slept the whole day... just got up for the routine chores... looking forward to the holiday on 2nd... and if u r thinking (esp. rini) that I'm going home often... then here's more... I'm planning my April's quota on 12,13 .... lets see... and with "oru kaadhal vandhucho" (yeh ni romba azhaga irukka) song ringing in my earphones and slowly fading out to give way for the next song "engirundhu vandhaayada" (5 star)....

 Saturday : Nothing seemed to work out my way. I was on leave. Home was a noisy and busy place that day with lots of relatives. Waited till evening to get away from there. I thought that the evening would have been much better as my schedule had been booked. Nothing went right. had been waiting for the singing classes with a couple of friends for more than an hour from 5 pm. Noone else turned up. After a call to my friends, I learnt that the singing practice had been cancelled, but the choir practice was to be held at 7 pm. After a cup of coffee and went to my friends' home. As she was going to a prayer meeting being held all night, she said she would not be able to make it to the choir practice. Somehow managed to get to the church (Church of Resurrrection) on time. Same old story. "if you can wait and not be tired by waiting.." Except a few, nobody turned up. Myself and a couple of others have a practice of going to a church (Our Lady of Fatima) every Saturday and have some fast foods out every week. As usual went to the church. Actually, the main reason I took leave onn Saturday was to attend the all night prayer meeting at this church. Our choir was supposed to sing there. Almost all the English choirs of various churches were invited. But due to some last minute reasons, we were unable to sing. So we decided to participate there. Only myself and my friend decided to go to the church for the all night prayer. It wasn't meant to be so. I called him saying that I was ready to go. He said thaat he was feeling sleepy. So the day ended with a dissapointment. As I didn't feel sleepy, I decided to write a story. I wanted to dedicate this story for my friend. It is a birthday present to her. If anyone wants to read it, Send me a mail. I'll send it to you by mail. Sunday : Everything as expected. Got up late. Hurrried to get ready for Church. Made it on time. had a short practice as yesterday's practice got postponed. This week, our singing had improved a lot. last week it was a total mishap. informed everyone about the evening practice. By 3 pm, I realized I didn't have breakfast and lunch. Rushed home. had a hearty lunch. Played "Age of Empires" and "Age of Mythology". The computer opponent didn't put up much of a fight. So I won easily. Evening, had a singing practice. After that, we had a great discussion about education. Went back home after checking mails at 9 pm. No mails from anyone. Spent about 20 minutes deleting junk mails from my various mail ids. Spent another 20 minutes waiting for my friend to finish browsing. Went back home. Expecting your weekend stories, Jax .

 Hi everyone, I came across this website today while browsing. It is a very cool site. A very likely scenario that the world would be facing in the aftermath of Gulf War II has been beautifully potrayed as a urlLink Flash Game. Check it out!! Keep blogging, Jax. /credo, scio, durabo/

 Hi, Spent the last two mornings replying to mails from the group. It was a cumbersome and tedious process. Went home very late last night. Was not doing nothing much in particular at office yesterday. As a result, came in late today morning... Ranjini had asked mailed me something about my previous entry. This is for her. WMD -&gt; weapons of mass destruction, eg nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. dithers-&gt; hesitates. differs -&gt; thinks otherwise.

 Hi, My weekend was almost the same as RamG. Not a surprise... as I spent half of it with him. I've been given some designing work... I mean... design of a component. Just a high-level design. But I'm struggling for that itself. Coding, I can manage. But designing... its pretty tough work. But my PL is insisting on me thinking it out... In fact, I got more work... I need to prepare for a presentation on BizTalk' s response time that I was measuring over the past few weeks. Yet to get that started. And still some measuring needs to continue after we port everything to a 2 CPU server. That might take time. But as of now I'm doing some multi-tasking b'n ppt and designing... boy... this designing stuff is taking the heck out of me... Kicha

 Hi, On World Cup... So... Its all over... But not really... things r just beginning to build up... There r quite a few positive things that the Indian team can take forward after the world cup... 1. We were 202/5 after 34 overs. Scoring 200+ in 34 ov is not an easy task against an Aussie bowling attack. This goes to show our batting strength. But, the only trouble was all the bowlers had an off-day on the same day. 2. Dravid did decent job behind wickets all this time. From now on, they can look forward to grooming Parthiv Patel. He's an ecxcellent keeper and a fair batsman and above all he's only 16 !!! 3. Bangar was used as a frontline bowler when we went to WI and as a lower order one-day batsman when they came here. Right prospects to get a genuine all-rounder in the side which will effectively make India go with 5 bowlers. 4. With Parthiv in, as a specialist keeper, India might shuffle between Bangar, Agarkar and Dinesh Mongia depending on form and fitness of players. Srinath and Kumble are ageing and r already almost over-the-hill. 5. With Sehwag showing some weakness with the moving ball I feel they might well be back to Sachin-Sourav opening combination and Sehwag might come in the middle/late order to take care of slog overs. 6. Yuvraj and Kaif might also be retained for test matches. As these two have got excellent temperament and so could be quite a handful in the tests as they gain some experience. So, after all, nothing is lost.

 Hi, S we had a fantastic weekend (myself and kicha, on saturday), went to nandhi hills, superb place.. and fanstastic memorable hill resort which will cherish anyone... we had a great day over there, morning by 5.30 we got up after discussing a long about solution the day b4 and sleeping past mid night... catch bus by 7.20 to majestic, from there 8.30 to nandhi hills.. reached the base of the hill by 10.30.. had some refereshments over there, reached the top by 11.00... went roaming the entire hill for around 2 hours.. had breeze over the top mountain.. nice sleep for about 40 mts in the orchard...Okay food in a hotel... then by 2.15 took bus to blr... on the way to down...conductor (the point to be noted is LADY) stoped a bus in a shop to have tender coconut for them... Y ????? we should wait and watch them having those.. so we both ordered two for us.... and before I finish it... the driver has finished...and conductor (lady) also atmost finished.... the driver pressed the horn... to remind us to finish soon... but how dare she....Whistled and said "Right,,,, Right" no probs, Kicha has already finished.. and I also atmost... anyway we have paid also.. hence thatz all the scene over there.... Back to home by 5.30.. had chat by 6.30 b4 that a light tea...sent offf kicha...and heared songs.. went to bed... Sunday... got up early by 8.00 am....dressed up to office. by 11.00 am.... replied the hell no.. of mails (nearly 12 within 2 days...) and official nearly 6 within a day.... had some work for half an hour... and started browsing... by 1.40 came to know ganguly rarely won the toss..but prefered to field.. he taught as like new zealand, and pakistan... But Ricky's Pounding 9 sixes and unbeaten 144 most of u know... made a tremendous target for Indians to climb ...like Mt. Kanchenjunga... I watched at times.. had my lunch by 2.30... then came for browsing... then by 5.30 or so.. went to watch our play in the pitch..... since the target is huge.. I almost taught we lose and they deserve... anyway there is bit criples in my heart saying "WE should get the cup etc..like that" but sachins out in 4 and ganguly left the rest the Gang without a strong hold..assured the cup to aussie... Now shewag was doing fine.. and there was a bit rain.. so I thought yagas and yaganas are going for our pray.. to nature.. to abadon the match and restart.. but that too favoured aussies.. Who really deserve...But was quiet and calm... So I left the office by 9.00 after watching a little bit match here and there..to have a nice dinner and sleep... Thatz over with the weekend... Anyway just to encourage Rini... I typed these..coz..If some one is responding we should go with them.... have lot of work.. moving out.. since testing had to be completed b4 tommorrow's release... Bye Cheerfully Ram coming to kichas "A.C Muthaih..." Its human mind man.. finding way for the destination.... and that too.. Politicians and great heads... Has to say something.... they dont have enough time to think for Journalists questions... I am sure..Muthaih.. might have realised the same after 2 hours of delivering the news...

 Hi friends, Hei what a nice inning by aussies! Really they deserved it i beleive. Anyway most of the time , i flet the cup is for indians. Its really good that atleast theyw ent to final! Every body played well in their team and so our guys could not meet them with the same vigour. Its ok. So coz, of this match most of the people's weekend would have got spoilt......... But for a real cricket fan, aussi innings would have been a good feast. U know what, when we were travelling in bus to ISKCON yesterday morning, near M.G. road, u should see the josh of Bangaloreans....... There was a long proecession with a band of people playing, India will win and some thing like that. Then they were carrying a long flag around 50 - 60 metres length and in the end there was a tempo where in 4 purohits were sitting & doing a homam kind of thing. Even while returning in the afternoon, we could see so many indian flags fluttering. Reaally i felt them to be a bit stupid. Anyway its their way of expressing things and what does it have to do with me. But i watched whole of aussie innings and then watched till tendul got out. After that it was becoming so obvious that we will give away the cup to them. so got back to my personal work. So i dont feel i missed or messed my weekend! How about u people?

 After a long time, I enjoyed watching a part of nice Indian innings. As they dint surf channels often at my hostel, I was able to maintain my interest else, I would not have seen....... When I went hostel yesterday, Tendulkar's innings was over and it was Ganguly and Kaif who were batting. Though I had missed my favorite's play, Sourav never made us feel dull. All were telling, we wont be scoring more than 250( when I started watching it was 198/2 in some 42 over or so) but for me I was telling they will surely score more than 260, coz Kenya is not such a strong team and still over to go and we guys usually bat well in last five over and had the pitch been nice, then no doubt we would have crossed the 300 runs mark once again. But still last five over really it was nice with 3 sixes from Gang and one splendid effortless six from Yuvraj! Finally the score was 270 , more than what I had expected! But all these shots if they could replay with aussies then we can win! Lets wait and see. Somehow these guys are playing well and they are thru to finals. But it will be really lovely to see Ganguly lift the cup along with Sachin holding Man of the tournament award(which is for sure as he is the top run scorer with 669 runs to his credit in just 10 matches of this tournament) . Wish sachin to display his game once again as he did in Sharjah few years back and help us lift the trophy same like before. When Ganguly hit a super six, One caption was nice among audience displays, which is like "Beware of Gang of Ganguly". During India Pak match also they had some display which was also nice it seems. It was like "World peace for everyone and World cup for India." Last few over was really a nice feast to all cricket lovers. I dint see kenyans batting and so went upstairs and was reading a book " flowers and messages" and then went off to sleep as I was feeling so drowsy. Then got up and got back to the daily activities and now at office , mailing u as I am bit freeeeee. Only two days to go for the world cup finals and u guys are interested in war! Sorry i am in a sporting mood...........

 In an urlLink article in TOI, Mr A C Muthiah, president of Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said : "The aftermath of the war will give great opportunity for Indian engineering companies. We should be prepared to use Dubai as an entry point for steel and construction companies to supply construction material, he told reporters on the sidelines of the conference. We should chose Dubai as a warehouse and move the goods. The opportunity in the aftermath of war is fantastic," he said. Businesses are so SICK that they relish in attacking another country and destroying it - so that they can look forward to "rebuilding it and making great profits" !!! Man thats cool - someday some country could decide to bomb India - so that the business in that country (and their allied countries) can also make "profits".... Disturbing.... Kicha

 Hi everyone, The war has finally started in Iraq. My thoughts on the war: It is totally unwarranted for. I believe that this war is just an excuse for Bush to browbeat the world into acknowledging the US as a world's policeman. Bush says that the people of Iraq have been suffering under Saddam and that Saddam is bad for the people of Iraq. I guess if someone (say a leader of any other nation) believes that Bush is bad for US, that person can initiate a war to topple Bush's regime in US (same logic as US invasion of Iraq). Bush has also said that Saddam posseses WMD. Hans Blix differs. UN dithers. But tell what can the world if a couple of US special forces take into Iraq a few WMD devices and proclaim that they had captured it. Surely Bush would not allow anyone to inspect it clainmimg it as prize of war."Will America forget about nation building in Iraq -- the same way America forgot about nation building in Afghanistan -- urlLink as soon as the Iraqi oil wells are secured?" I can only feel sad that around 70% of the US citizens support "little Bush" in his war to depose the man from Tikriti. urlLink 'Today I weep for my country' While it's raining bombs in Baghdad, it is pouring at Durban. India's WC seems to be a washout. the Kenyans might have been washed out anyway on the field, barring a few dodos and pigs flying. With urlLink heavy rains predicted for the rest of the week in South Africa, I hope that this tournamnet doesn't go the way of the ICC Champions League held a few months back at Colombo. Hoping for your thoughts on the US invasion of Iraq... Jax.

 Hi, I certainly go with the article in "The Hindu"... Xavier u r right a sport cant be a religion... Also if u see, skill of a sportsman is not the same at any instance of time.... In sportsman's victory skill is one of the factor... But for scientist, artist, economist... etc... skill is the only factor... Since South Africa didnt entered into the super six stage we cant say they didnt deserve world cup... similarly since Kenya entered into the semifinal we cant say they deserve the world cup.... Hope u all get me... Ram

 Dear Kicha, I hope you had read this article in the "Hindu" on Sunday. If not, read it urlLink here . I hope that answers a few of your doubts. The founding fathers had an interest in sports. They might have never envisioned the growth of a sport as a religion. You might find that every constitution in the world doesn't allow sport as a major factor in public life. It might have been so in ancient Greece, but not in the present world. BTW. When is George Bush going to quote Shakespeare? urlLink "Cry Havoc!" and let slip the dogs of war. -Shakespeare, Julius Caesar III.i.270 . Jax

 hi, something to ponder... recently there has been some lines being spoken in political circles on conferring Bharath Ratna to Sachin Tendulkar. ur comments on that...??? but the legal terms for conferring Bharath Ratna, as on date, states that "This ward is given each year by President of India "for exceptional service towards the advancement of Art, Literature, Science and in recognition of Public Service of the highest order". check it out urlLink here ... this is from the constitution. u'll find that sports is ignored. May be the good ol' people who framed our constitution thought sports wasn't as important... Kicha

 Hi, I'm late... quite late by my standards. The great Tuticorin-BLR exp was late by over an hour and it was almost 10AM when I made it to my seat here... It was a pleasant weekend... what else could be a trip to home... couldn't see any of our friends there... but called on almost whoever is possible to be called... R Sindhu asked to convey her very BIG wishes to rini and also added that she's angry for not receiving mails for quite sometime... Others whoever I called asked me to convey my regards to everyone here... I talked to jax also over phone... Apart from calling on people I slept, slept and saw TV ... so that�s about my calm weekend. My April's quota of visit home might be in mid-April... Kicha

 Hi everyone, I have started a new blog of my own. It will contain mostly poems and prose that have touched my heart. urlLink Visit it... I also hope to soon put how each entry (prose or poem) has influenced me.. Bye, Jax.

 Once Again, Hearty welcome to Rini, into the Blogs site.. And for Xavi..... "I say...The team which Thinks Can Win... really WINs...." Thatz itt..... Wait & C the result.... India will have the WORLD cup in its hand...... Nothing more, Kicha... Now u will find that blogs posting are picking up.. so U can start with ur Bumpingss.... Ram

 It has been touted as one of most important games in the criket world cup - India vs New Zealand. Every Indian cricket fan wants revenge for India's performance at New Zealand. After the India-Pakistan match, this face-off was very much awaited for. But people keep forgetting the fact that cricket is a sport, where winning and losing is all part of the game. Yes, Cricket is a religion in India. I hope no one wants to be a religious fanatic. For the past one week, I have seen news reports which say that India is winning all its matches only after the fans at home had indulged in public humilation of the cricketers. This is ignorance and idiocy at its best. India got beaten by the best team in the world. That's it. Anyway, I will be rooting for India today. But I hope that the best team wins... urlLink Visit this...

 hi friends, Ooffffff i am off all the paper works now. Coz now we are ISO9001 certified company. Yesterday only our audit got over.

Happy......... I have got humpty of mails in my mail box to be checked. All ur mails only. Hei kicha i enjoyed reading words of Sachin. Will get back to u guys later Till then bye from Ranjini

 hope u people had a good night's sleep after seeing India's thrashing of the lankans... an interesting prospect is that India might end-up facing them again in the semis... lets see... meanwhile, am trying to work on that problem... waiting for my PL... got a meeting at 10AM... a new build tool has been developed by my unit, something on that... an interesting piece... try to get hold of this week's BusinessWorld.... the cover story is about NR Murthy.... turn to page 32 ... there's something about the unit I'm in now - SET Labs... Infy wants to increase its investment in research which is what this unit does... Kicha

 Microsoft Readies Its Answer To Autonomic Computing spacer By John Foley, InformationWeek spacer Microsoft next week will unveil its answer to autonomic computing, a software architecture and application-development approach called the Dynamic Systems Initiative. The first technologies to support the concept will be delivered as part of Windows Server 2003 when the operating system ships next month. Other elements will surface in Microsoft's development tools, applications, and management products over the next few years. The initiative represents Microsoft's attempt to provide a software environment for data centers that's more automated and efficient and less complex. "We're starting to deliver the plumbing that's necessary to do that," says Bob O'Brien, group product manager for Windows Server 2003. "We really see this as a dramatically different approach." Up first are new tools in Windows Server 2003 such as the Resource Manager, which gives more control over CPU and memory utilization, and Virtual Disk Service, for managing storage area networks. Next will be technology called Automated Deployment Service, to be unveiled next week, that will support what O'Brien calls "intelligent provisioning" of Windows and related software for faster setup on servers. If it works as promised, ADS, developed by Microsoft Research, will cut the time it takes to deploy servers from days to minutes, O'Brien says. Another related technology to be delivered this year is the virtual machine software that Microsoft is acquiring from Connectix. Microsoft's approach to data-center automation will require the participation of hardware companies, other software vendors, and systems integrators. It also means developers will need to think differently about the applications they build by designing software that runs across a more flexible infrastructure. "It's going to extend the way they build apps to include more intelligence in them via an additional design surface," says O'Brien. Microsoft will describe the ramifications for application development in upcoming conferences, though no changes to its VisualStudio.Net tools are expected this year. spacer

 GOTCHA!!!! I found the problem... now, the bigger problem is, I have to make some major changes to my code to get it to work with BizTalk... and that too... following the cricket score and with sachin almost on the verge of another 100... phew... Kicha

I checked my code.. it seems to be perfectly fine... I dunno where the hell the problem is... got to get my head cracking on that a bit... but only after lunch... Kicha

 I had great plans for the weekend. Thought of spending the weekend with my friends... But " the best laid plans of mice and men oft go awry " came true. this is what actually happened...

Kicha, visit urlLink this .

 I had a very fantastic weekend... Friday (7th Mar) left the office by 6.30 pm, Dressed up reached Bus station by 9.00 pm Myself and uncle took bus to tripathi.... by 0.30 am Mar 8th saw a gist of the super 6 match at a Motel... near chitoor... (Ganguly on Grease, India need 100 runs out of 92 balls to beat Kenyans) By 3 am we are in Tripathi, Reached railway station by 3.30 am and got Rs.60/- dharshan token (11.am scheduled time)... Get into a Dormetory for dressing up....By 5.00 am took bus to Sri Kalahasthi...(Siva Temple) very superbly maintained.... Nice dharshan there, (6.00 - 7.30 am) and back to tripathi by 8.00 am bus.... Took bus to Trimalah 8.30 am bus... Reached there by 9.30 am (nice journey,.... superb road etcc.....) Took a locker, placed our belongings there, went to the queue bye 10.00 am ... we have to wait for 4 hours... by 2.15 pm we got into the temple...from 2.30 to 2.35 pm Nice visit face to face with Balaji....

 Self-esteem is the reputation we acquire with ourselves -----RamG.... From Morning... I havent done anything so important... Just checking whether everything goes fine as a supervisor... And browsing...

 My PL was on travel last week. He's supposed to get back today. Waiting for him... I can't proceed until he gets back and helps me out with the BizTalk Server thing... I'm not able to make head or tails out of it. Meanwhile, I'm continuing to do some work with the other part of my application - reading some measurements (without BizTalk) of response time for a message from a 'send' to a 'receive' ... its throwing up some interesting results in fact... a 11 byte message takes on an avg of 300-340 ms while messages of 1K, 2K and 3K take less than 100 ms ... that is pretty consistent on different loads of 60,120,240,480 and 560 messages/minute... Got to study this a bit more... but I need to check the results with BizTalk too and waiting for my PL for that... Kicha

 Ah!! Two documents done. Got to go a long way still... Bye, Jax.

 That's the whole raison d'etre of this blog. If people get interested and are ready to post atleast once a day, we can include them. Also it would be helpful for us to read the FAQs to understand the possibilities and limitations of blogging. Guess what, I am supposed to prepare 13 x 2-page pdfs. I think it might eat up my entire day today. More later, Jax.

 Not many cared about batchmates did they...? and not many r going to care this too if we r trying to increase the strength to beyond a level. Only people who r constantly accessing mails throughout the day may be interested in this. So, that makes me feel that this is not going to be a hit by any standards if posted to msitmmb and asking people to join. The smaller with better accessible people, the better. We can post some useful things like the grammar stuff and some interesting pieces, technical or otherwise in this and use the mails for our normal communication like my start-of-the-day routines and whenever we expect some specific reply. In that way we can have the best of both worlds. BTW, jax try to find out how to post images/files to this. coz, that'll be very useful... Kicha

 Hai Alll, Nice.... This shouldnt go unaddressed as like Batchmates or in the process like our yahoo groups and lastly in the line our Instant reply squad.... RamG

 This entire week has been consumed by a translation work. Using machine translation engines has become a double edged sword. They allow quicker translations that are free, but the translations are illogical. I wanted to translate Plant (the green one which has leaves and flowers on it); Google's translation service is adamant on giving the translated word for plant( the one with lots of people and machinery spewing out pollution. Got to translate a lot of pages... French, German, Italian, Dutch (My head is already spinning with words). I'm still searching the net for free translation engines..

 Hey, Visited more sites after tea. This time, I got hooked onto to technology and its recipe for the future. Here are two articles. If you can spare the time, you can read them. urlLink Six Technologies That Will Change the World urlLink Bringing the EBooks home I just don't know how I got to these links. I seem to keep going on and on round the Internet. It's almost 5 p.m. here. So got to go. Blog you all later, Jax

 Here's another list that I visited today from my browser's history list: urlLink Michael Alpern urlLink An interesting concept. Let us see if we can use it for our blog here. urlLink Micro Content urlLink Dave Barry urlLink Freak Watchers urlLink VinBlog Bye, Jax . I have not yet stopped browsing. urlLink As it is raining heavily outside, I might get caught at office beyond my working hours. I have got a choir practice to go today evening. Hope the rains stop so that I can make it. Ah! the sun has started shining again. The humidity is making me sweat a lot. As Kicha knows, our office is on the top floor, so the heat gets to me very quickly. Kicha, saw your photos yesterday. Mmmm! looks like a very good computer to me (Dell). I like the black coloured PC's very much. Send the config of your system to me later. I am here stuck up with a very old Cyrix PC, that likes to test my patience and endurance to its limit. As a part of my motto is urlLink Durabo , I have to put up with it. Well my colleagues are calling me for tea. Got to go...

 Hi, Browsing the web has become very addictive. I just cannot resist from clicking on any hyperlink that appears on a webpage. I spent the morning visiting all types of sites catering tastes ranging from urlLink gossip to the unused but very useful urlLink technological ideas. Here is a small list of the sites / blogs I've been reading today urlLink http://nontroppo.org/ urlLink Alex Halavais urlLink Meg Hourihan There are still a lot of websites that I have visited today. I am thinking of adding a sidebar that will list a few of the sites that I or you have visited. It can be done, but requires a little bit of programming and tweaking techniques. As I am not the technical expert in this group, I feel that our techie friends can try thier hand at this. Bye, Jax . Before I go, I need a favour from you all. Can you suggest me a good gift for a frind of mine? It is a she, aged 23. Something that would appeal to the feminine side. (No jewellery please). Something simple and elegant.

 just a passing thot... we celebrate Saraswathi pooja by not studying on that day... we celebrate "workers day" (May day) by not working on that day... any thots why (or why shouldn't we)...???

 Hi, oh jax... Ram and Rini have the facility of dropping into the Bangalore Golf Club anytime, but Kicha is blessed with a mini-Golf course within the campus of his company. But I'm not sure, to what extent he'll utilise this blessing. and currently I'm reading... IBM MQ Series-1 urlLink IBM MQ Series-2 Need to compare its performace with BizTalk Server and prepare the next version (ver 0.2) of the current white paper (which is under review). I've given a timeline to my PL that the work will be done by June 20th. So, have to switch to the next gear. and jax, the paper will not appear at infy.com ... it is an IP of infy and will be used by the Technical Architects and/or Project Managers who will go in for consultation for the clients.

 Hi everyone, I'm back. Actually I have got a lot of work to do, but I don't feel like doing so. So I'm whiling away time browsing websites. Especially as my boss is out of town, everyone is feeling relaxed. Any way, Thursday is a holiday. I want to rest at home. Life seems so boring nowadays, especially in the evenings. Not being the type that enjoys going out, I feel so bored. I tried to learn a few languages like Latin and Icelandic. No, nothing worked out right. How's life at your ends, guys and gals? Same story?.. Ram, Golf is not only a game for great personalities, but it is one game that gives you a great personality. The wide open spaces, the thick woods, dotted with water hazards and dangerous bunkers. I only wish I could get into a golf course and have a few swings. Sindu seems to have the luck. Ram, Kicha and Rini have the facility of dropping into the Bangalore Golf Club anytime. The only golf course in Coimbatore is almost 20 kms away. The woods are lovely, dark and deep, But I have sites to visit and blogs to read.. Currently I am reading urlLink k10k.net urlLink Elegant Hack urlLink Rebecca's Pocket Adios,

 hi, Thanks Ram....i'll try follow what u said..though its really hard for me to do anything without fighting.... Congrats Kishore......I could well imagine how ur presentation would have been.....keep going....u know even i got one presentation t'row....but not to professionals but to my English Teacher...she wants to observe my accent first..and then she will train me on the British accent.... Oh jax....thanks for teaching me the right words...i may need it very often....... oh..my boss is calling me..... catch u later guys Sindu

 Hi, Sindu, GR8 n Good, its famous personalities Game, Try to play well instead of fighting well... Congrats Kicha on your initial attempt............ Saturday till 2 pm I slept after a GR8 work till 3 am. Sunday as usual for washing and evening came to office to finish the pending work over the weekend. Monday, I had a lot of typing works to be completed hence couldnt update you, although I enjoyed reading the blogs posted by others..... about me......... ( Ram / Sagitarius / Bangalore / Table Tennis, Surfing, Reading ) I have some testing yet to be finished will update u later

 Hi, Sindu, you call them "golf clubs". There are usually 9 clubs in a set. Each club has its feature. Be careful with them. You can kill a person with one. Especially with a 5 Iron. Kicha, Good to hear that your presentation went very well. Hope to see your paper on Infy.com soon. Will get back to you all later,

 Hi, My sample for the right-side panel: Kicha / Virgo / Madurai, Bangalore / Surfing, Music, Reading n Talking Business

 Hi, A memorable day for me. Just had my first presentation of my professional career. Things were different here. My PL gave me his Laptop to load the ppts to take to the conferance room. I've never touched a laptop until today and here I was struggling to roll my finger over, to move the mouse-cursor. Though presentations are nothing new to any of us, this audience was different... In our class, I could bluff anything about technology and seem smart and get away with that. But here, people know a hell lot more than me... about all I talk... But they acted within my limitations. And, of course, my PL was there to rescue me whenever I showed any slightest hint of doubt in answering something. The presentation went on for about 1 hr and 40 mins including the Q&A time. At the end of it all, I got the same feedback that I got during my MS(IT&M) presentations - Talking too fast....!!! Guess, I need to do more mending on my "express speaking" ways... Overall, it was a very satisfying presentation for me. And furthermore, the white paper that I've prepared (and which, the presenatation was all about)... is gone for a review. Once it is done then my first white paper will be released across infy.

 hi friends, just now came to terms with the fact that its monday morning and i have plenty of work piled up...im still not out of the weekend mood.... on sat..we had been to Birmingham to send off one of Boomi's friend who was leaving to India.....after dropping him off at Airport we started to Oxford...to visit yet another Boomi's friend.....the Oxford city is flooded with colleges....it has around 25 colleges with huge campuses...old buildings...only one college is built recently with modern architecture.... amidst huge oppsition from the public. Oxford is a bit smaller when compared to Cambridge....New college is located in Cambridge(Nehru studied here)..the whole city is so lively with students all round the globe...cambridge is the largest city with Cycle population in Europe.... on Sunday morning V called our parents..Boomi complained to my parents that im not cooking these days....so gave him a bang on his back.....then we went to Churchill gardens...the place where were Winston churchill was born...the place is so huge that u have small shuttle train running inside the campus....there is a place where golf game is open for public.....so i got geared up and started playing with Boomi as my opponent....v ended up fighting with the golf strikers(i dont what u call that!)..... after that it was time for us get back to hinckley..its 2 hrs drive from Oxford.... for the past 2 days the weather was ok...but today again it is cold, rainy and windy...so asked Boomi to drop me in my office.....so here iam still strugling with the stupid accent once again..... cheers Sindu

 Mes Amis, At last, I with my friends get to sing for a wedding mass. One of our friends is getting married next monday (May 5). She wanted us to sing for her wedding. So at last we get a long awaited chance. So I'll be busy this week with practices et al. By the way, what happened to Sindu? No message from her? Still trying to understand the British accent of her clients. If you notice I have swapped the team and archives sections. Kicha, try to put the web addresses that you sent within anchor tags. I spent a few seconds clicking on them, before realizing that they were not hyperlinks. It would be nice if you give them as hyperlinks, or even better if they open in a new page with target="_blank" option. My weekend went like this. Sunday : Church - browsing (Chatted with Rajesh and invited Vijay Babu to the blog) - Evening Choir Practice - Night Treat for my friend's birthday. My idea for the right side panel: small bios like Name / Star sign / Location / Hobbies. I am giving my sample: Jax / Pisces / Coimbatore / Reading, writing and music . Rini seems to be busy with her wedding preparations. Anything we could help you with? Expecting everyone's comments and suggestions,

 and one more interesting one... http://y.20q.net:8095/btest

 jax, an intersting link on the history of spam... for the favourite links section... American Scientist has a fine article by Brian Hayes summing up the history of spam and proposed measures to deal with it." http://www.americanscientist.org/Issues/Comsci03/03-05Hayes.html A shorter article along the same lines is running at The Economist http://www.economist.com/business/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1734216

 Hi, This is great work jax. And this is why I insist that u retain the admn rights with urself alone. Friday, I was down with fever. And, thanks to my PL, my presentation got postponed to today and am back to full strength. Saturday I was waiting for Ramgopal to call me at my house. But didn't receive his call. It was in late sunday afternoon that I realized the secrect behind why Ramg didn't call me - our phone was out-of-order. Today, I'm looking forward to the first presentation that I'm giving in my corporate life. And its great to see the blog growing. All credits to jax, as he was the one who first introduced this concept of WebLogs to all of us. This is getting exciting by the day. Kicha

 Dear Rini, Ok, Don't get heated up on the chicken and duck thing. Regarding the layout, I'm still experimenting with it. The design might change anytime. We have got a few space on the right to post our favorite links. Send a few good ones. We will utilize the space well. There is also some space on the left. I'm thinking of swapping the archives section and the team section. Hey, what do you think about posting a small bio of each member? Everyone tell me what to put there... I am expecting a lot of content to be put over there. A small request to everyone, don't send your mail to me at my office id. I am getting a lot of mail to this id. And also anyone can view the mails, that's why. If it is anything urgent, you can post it to the blog or my personal id. Hope you understand. I have also modified the blog entry to display the name of the blogger. So no more worries on wondering who posted the message. Also no need to sign your name everytime. Bye,

 Hei guys, what is this, calling me as chicken and duck? If you people are really interested in such kind, sorry i am not and i wont be. So we better stop with this in our blog atleast! And jax regarding the new layout of our blog, its good! but i feel with white background it will look still more good. Why dont you give a try! Hei sindhu, Welcome.... Nice to hear all your work related things out there! Why are you going to resign rajesh? Ok tell me when u call up to my home this weekend! Hei only now the marriage preparations are becoming jaroor! Ya Silk saree discount has started and i am going to be busy with purcahse of sarees. Any new designs you people encounter among your family members, kindly recommend a word of it to me too. This weekend too was musical for me. Jax dont envy me ok! Hmmmm...... This time it was instrumental and not vocal! Guys though i dint know about it much i really enjoyed the music. Its so tantalising and soothing in that summer sunday evening under that pale white shaamiyana. Ya actually we were not for sure if the concert would be good or not. But as i had to get back to hostel, we have to start at 8 o clock from there and so were in a dilemma, but then we gave a try. Now coming to the music concert. It was a Violin concert by Dr. N. Rajam. She really made us enjoy instrumental like anything. Though it was my first time to an instrumental concert, i could still enjoy the lingering of violin strings in my ear! When i started, i was telling him, that i wont be able to listen to instrumental and will be asleep half way down the concert....... But to my surprise i was awake every second, searching for something to understand the music and also enjoying my search. I have to depart fully loaded with enchanting music at 8 o clock! It was not too crowded like Nithya's concert. But it was a worthy evening for me. Before that in the morning we went to Music World and i bought one more casette of Nithyasree. Its a casette on one particular composer.(Othhukaadu Venkata subbaier, my favourite and the one who has composed Alaipaayuthey kanna song). I did see two more casettes at the concert displays, but as it was by sudha Raghunathan, so i decided to get it later! Hei vijay come join us soon! Ok guys will meet u later Till then Cares and shares Ranjini

 Hi Rajesh, Welcome to the blog and you said Ranjin was a Koli. I thought she was a Vathu. I can console you on the loss of the cellphone connection but don't expect my sympathy for your Ranjitha. If you want, you can spend the wholee day calling her or waiting in froint of the Reliance office (as you are free now), Vijay Babu wants to join us, I'm told by Rajesh. Seems like we are getting a lot of new faces to join us. Kicha and Ram take note. So i'll be sending him an invite now. Bye, Jax.

 hi friends atlast all my problems regarding this blogger came to an end now and im inside this blogger now.thanks to all who helped me in this matter.Here in chennai My life is going on well till now in reliance by having a free mobile connection.But im planning to resign my job this month.Can u guess two things that make me feel bad in leaving this job? It is 1.Brand of the company and the job 2.Salary if u are going to think as above then you are a chicken like ranjini and sangee.The real two things that make me cry in leaving this job are 1.Free mobile connection given to me from reliance 2.The receptionist of reliance (Ranjitha) Even im going to lose these after my resignation im quitting this job whole heartedly.So i expect all of u to console me for this and pray so that i get a job where i can get a mobile and a gud receptionist. nice in joining this blogger raapi

 My search for a good blog layout continues... I spent the entire day visiting several blogs to understand thier layout. I think it is time to put the HTML skills and Control C + Control V skills to use. How does the new layout look? Took me a lot of time and hand coding with ^C & ^V. A few technical details about the layout: Fluid design. Uses CSS. The content will automatically resize to fit into the window size. Try changing the size of the browser window and look at the content. Will get back later, Jax.

 welcome sindu welcome, Hope u enjoy this blog............ by way Ganja, rajesh has joined and no mesg. from him towards the blog page......... Y so..... SoooooooooooBUsssssssssssyyyyyyyyaaaaaaaaaaa?????????? not only for u sindhu, me too the same................. one day its all fun...exploring things....the next day it becomes a nightmare..... not nightmare, actually boring and night work.................hectic......and not interesting also........ Stilll I want to get into this.........coz........this platform I like (Unix, Linux, AIX, Solaris) and more over the technology. Internet protocol design & telecommunication stacks............ its ok..........today also I have a lot of FTP process to be done since good link is available only at night. Ram

 Hi friends, nice to meet the good old friends thru a different means.... we all came together to pursue our career under the same roof.... in the name of M.S(IT & M).....days gone by ...we all went in different directions, marketed ourselves in diffrent foms...but still clinging onto the network.....allright enough of my dialogue session.... I find my job as a roll-a-coaster ride.....one day its all fun...exploring things....the next day it becomes a nightmare.....anyway i like it... The worst part of my job is talking to a Brit over phone.... I think this is enough for an intro..... catch u later guys.. bye Sindu

 Hi, jax, a suggestion. Why don't you alone retain the admn rights. I feel, rather then each one of us having the rights and going about things, it would be more organized if one person could take charge of things and if anything needs to be done, we can request you to change. At times, if it becomes difficult for u for some reason to go about things u can temporarily give rights to someone for that purpose alone and then revoke it later when u r back. I feel, that'll keep it more organized just like msitmmb is doing good (admn-wise). However, others also share ur views on this before taking a decision. And today... am not feeling well. Have some temperature. I was supposed to take a presentation today, but (thank GOD) my PL postponed it to monday on my request but asked me to have the presentation for the entire MSPSG (Ms Platform Solns Group) Team... rather than to the EAI Team alone (a sub-group within MSPSG, to which I belong). Good... I have less strain today. I have to learn a new concept called Remoting to leverage on the performance tests that I had been doing. So, I'll spend the rest of the day brooding over MSDN... atleast I hope to be back to full strength for the presentation on monday. Ganja: type ur name below ur post... the name does not automatically come in dayswork.blogspot.com page. So, this small request from my part... (if u think I being kind to u, refer ur offline msgs)... Kicha

 Hi friends, It is good to see you exchanging your views. As more people are joining us, I feel that we should help those joining us. I had asked if anyone can prepare an user manual sort of doc. As I had invited you all to the blog, I don't know the exact sequence of steps that you followed to join the blog. The doc can be like: 1. After receipt of invitation to the blog, what to do? 2. Whether you have to create a blogger account etc. If you noticed any change in the blog layout, don't worry. I was just trying to get a few things right like the layout and colour scheme. Sinduja had mailed me about her joining us. I noticed that she had two invites to the blog. In order to avoid duplication of efforts, temporarily I have removed the admin rights for all. I'll restore them later when the blog's layout scheme and other features are decided upon. You can continue your postings as usaul they won't get affected at all. Will get back later today, Jax.

 kicha,,,,, Let me not criticize about ur confirmation that u r 2 and myself 1 according to YOU BUT I HAVE TO MAKE A POINT HERE....................... how sure u say that YOU R really TWO...............???????????????? If at all.................think for a while.............U r pulled and pushed into Mainframe............ But.,....Favourably situation (sorry..........Ur Mail..........) made u towards BizTalk Server......... U can judge me as One or even zero......its upto you..........deciding person........ But the reality only is known to me.......... Frankly speaking............ "One person......spends his entire life........ Thinking that the other person thinks about him like this............ But the reality only the other person know.....not this person" hope u all get this point.......... No more, comments on this.......let me get to Jax discu.. itself later.... bye cheers Ram

 hi all , oops ! rajesh is having some problems in joining this blogger.so invite him again .then about going abroad we will think about it and start pouring our opinions tomorrow,bcoz now i have to think about going to my office.

 Hi, Nope, ramg... it doesn't conflict... to be more precise... point no.1 is YOU point no.2 is ME if u still can't understand, leave it... and jax, fine all u said... but whats that last line of urs... "Really, I would like to know your views on going abroad." And to give another precise reply, "I don't prefer going abroad".period. I'm making a presentation tomorrow morning on my findings on the performance of BizTalk Server.... the first one of my corporate life... Kicha

 hai all, thanx for inviting me to the blogs.then iam in a hurry to move on now .got to meet a customer(hahahah) mail u in detail tomorow. urs ganja

 Yeah, Since Jax wishes let me also jump into the arena.................. wah wah wah..........Rini..............Exactly U r right...........It cant be denied................. I go with that,,,,,, Then coming to Kicha...............whatz that man.............?????? There r 2 categories of people. 1. the "anything will do" kind 2. and the "nothing but this" kind the 1s are ready to accept any kind of job. They might have a primary interest but may be ready to compromise it for anything under the sun as long as they r having the expected benefits out of the job. The 2s will not think of anything but what is in their mind (unless personal/family circumstances force them to go otherwise). Note that.........u have started 1s as anything will do........and ended them with expect benefits .................doesnt it condradict....!!@!! k, I have some work...........Let me come later.........with my views.. .. typed freely at home and bring it here.............. Bye, Ram Hearty welcome to new blogers (Kavi, Rappi, Ganja.............) cheerfully blog.....and share.................

 Hi friends, i am also eager to join you people, but that as i told, i am a bit occupied and thats restraining me from adding my views to the blog. But then i can see that from Jax and Kicha's views there are few factors affecting the mindset of the people. 1. Not enough of awareness on the options available regarding IT related jobs is the first factor. 2. Inablilty of the teacher's to bring those options on to the students. In many cases its becoming now obvious that students excel teachers and they teach their own teachers. 3. Apart from this, i think, as an individual, the student himself doesnt know which field is suitable for him. Human nature is so complex and is a mixture of various aspects that it makes difficult for everyone to understand what is one's own strength and what one must pursue. Very few of them know feebly what will suit them and what they want to pursue in their career(including me). And very rarely few of them know exactly what is it they need and strongly pursue them. And most of them i hope u all know what i am going to say....... Yes i repeat, dont know what is one's own strength and what one must pursue! Its by trial and error and after many attempts one discovers what is needed and what is the exact match amongst many options available. More views on this in my later blogs! Ok friends lets welcome Ganesh, Rajesh and Kavitha to our group! Wish them happy blogging. bye for now from Ranjini

 Hi, It is true that there is no data available to prove that other computer related workers rise faster in the corporate ladder than programmers. It is perfectly true that growth is more of a personal interest and proactivity. The hidden meaning is that I said most, not all programmers. But tell me Kicha, be true to your heart and mind and tell me what chances are there for a programmer to enter into top management in a company. I admit the same chances apply to other posts also. The reason is programmers are seen with a notion that you say them something they do it. More of an command-following group. Again I have no data to back me up. I recall a quote by Mark Twain, " There are three types of lies: lies, damned lies and statistics ". As for your query for course, there are indeed several courses available for other IT jobs I had mentioned. But the truth is everyone, including knowledgable persons, believe that programming is the de facto definition of an IT job. They tend to forget that it is more of a supportive job. Why, the entire industry is a supportive industry. The reasons why the educational sector for these areas are still gray are obvious. Can you really justify that you are taught only programming. I accept that we have had labs only for programming. But we were in the science stream, you and me. Ask Ranjini about the labs she had. She can tell you lots. We had a paper called Computer System Architecture. If you had really got hooked onto the subject, you would have been a system administrator by now. There was a paper called Computer Graphics. If I had been interested, I could've become a Multimedia artist by now. The truth is that there were opportunities galore in front of us. The truth is that we never acknowledged them. You had started your points on there being two kinds of people. You said that the 2nd type was focussed. But you ended somewhere on the lines of them being losers. Can you enlighten me on the above.BTW, which type do you consider yourself? the first or the second. Ii can tell you I am somewhat of a fifty-fifty. I had determined not to take up a programming job, reasons being already mentioned. I was also passionate about writing, as you all know. When an opportunity presented itself, I grabbed it with both hands (writing and technology). I never rue it at all. But some think otherwise. Even last week, my friend's mom told me I was not utilising my talents. I asked her what my talents were. She said knowledge and writing. I said I am utilising it through my work. She didn't agree with me. Really, I would like to know your views on going abroad. Bye, Jax. Ram : This blog is for discussion alone. So feel free to post your thoughts about the matter. I am eager to know what you feel about this. Anyway discussions help us a lot to understand others better. Remember "empathy", "putting oneself in other's shoes" etc. So I will be waitng for yours and Ranjini's comments. Kicha : I had given all of us admin privileges. So you can add them yourself. Anyway, don't take the trouble. I have send them the invitations. If possible, try helping them out to join the blog. If I have the time, I'll try to prepare a user manual sort of thing to help those joining us. But if any of you have the time, prepare one yourself and send it across to me for finetuning. I'll be busy for the next two days. BTW, can anyone suggest me a good, informational site. I need it for my monthly newsletter. It should be helpful for lay persons. Because most of the people who get to read the newsletter are not always techno savvy. This is urgent. It would really be great if I get it by 1600 hrs IST.

 SMART is... Simple Measurable Achievable Realistic TImebound Kicha

 Hei..........If I also started discussing the matter then it will lead to an endless written discussion..... Hence I stoped b4 starting............. coming, What is that "SMART" we were thaught in Raja Sir's class...... Congrats xavier for your First anniversary.........By way when r u planning for treat............pending over a year... nothing more, have a lot to be done......within this week... so update u later. Ram

 Hi, jax brings up a nice topic. I could talk hours on it... There r 2 categories of people. 1. the "anything will do" kind 2. and the "nothing but this" kind the 1s are ready to accept any kind of job. They might have a primary interest but may be ready to compromise it for anything under the sun as long as they r having the expected benefits out of the job. The 2s will not think of anything but what is in their mind (unless personal/family circumstances force them to go otherwise). The first lessons need to start in college. It is up to the faculty to bring to the notice of students the various avenues opened up by an industry they r dealing with. Tell me, how many in our class had an idea of what their genuine interest was, at the time of studying, and of the few people who had, how many went on to work precisely where they wanted to (excluding people forced by personal/family circumstances). It is the inability in analysing themselves and the industry, that is the cause of such ignorance. It is only in the hands of the faculty to groom them. But having said that, the faculty themselves need to update at a faster pace to keep their students at their toes - not something which boasts a good statistic. And no wonder the situation told by jax arises. Now decide, who's to be balmed. On his second point of growth in their field of work... It all depends on the interest and proactivity exhibited by the individual. What data could be provided to say that "Web Designers, Multimedia Artists, Marketing, System Administrators, Technical Writers, Customer Support, Administration & Support, System Analyst, Visualizers, Interaction/Information Designers" (and people in all other non-programming IT jobs) move faster to higher management levels than programmers. It all depends on the individuals' interest, learnability, enthusiasm and proactivity. People assume that working in IT means programming because thats how their faculty have taught them in colleges. How many colleges/courses/papers are there for the above jobs. They certainly fall less in number than things related to programming. But not all get genuine interest in programming, but they r taught nothing but programming - this is the paradox that students have to live with. IT is more of a "help urself" industry for students. They cannot expect this input from college, still they need to have it. Or else, they will be languishing on what job to search for looong after they've completed their education.... Kicha

 Hi friends, Today, I complete one year at Angler. I didn't know that days could rush so quick. The past one year had been a helluva an experience. There were good times, not so good times, moments I would cherish and some I wish that had never happened at all. Looking around me, I find that there are people who had left the company in the past one year and those who have come in the same time. Reminiscing on the past year, I've learned a lot. A lot about people, responsibilities, expectations, organisations, clients, peers, work and most of all, life itself. People have criticized me for choosing a line of work that is very remotely linked with my qualifications. But I believe that they are wrong. When some one asks me what I do. My reply is that I work for an IT company. Thier next question is ' As what, a programmer? ' or ' VB or ASP etc .' I say ' No. I am a content developer .' They say ' Oh, what does that mean? ' I start by saying that I am responsible for the creation of the content or text for websites, multimedia cds, marketing brochures etc. They say ' Oh, a writing job or a documentation work .' God, how many times have I restrained myself from catching them by the throat and throttling them. Don't people ever understand that they are a lot of jobs in the IT industry other than programming. People have got it ingrained in thier mind that if you work for an IT company, then you are a programmer. Frankly saying, it was this attitude of people that made me decide not to work in the IT industry as a programmer. I don't want to be one of the thousands of nameless, faceless people programmers in the IT industry, who are just content in developing the code for an application. Most of them don't get a chance to expand thier horizons. They are mostly satisfied in thier job role. They start as programmer trainees and move up the corporate ladder as maybe a programmer, senior programmer, team or project leader. Very few break the invisible ceiling into the top management. They get stuck into mostly the lower middle or middle management. A few of my programmer friends might get a little upset over the above statements, but it is the truth. Coming back to jobs in the IT industry, as said earlier there are lots of other jobs that are paramount for any IT company. Web Designers, Multimedia Artists, Marketing, System Administrators, Technical Writers, Customer Support, Administration &amp; Support, System Analyst, Visualizers, Interaction/Information Designers and still a lot of technical designations I cannot remember. By the way, my job profile includes: 1) Developing content for websites, multimedia cds, marketing collaterals (includes brochures, flyers etc.) 2) Editing the company's monthly newsletter 3) Act as company's spokesperson to the outside world(through newsletters, emailer campaigns, company marketing collaterals etc.- According to my CEO) 4) Prepare user manuals for software applications (Currently, I have not involved myself in this aspect, but will do so very soon) Bye, Jax. Kicha: Send me Rajesh's and Ganesh's email ids. Tell them about the unofficial rules of the blog.

 Hei guys, you all have made me feel my day special in different ways. By this simple and elegant wish Jax conveyed me wishes which is one of the unique wish i got today though he had sent me his gift in the form a story already!. I liked the way Kishore, made attempts to catch me over phone to wish me though he had mailed me his wishes! when i was waiting for Ram's wish, (the only blogger left) he came out with a most stunning card! Ya a card which carried Mother's message. How sweet!! I was really impressed. I was carried away by the sincerity with which he visited the site which i used to visit almost daily and decide before hand itself to send me a card with Mother's message on my birthday. Thank you guys. Its all your wishes and wishes from those who remembered me today made me to write yet another tale inspite of my days work. Ya All in a day's work is now becoming a part of my day's work. Everyone's wish is as unique as they are and so do they mean a lot to me as they are very personalised and carry hearty wishes. Ok then here is today's update! My beloved gave me a beautiful gold pendant which has a cute hanging pearl swinging and waving to all who look at my chain! Nice it looks ya. He also gave me a bouquet of roses and a beautiful card! I love them all very much.Morning before going to office i went to srini's place, I got blessings from him! Then he took me to Domlur Perumal temple and did Archanai. After breakfast he dropped me at my office. In the evening we all (my cousin sis and her family )are planning to go to srini's house and then for dinner. I am feeling so happy today. but your greets has really heightened my spirits! Sinoop called me yesterday evening & wished me. Then kavi also called me up. I got greetings from vinitha, ganesh and rajesh. Then ya, Rajesh, Ganesh and Manny called me up just few minutes back. It was nice talking to them. Ya one more thing to be noted here is , Manny could not attend my Betrothel because he had been to Pune for Kanbays software interview ( which i absolutely believe) and Ganesh could not attend coz, he had been to attend Microsoft interview at Silicon Valley and rajesh could not attend it as he had an interview at Singapore it seems. So i have asked the corresponding travel tickets for their proof! Krishnaaaaaaaaaa US and Singaporea kaapathu. Ok then will update all my events of later part of the day sometime later. Till then Cares and shares Ranjini

 A very happy birthday to Ranjini!! I wanted to send you a greeting card but I didn't know your address. Ok I thought I'll send you an e-card. But what to do, my system was being upgraded to Win2k. So I had no access to the Internet. All this was yesterday. I thought of going to a browsing centre to do the same. Alas, being a lazy guy had its privileges. On my way home, I ran into a couple of neighbours who wanted to play cricket. That's all, my plans of the going to an Internet cafe vanished like my last ball six into the nearby bushes. I thought well I have time till today morning. My system doesn't seem to like Win2k at all. It took an immediate dislike to the OS and started to restart (What an irony!). Well it is almost 3 in the afternoon when things have been going on smoothly between the OS and the system. So, here are my wishes to you, "You are always my friend; When I am happy or when I am sad, When I am along or when I am with people. You are always my friend, If I see you today Or if I see you a year from now, If I talk to you today Or if I talk to you a year from now. You are always my friend, And though through the years we will change, It does not matter what you do. Throughout our lifetime You are always my friend. " Bye, Jax. P.S. Ram &amp; Kicha , Get my treat also from Ranjini.

 Hi, 7 days back I was right. I expected this weekend to be different and so it was. As rini told, it was a refreshing morning walk and its been quite a while that I went to a temple as early as we went on that day. Thanks to rini I made it after a looong time. And yes... quite a few gossips about rini's and my life but the best of it was the big lecture she gave me on the flowers at the road-side and at the end of it all said "I know I'm boring u... but what will u do if ur girl has a curious taste and keeps pestering u by talking about that... so, take some practice" ... Might just be a question of time before I realise how true rini's words were... Spent the rest of saturday washing and snoozing... come sunday, and started early (again) to ramgopal's house to meet bala and by afternoon we had met Kavitha who's settled with a PG accomodation in BTM layout, not far from my house. Then we walked and walked and walked and drank pepsi and walked and drank pepsi and in between had Kavitha's treat and walked until we settled down in a park for an hour or so... then Kavitha left and we 3 walked and walked and drank pepsi and walked... and then I went home and slept and now I have a severe headache... I already filled up my stomach with some hot doses of coffee... still I need a good night's sleep today to get back to my usual self. Kicha

 Hi guys, here is my weekend tale! Yes this saturday, i dint do anything special except for getting tired of seeing Lord of Rings Twin tower. I felt sleepy at the end of first CD itself. So dint watch the rest of the movie. Morning i met kicha and had a nice time with him walking along 80 ft. road and enjoying, the morning sun and trees fully loaded with summer flowers with gossips about the happenings of kicha's and my life! Then he waved off and i trodded to srini's place. Ya i forgot to tell u guys, i did add two more members to my pretty fresh and frolic flowers family. One more rose this time. No not yellow, not red. Its a different pink. Then one more omam plant which is a medicinal herb. Wish them to grow well. Hei that yellow bud of which i was talking, it has grown, but not so beautifully. I wish it was beautiful, like the first offset. But nay it dint grow as good as that. No probs, it is yet to give me so many beautiful blossoms! So i will wait for those moments. Then i got back to hostel in the evening and washed a load of clothes and retired to bed early. Next day as usual we went early in the morning to take a fresh view of Lord Krishna and Radhe at ISKCON. Wow so fresh in pink, just the same color of the rose which i had bought yesterday! Then came back home and did prayer and then i went to my cousin brother's place. Srini went to his friend's place and promised to join me in the evening at my brother's place. We had a great time chatting and bulling each other! So did my weekend go. And yes guys, i am now been offered more responsibility than before and we are to accomplish our targets. So i wont be updating blogs as frequently as i do now with big tales. Bye for now from Ranjini

 Hi friends, More of musical wave on our blog. Nice to listen. Hei ram, i tried to download that hotbar, but i couldnot coz i dont have rights. So couldnot enjoy using it. And ya i dint tell u people right, i got a call from Sinoop yesterday after a long time. He wanted to hear my voice and to check if i am still at bangalore. So he called me up it seems. How funny. Then to my surprise, i caught rajesh online. I was logged on to msgr from my friend's system and so could not chat. So asked him to send mails and had a nice time with him for a while with relay of emails. Then in the evening, Rajesh and Ganesh called me up and we had a nice conference over phone and it was nice sharing some fun with them. Those two fellows, keeping me online, started fighting over phone about who is the hard worker. It was nice to learn that Ganesh is working hard starting from the near by park in the morning and ending at Valluvar kottam in the afternoon and then in the evenings at each tea stall, coz his uncle would shout at him if he comes back soon before 9 o clock. And rajesh toh, is rated at the best hardworker with his scedule from morning to evening at his bed in his room. So will all the fun, the conversation ended and so do my mail. Ok then guys, now off for the weekend. Cares and shares Ranjini

 Hi, "When the eyes start to listen the ears begin to see" ... Yup... ramg is right... western (MJ and Shakira likes) are entirely different from yesudass etc of India... but there r others also ... Elton John, Beatles, Bryan Adams and the young ones like Charlotte Church - these people are to western what yesudass is to Indian. I still can't forget the song "Voice of an angel" by Charlotte Church.. really her voice is like an angel's... but I couldn't get that song after that anywhere... (jax, note down...) Kicha

 Hi Buddies.... fine, and very happy today... Rini, myself also wants to go to concert etc... But it becomes unfeasible most of the times... my Grandpa used to go for every Concerts, he can.... at times I have also joined him during my school days.. yeah, jax, when u say music (western & classical) can be one and the same... but when u say song.....(western.... Michael Jackson, Shakira..etc...) r entirely different from Indians (yesudas etc....) yesterday I saw a superb fantastic classical musical film (only 2 CD's till. one more CD I have to see today...) all r waiting for the name... know... Its 20th century fox production "The sound of Music" superb yeah.. ultimate story, well designed... "Rodgers & Hammerstein...." Hope Jax would have seen it earlier... By way have a look at this site... Fantastic one...., "www.hotbar.com"... nothing more, update u later... bye take care... Ram

 Hi everyone, Atleast Ranjini got a chance to go to a music concert, that too a classical music concert.Here I am at Coimbatore longing for a chance to listen to any music, while at Bangalore, Ranjini is having a whale of a time in music. It is good to see that classical music is being appreciated by people still. But the following I think has dwindled over the years. You don't find people arriving in droves to classical music concerts. I understand that young people nowadays find it very hard to relate to classical music, whether it is Indian or western. I am at times tearing my hair in frustration about the terms used in the music. Those alaapanas, keerthanas in Indian music, the adagios, the da capos in western classical music make my head spin at times. Somehow Indian classical music has been brought to the common people by the movies. People can now realize that a song is in Bhairavi or kalyani ragam. But modern film music has become unhearable. Personnaly I feel that about 10 or 12 good songs are released every year out of a possible 500-600 film songs. Ignorant people may say that this is mainly due to western influence. That is total crap. Anyone who knows his keerthanas from the alaapanas will disagree. Western Classical music has been a great inspiration to many of our modern musicians. Notice I say Western Classical&nbsp; music, not westernised music. The modern music has no connection with the original classical music per se. Music as everyone will agree has no languages or boundaries. If you are able to listen and appreciate music, you will be able to listen and appreciate music in its various forms, whether it is in sanskrit, urdu or swahili. I think I have been talking a lot about music. I love music.period. Coming to my weekend, It is too early I know but what else to do. Thursday : Evening: Got to go to the church. Today is Maundy Thursday or Holy Thursday. For Christianity, the next three days form the crux of the religion. The coming Thursday, Friday &amp; Saturday are called as "Triduum" meaning the three great days. I will be again back at the church for a prayer late night. Friday : Good Friday . Will be on leave. Have to go to the church around 11 am. Saturday: My leave has not been sanctioned. So will have to come to office on Saturday. I am planning to ask for half a day's leave. Evening: Got to go to the church in the evening and again later at midnight for Easter Mass. Sunday : Easter Sunday . Morning mass @10 am. Heavy lunch at home. Visit friends and relatives. &nbsp; &nbsp; These are my expected lines for the weekend. See you on Saturday morn or Monday morn, Jax.

 Hi, So, thats the end of BizTalk Server training for me. Now, back to my routine work. rini, so nice to hear u enjoyed in the concert. Just stacked beside me are 8 boxes containing new Black DELL computers for the 4 people in our cubicle. The systems are 40GB HDD with 512MB RAM... good, ain't it... and the much awaited financial results of Wipro has come...They have registered a drop of 6% in their net-profit... Kicha

 What to tell about the concert! Hei have you tasted Lord Rama? Ya u would have , had u come to the concert, on hearing the most beautiful song on Rama. It was quite a different experience for me. I could imagine u guys wondering about what this friend of urs is talking about! Hei guys, it was an excellent evening for me yesterday. Can u believe i went to attend Nithyashree's Carnatic Music concert which was held on the occasion of Rama Navami. Wow i cant believe it. Till yesterday morning i dint think i will go. coz kicha had sent me the schedule earlier and so though i was interested, i thought i wont be able to go coz srini wont get time to accompany me. All the time, yesterday morning i was thinking, 16th falls on friday and so srini will have leave and will take me for sure to nithya's concert . But oh what a pity it was wednesday yesterday. And i was like totally in an abyss of sorrow. But in the afternoon, i was so driven that i decided to go to concert even if srini doesnt come coz one of my colleague's house is very near to the place of concert and she said she will accompany me too inspite of taking me to that place. wow i decided to go for it and planned well. Well planned we set out for the concert. Reached the venue, Got tickets and went inside! So many things were like new, odd and different. First thing was the punctuality. At the stroke of 6.30(the time at which the concert is supposed to start), the concert started and we dint have any kind of hassles in getting seated also. no push wush and not any kind of indecent people around, so calm, so matured were everyone. I felt they had come fully prepared to enjoy the concert with a poise and serene mind. So no hungama which I am seeing for the first time. Even applause were musical u know. Not too jarring but properly admiring the work of the artiste. Overall I liked it. The saddest part is I could not enjoy it full. The concert went till 9.30 but i had to leave at 8 as it will take atleast an hour or so to reach my place and i have to be inside hostel at any cost before 9. Even shobha (my colleague) who accompanied me for name sake was carried over by the atmosphere and "Oh rama nee naama entha ruchi" song! Ok back to the concert! I could listen to 6 songs with aalapanas and thani avarthanams in between. Those who dont know much about grammar of CMusic, never mind these terms coz i too am not good at explaining what those mean!. No wonder I wasn't able to see Nithya from my place though we had bought costliest ticket. Coz we went just before the concert started, we dint get seats near by but it was not visibility but audibility which mattered a lot and it was quite audible. One difference I could make out was, in cassette, the voice of the artist dominates and not the instruments, but yesterday I could see the mridangam artist was overpowering or I don't know how to tell. I mean her voice sounded feeble in front of that instrumental sound. So that alone I was not able to digest. Even other instrumentalists were coping well but not that mridangam. May be becoz I am hearing it for the first time it might have sounded so too. Actually that's y I think, I dint feel the same as what I had heard it in cassette, while hearing live that "Swagatam Krishna " song, my most favourite of all. Oh how I wished she sang "Evarura ninnu veena" song, another song on Lord Rama, a beautiful composition by Thiagaraja and our(mine and srini's) favourite. But to my dismay she dint till I left. how sad! But she started with one of my favourite "Ekambresa naayike" song. I was carried away with that song itself. First song and one of my favourite ,in such a mellifluous voice. No guys u need to experience that rather than trying to catch the essence in words. Then she came up with some more songs in Telugu. Though they were good, due to language barrier i could not enjoy much. And i was loosening my focus. And i was waiting when she will sing my favourite with an anxiety coz i never knew if she would sing or not. but then when my interest was slowly fading, she came up with Swagatham krishna song. Oops enna voice! How nice it was! Wow song after song, she was improving and so were the audiences straightening their bends and preparing themselves to enjoy the forthcoming delights. when the song was over, we could see Lord kirshna rejoicing his welcome like anything! Then came another telugu/kanada/sanskit song. Again other language song. Which was also i could enjoy a bit coz of same language barrier. But by the time it was 7.45. I dint feel like going. And waited for one more song. And my wait was worthwhile and so was my visit to the concert! It was a master piece. Yes , It was a beautiful song on Lord Rama! It goes like "Oh rama nee naama entha ruchi, emi ruchi" meaning how sweet and tasty your name sounds............. Wow classic ! Now got what i had meant in my first lines of this blog page? Ya mouth watering and tasty concert! Then it was 8 and i have to depart the place with full of music. My god, great is this music.One more thing was though I dint understand the language or the song, still it was good!! Oops another small piece, its ok guys, hope u will enjoy this too! Cares and shares Ranjini

 ohiiiiiiiiiiiyaaaaaaahhhhhhhh, small piece is this long means..... wow...... I couldnt even imagine how long the entire epic will be.... hope it will take years for you to write.... anyway tnx, Rini, I came to know different varieties of flowers. Ram

 Hei guys , i got the snaps which i had taken at hostel and at my workplace and with srini at his place and the ya at so many other places. Nice they are. It will take time for me to scan them and post to u people. So wait for some more time to have a look at those ok. Hei i have taken snaps of srini too in dhoti. Its all looking so good. And ya i went to ISKCON yesterday as planned and had a nice darshan of Krishna and radhe, though it was too crowded over there. Then hurried back home and on the way gave the sweets sent by mom to srini's cousin as srini hadnt returned from office. Hei he is working now late hours to finish his project and so we are not meeting daily as we used to before. How sad! Anyway i do have other works to be done as my cousin sis and her family had turned up. I think i had told kicha and ramgopal that i have kept some flowering plants at Srini's place. For jax, here is the list of plants i have. One red rose, one yellow rose, one white chrysanthemum, one red chrysanthemum, one pink bougainvilla, one blue jacaranda(a creeper which showers off flowers like anything during its flowering season), One beautiful red hibiscus, two red button roses, two lavender(ornamental plants), one juniper(another ornamental plant) and one marigold which shed off fully as its season was over few days back but fully flowered with its golden flowers before shedding completely. Hmmmmmm almost a dozen pots or so. All plants used to grow well and give flowers to enchant us every now and then but not those two roses which were my darlings. But yellow rose, my most favourite hasnt given even a single bud till now, nor has the red one, srini's favourite. But you know yesterday it has given a bud it sems. woweeeeeeeeeee ........ Cant u guys see me jumping............ Ya i was totally filled with joy and merrying in my office when he told me this news over phone yesterday. Good na. After almost say 6 months this is the first bud i am encountering. When i bought them i always had a fear that after the buds it had when we bought , the chances for the plants to survive will be very less and so were the plants behaving. I was feeling so sad and when ever i used to water them, usually on saturdays and sundays, i used to feel so bitter about them. coz i was so upset looking at a plant which pressed my heart coz it was not flowering. Actually there were one buds each in both plants when we bought and they bloomed in a weeks time and then withered away. But then they never came back again with another one when i was eagerly waiting for that delight. But now....... the wait is over. Wish i had a camera to preserve it blossom. I will take one full role on it. How desparately i would have waited for it u know. And thats what is making me to write such a big blog page. Sorry if i have bored u with all those words. Hope i havent coz i know its a small piece of sharing my sweet joy with u my dear friends! Bye for the day Cares and shares Ranjini

Had a short chat with kavi in the morning as she was rushing into the hall for her 2nd day and I was moving rather sedately (as I always do...) to my training lab...

 Bon jour mes amis, So, Rini has started on the greatest adventure - house hunting. You can learn a lot of things when you go on a search for a house. You find that there are things which you have taken for granted in the past are now hard to come by. The most interesting thing about house hunting is meeting people, all types of people (interesting and dull). Ranjini, visit these links for info: urlLink http://www.onlinebangalore.com/hous/reupdate/thumbrul.html urlLink http://www.koramangala.com/korabuz/rentals.htm One week left for your birthday and diid you get my points on your comments? Yesterday was a holiday, one of the 9 official holidays in my company. Here is my weekend. Sat : just working - evening choir practice Sun : Every year, we have a "samapandhi" at our church (Sunday preceding Easter). WE used to help in setting up of the tables and chairs and serve food, first to the poor and after that to other people in the church. This is not like the annadhanam given in temples, but more of a communal lunch. Had a good time. Got tired by the time I sat down for lunch. As one of the member in the 'serving' committee, got a lt of vadais than others. Went back home at 3 pm. and watched the Ind-SA match. Around 6 pm, went to leave my suister at Namakkal, The buses I got into were one of the slowest of the lot. Finally reached Namakkal at 10:30. Went to my uncle's house. After dinner, watched the highlights of the Brazilian Grand Prix. It was interesting to watch people just crash out. Luckily no one got hurt. Mon : Tamil New Year day - Got up early, got ready to leave to Coimbatore. I usually don't have breakfast on holidays. Did the same and later realized what a fool I was. Got down at Erode for breakfast. On checking my pockets, found that I had practically no money other than for the bus ticket. After rummaging through my pockets,&nbsp; found that I had over 30 Rs. of change alone. Had a orange juice and bought an Aquafina and got into the bus. My sister had told me about this bus. very fast and no stopping on the way. Got into the front row seat, just behind the gear shaft. Wonderful view of the road. made it to Coimbatore in no time. Coming home, found my house locked. After some time, my brother came. Took rest the entire evening playing Age of Empires. Also watched "Raiders of the Lost Ark" - interesting film. Tue : back at office - reading three day's mails and&nbsp; -- typing this... Ciao, Jax. BTW: anybody seen Saddam Hussein and his Weapns of Mass Destruction?? If yes, please inforn Bush and Blair. poor guys, been searching for him for the past one month.

 Dear Friends, s ofcourse, me tooo go with kicha's view.... if you c & watch carefully, kicha's views are pretty very much clear like crystal... from the way of expression right now we use in our mails and blogs, and the mode of conveying ideas/frustrations during difficult situations thru mails and speech.... Yeah, coming to my weekend, thought of washing on sat and sun to office... But... I slept very well in saturday that I postponed washing for sunday early morning.... But Saturday myself and uncle went for purchase... had a very gr8 deal of purchase at commercial... Sunday slept rather less than saturday... but too its late for my office.. So I cancelled my weekend visit to office... and washed, cleaned our house for the vishu....got fruits etc.. kept infront of deepam... today morning got up by 5.55 am... had a nice dharshan at Ayappa, Rama, Ganesha & Murugan temple... Finally finishing pooja at home and blessings from uncle, Went to Cousins home and showered blessing for my neice.... Back to office.. and had some work... now a little bit free... Cheers Ram

 Hi friends, Fine na. This weekend, i took a step into an all time adventure. Ya i did a bit of cooking. Ofcourse nor did i do it fully. We went to ISKCON on suday and then to one of Srini's friends place. There his friend and we felt it would be better if we could cook and eat. So i too got into the field with full josh, though landed up peeling and cutting onions with my eyes and nose watering.. We prepared tomato rice I dont know exactly the frying and mixing in proper proportion part, so i restrained myself from doing the same. Else it would have been a plate of relatives of charcoal when all people come to quench their hunger. But then as his friend's wife was there and though she is not an expert, she did manage well and it was a nice experience for me too. The taste was ofcourse good my dear friends and ya it also gave me confidence that soon i will learn to cook well! Hei growing more responsible than before right! So i do accept kicha's views. The day before we were on house hunt in Koramangala area in scorching sun, though it turned out to be a beautiful evening coz od the climate change.We dint get any accomodations of our likes and hopes and so returned empty handed. Hei guys at bangalore, u can help me out in these i beleve, Ya if u people come across any houses in Koramangala with rent The house if its a new one then its perfered. Hei jax i will mail u about ur reply mail. And ya i think i might go to those bookshops and i had been recently just a week before Had u told me before i would have gathered info by now. But never mind, i will let u know when i go there. But its not for sure in near future. i mean i will go by next month only. Will u wait till then or is it urgent. And if u tell me any particular audio book then i can enquire about that book exactly. Ya lets welcome kavi to join in our blog! Hei guys i dint tell u na, that i bought a new dress at last for my birthday. Ya i was like feeling i will forget my bday, coz of therate at which i was interested in it. But then i landed up buying a short top in some green color. Will get the dress today afteralteration and let you people know tomorrow how it looks. "Iniya Tamil Puthaandu nal vaalthukkal" Have a great time Till then Cares and shares Ranjini

 Hi, Am back from home. First a BIG sorry to jax for not calling him... in fact, I couldn't call anybody this weekend. Got a bit tied-up with some resposibilities. Interesting to watch the twists and turns of life, just a few months ago we were lads and now of all, we r men and women... I got a first-hand feel of what it feels to be a responsible "man" and an indication of sorts of how things are going to be in a few years from now. Long Live Life ...!!!! Expecting call from Kavi. She might be here by now and into the training hall. Just learnt that their training is going to be in UNIX to start with... yeah jax, may be u can again send the link to the groups and may be they can have a look at what has been going on and people who are online for a reasonable part of the day can be welcome to be part of us. Kicha

 Bon Jour , Finally, I am able to view the blog page once again. Found out a easy way to post to the blog, "Remote editing".&nbsp; Just trying the feature out. This feature will allow you to edit posted messages directly from the blog. No need to visit blogger.com. This is very useful , if you find you had made some typo or not linked an url. Ranj, did you receive my reply about your comments on the story? Ram, what happened to Manny? I feel that we should promote the blog more. Anyway, Kavitha would be joining us. If any of our friends are on the net most of their time, we can ask them to join also. your thoughts?? I wanted to put a message to the group about this, but first wanted to know your thoughts on the matter. BTW, if any of you visit a big bookshop like higginbothams or landmark, please ask if they have audio books for sale. Audio books are books recorded as audio cassettes or audio cds, sometimes even as mp3s. If they have any, could you inform me about the average prices? Just hoping this weekend goes as per expected lines. Bye, Jax.

 Hi, Yesterday was an interesting day. It went on as interestingly as it started. Infy's results were announced. Even though it had achieved company projections... the market analysts expectation was not reached. Furthermore, the forecast for next year that infy gave was 12-14% while the market expected it to be around 20-25%... and the resultant... market shattered... infy lost more than 1000 bucks in a single day, ie., over 25% lost... and ended at Rs. 3049 for ramgopal's query, Hughes s/w lost over 11% and ended at Rs.179 Not just that... almost every tech company lost more then 10-15% and Mastek led the way by losing 49% and ended at Rs.285 yesterday that was the talk of everyone... now I really understand the worth of our MS(IT&M) course. Even though all around me were discussing shares and businesses I was atleast able to figure out what all the fuss was about and could chip in with some sensible inputs to them. I usually keep a slender track of the markets ever since the day I started reading BusinessWorld (to be more precise, from March 2002). Now my interest is only increasing... and am going home today. heard that vijay babu is coming to mdu to collect his cert. Hope to meet him. and jax, will call u saturday night or sunday morning... and be back here on monday morning... Kicha

 Hi Ram, If it was placed under fire-wall, I would have received a custom message. No I get the message "Connection Failed . No route to host" found. I have to log into blogger.com and see the messages like I am doing right now. Trying to figure a way past this error. Bye, Jax.

 Hi jax, for me its not a prblm. By way I have selected all the notification but in Mozilla nothing works for me... Regarding blog page for u... might coz of ur regular usage "angleritech" IT dept. may have placed the same under a firewalll... nothing more, sterday had a presentation on Direcway wireless... www.direcway.com....Have a look at it... bye for now, catch u all later, Ram

 Hi all, I think there is some problem. I am unable to access the blog page. I keep getting errors. How about you? Bye, Jax.

 Hi friends, Yesterday, had nothing to do except sit around waiting for something or someone to call me. Nothing turned up. My sister wanted to watch a movie. So while waiting for dinner, I went out to the video shop. On the way back, bought a Digit magazine (100 Rs. gone down the drain). Watched "Manasellam". Ordinary story with illness, flashback. Tamil cinema has nowadays become very predictable. I can predict the start of a song, a fight sequence, or why even the next dialogue to a second (maybe plus or minute a couple of milliseconds). One thing I liked about this movie was its ending, albeit on expected lines, something that I have always believed in. Over the past couple of years, these type of climaxes have become commonplace. Trisha was more or less a leaner Jothika (same voice dubbing, gestures and body language). Srikant, better than previous films, but same old beard style. Most of the film, he seems to be wearing the same dresses. Our stunt master have gotten over the Matrix effect. The slo-mo and the instant action scenes have now become irritating. Ranjini, what happened to Hariharan? Forgot him? I have almost stopped listening to music. My cassette player has gone kaput. I don't get CDs (expensive). Most of all, no time at all to listen to music. At work, not much of music aficionados here. At times, can hear a few English songs wafting in the air. As I am composing this, Richard Marx's version of urlLink "I can't help falling in love with you" was running in one of the multimedia systems.&nbsp; Elvis Presley had originally sung this song. With his wonderful voice, it brought to mind emotions of beaches and walking along it with your loved one. One of my favourite songs, this song has appeared in the movie "Speed 2: Cruise Control". That song was by a British pop group, UB40. Now, the original version of Alaipayuthey has taken over the air, not the song in the movie, but the original version by..... I don't know who. Bye, Jax.

 Infy Quarter 4 results are announced... 259 crores net profit in 4th quarter � last year the fig was 210 crores� 3rd quarter it was 256 crores� Year-wise: 2003 : Net profit � 957.93 crores 2002: Net profit � 807.96 crores Growth rate of 18.56% Kicha

 Hi, Today, the morning was different. I stepped out of my bed amidst the darkness (there was no current) into the meeting room where I usually have a meeting every morning to answer all the questions posed by nature, only to find that the tap blew out air - No water in the tank...and no current to switch on the motor. I had to forcefully postpone my meeting with nature. It was not until 7AM that the current came and then rushed in to meet and went on to successfully answer all of nature's questions as I do everyday and made here some 30 mins later than usual... rini venturing into Greek stories... I'm not patient enough to read stories... but very patient enough to listen if somebody is patient enough to tell it out... Today is April 10th... and by late afternoon, Infy's 2002-03 4th quarter results will be out... anxious to learn how we've fared in this not-so-good economic climate... Kicha

 Hi friends, Yesterday as i was free i happened to read whole of "Perseus the Deliverer". the story of which i have already published before. It was a classic piece. Especially the Character of Cassiopea who is the queen of Syria and mother of Iolaus(friend of perseus) and andromeda (lady love of perseus) is one of the best portrayed character in the play. U should see the dialogues delivered by her when she finds that her golden stressed iolaus is going to be slained..... She becomes so fierce and with the will and inteligence of a queen and heart of a mother, she stands for her son. Ok i cant just like that express what i have relished in mere words. So let me stop with this. Hei i did buy one casette yesterday too. Its called Sarvasri by Balamurali krishna. I listened to it when i went to bed. Wow so soothing is the music on Lord Ganesha. But will be very good to listen as the day starter as Ganesha is the beginner of all deeds! Oh, but the pitiable part is the quality of casette is not good and i need to exchange it for a new one. Inspite of that i enjoyed listening to the music. This is the first time i am listening to his voice. Its also good. We bought two more casettes by Sanjay Subramaniam whose musical voice we both enjoy like anything. one is Kalyani and the other is Ashwaththa i believe. Once Srini has had the delight of listening, i am planning to relish too. Till then got to wait! Ok guys see u later. Cares and shares Ranjini

 Hi Jax, Thanks I have done so... and also have asked manny to do the same... Whether its necessary one of the Mozilla's window should be kept open for this alert... Anyway I have quick launcher at my desktop Nothing more bye yeah.... blog page is looking good.. Can u place the boquet I inserted in the blog near the members pane bye RamG

 Dear Ram, Friday is too soon. I was expecting it to be ready by Monday. Then the only option is let Manny prepare a rough draft of the paper. Ask him to mail it to my personal id. I'll go through, make necessary corrections, changes etc and mail it back to him. For your mozilla query, open urlLink the blog in Mozilla and bookmark it. Then go the B ookmarks menu and click on M anage B ookmarks... Right click on the newly created bookmark and click on P roperties. Go to the S chedule tab and set it according to your preferences. The N otify tab can be used to alert you whenever the page has been modified.&nbsp; Though this feature is very useful, it gets a little annoying at times, whenever an alert pops up. Everyone, check out the new Members link at the left hand side. Your comments and suggestion for utliizing the space effectively are welcome.&nbsp; The small subscription box on the right is for those who want to receive updates made to the blog through email. If anyone, say Ganesh, wants to know whether there are any new posts to the blog, he can subscribe using the form. He will then be receiving mails about the updates to the blog through emails. As I had mentioned earlier, please use the &lt;br&gt; tag to seperate sentences. As you all can see all the posts appear as a single para. Use the HTML knowledge we learnt at MS(IT&amp;M) atleast now. Bye, Jax.

 Hi Jax, Thanks a lot for your reply, By way here is a pdf "http://www.cs.unc.edu/~stotts/COMP144/lectures/lect24.pdf" u can download the same, Here is one more link "http://www.desy.de/gna/html/cc/Tutorial/node7.html" u can have some more info... and this is the final good link I got in a random search in google yesterday "http://docs.eiffel.com/general/guided_tour/language/invitation-12.html"... If u r preparing do at the earliest since friday is the last date I think so... Coming to my OS its Win NT 4.0 Workstation, Mozilla...1.3 version... nothing more, expecting your blog... Ram kicha, the name is for your campus..or for the MUseum of computing... kicha, by the way some of the links in Museum are obsolete... And all... I went into the following site do check it has history related to ancient computing... http://www.columbia.edu/~rh120/ch106.x09 in place of 09 u can use other chapter nos....

 Hi, Came across an interesting site - an online urlLink museum of computing... check that out... if possible, send me some names of famous personalities associated with computing...not the CEOs of current big companies but some people who have a historical importance with computing... here, there is a tradition of naming conferance halls after such names... they want to name 2 new conferance halls of our floor and r asking for some suggestions... Kicha

 Dear Ram, Regarding your query for Manny, I would like to have some info before proceeding. What the hell is dynamic binding and how is it related to C, C++, and Java. I am not that much technically sound. Maybe if you or manny could help me by suggesting a few pointers (not the one in C &amp; C++) on the topic, maybe some sites where you can get information. Since I need some time to prepare it, it would be really helpful if you or Manny collect just the rough information and mail me (to my personal id). I'll try my best. Don't reply to my office. Any urgent message, blog it, I'll read it and reply asap. Kicha, the answer to your question " The man was a very short man. He could reach only upto the button for fifth floor. On rainy days, he would be having his umbrella. Using it, he can press the button for the tenth floor." I feel that we can use the blog for these type of interactions instead of mailing. We have got the technology, so I feel that we should make use of it more often. Ram: Sorry for not replying earlier to your query, which version of mozilla did you download? I know you are using Win2k OS. Bye, Jax.

 Neither of the two u mentioned, jax... she's being cruel by not readying herself to give treat to her friends... ain't not giving treat for b'day a cruel thing... Kicha

 Hi all, I think that the problem is that the line breaks were not converted into &lt;br&gt; tags. I feel the best option is to insert the line breaks manually. So as you have got admin rights, you can edit your posts and insert the tags manually. If it is a problem from Blogger's end, then we will have to wait for them to rectify it. Ranjini, I guess you have taken to reading a lot nowadays. Why, having a lot of free time? As you had said, the Greek mythology is one of the most interesting and also the most intriguing mythologies. No offense meant, but I feel that that it is better than the Indian ones. The entire greek mythology is available online. Bartleby is a very good source. Personally I really love the Odyssey by Homer the most. BTW what was Kicha meaning by Ranjini being cruel to her friends. What is Ranjini going home to Madurai or spending the entire day with Srini, which of these two scenarios will it be? To view images, it is important the image be referenced by an url, a file path would not suffice. That's all folks, bye, Jax.

 Hi, Times are turning better for our people, I guess. Kavitha getting into infy, jax getting a hike... and we cud expect more to come... but dunno whats happening with vinod... now, should we believe him or not.... Its nice thing that Kavitha is reporting in Bangalore... so soon our blog and mailing people's number will rise to 1 more... but its a pity that kavi will not be able to meet ranjini (or should I say, ranjini will not be able to meet kavi - or anyone for that matter) ---not even for her b'day treat...thats very sad.... ain' it... how can ranjini be so cruel to her friends... Kicha

 Hi friends, Ranjini had mailed me about blogger scrolling. Sorry i had nothing to do with it. Will try and see if anything can be done to rectify this. It might be a problem at blogger's end. Also as blogger is providing a free hosting space in its domain, we are allotted only one page space. That's why we are not allowed the facility of uploading images, Ranjini. If we require the option of uploading images onto the blog, we have buy some space. For more information, read the FAQ. Rini, your cooments on the story are appreciated. I'll mail you later about them. I had just come in when I recieved your mail. BTW, I got an increment of 1K yesterday. Bye, Jax.

 Hi friends, i like stories esp. greek ones as they are full of fantasy and their names are different and at the same time beautiful. To name few, i came across some names like andromeda, poseidon, perseus, cireas, athene, danae, zeus, cassiophea, phineus and so many. Hei all these are names from a legend called "perseus". We could see that we are using these words like andromeda-name of a constellation and Athene - athens, poseidon - name of a building which i have come across somewhere in bangalore. When i encounter some words which are attractive and beautiful, i found it to be greek most of the times. Inspite of the people even greek names are also beautiful right! Yes they are quite attractive i beleive. Even those legends are quiet interesting to read u know. Do you want to read one where in i encountered all these names? come on walk with me, just a small paragraph ahead will tell u a nice story! ********************************************************************************************************************************************************************* ACRISIUS, the Argive king, warned by an oracle that his daughter�s son would be the agent of his death, hoped to escape his doom by shutting her up in a brazen tower. But Zeus, the King of Gods, descended into her prison in a shower of gold and Dana� bore to him a son named Perseus. Dana� and her child were exposed in a boat without sail or oar on the sea, but here too fate and the gods intervened and, guided by a divine protection, the boat bore her safely to the Island of Seriphos. There Dana� was received and honoured by the King. When perseus had grown to manhood the King, wishing to marry Dana�, decided to send him to his death and to that end ordered him to slay the Gorgon Medusa in the wild, unknown and snowy North and bring to him her head the sight of which turned men to stone. Perseus, aided by Athene, the goddess of Wisdom, who gave him the divine sword Herpe, winged shoes to bear him through the air, her shield or aegis and the cap of invisibility, succeeded in his quest after many adventures. In his returning he came to Syria and found Andromeda, daughter of Cepheus and Cassiopea, King and Queen of Syria, chained to the rocks by the people to be devoured by a sea-monster as an atonement for her mother�s impiety against the sea-god, Poseidon. Perseus slew the monster and rescued and wedded Andromeda. ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Hope u all enjoyed reading! the story of medusa, we had studied during our high school period. So it would have been a nice refresher i believe for those who had learnt it already. FYI Nike means "God of victory" in greek and Athene is "Goddess of Wisdom". Ok guys will see u later till then Cares and shares Ranjini

 Hai Xavier, Its nice to hear that Mozialla browser automatically checks for changes in the website for every configured time, I have downloaded the same and have installed... Can u plz. help me in doing these, and some more functionalities of the browser, It will be very helpfull... Hence I can save my brain & time in digging the nuances of the browser... Thanks RamG

 Dear all, Uploading images : You cannot insert images that are present in your hard disk or internal network. The image has to be online. I repeat it has to be a image that can be referenced as an url (i.e. www.somedomain.com/images/image.gif). If you find a image that you really like and want to share, right click on it to locate its location and insert that path as the source in the image tag. If you are accessing sites that require authentication, there are chances that the image might not get displayed in the blog. But you can check that out by copying the image's url and pasting it in the browser. If the image gets displayed, fine. If not, forget it. &nbsp; Editing blogs : All of you have been given admin rights by me. You can log in and check it. Please use this facility only when you have made some mistakes like wrong links or something like that. I am using it only to delete multiple blogs that you might have created by pressing post or publish twice. As I have made a facility to be updated by Mozilla every time the blog changes, I can immediately get the changes done. The blog gets checked by the browser every 15 minutes. More news and info later, Jax .

 Hi ram, Nice bouquet to start with! Good going man....... I will also give a try! btw jax how do i delete a published blog? And is it possible for anyone to view our blogs? Ya will get back to u with some nice interesting article some time later! Pink Lotus Ranjini

 Hai all, sorry there was a mistake in my earlier try, Hope this works... Cheers Ram

 Hi everyone, I found a way by which images can be posted. Remember, Images can be inserted only, not uploaded. To insert images into the blog post, you need to know a little bit of basic HTML. Say, I want to insert a image into the post say a Blogger logo. All I have to do is write the post as a HTML code. -------- &lt;p&gt; This is a &lt;b&gt;sample test post&gt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; This shows how you can insert images into the post&lt;br&gt; &lt;img src="aaa" width="xxx" height="yyy"&gt; eg. Note: 'aaa'=source image, the actual path of the image. You can find this out by rightclicking the image you want to be posted to the blog. 'xxx'=the width of the image to be displayed. 'yyy'=the height of the image to be displayed. -------------------------- Try it out... Bye, Jax.

 hi all, My weekend, (sat @ office) as u all are aware off... Sunday with kicha....Hope by this time kicha might have agreed... that "SITUATION DRIVES PEOPLE'S ACTIVITIES" Ok, no more comments on this... Coming to Ganja's bloging... Ofcourse u r right Jax (if upload of snaps is allowed, might be All in a day's work would have become "Every inches in JOO's shooting"...) Ok let me also try to follow the new rules Jax has posted for Ganesh... nothing more, Yet to start my todays activities... Catch u later, Ram

 Hi everyone, Ranjini seems to be making efficient use of the blog. Good going, keep it up. Ranjini, another thing, if you come across any interesting websites or articles on the web, just blog it. Just like the article of the week that you had been sending.&nbsp; Kicha, what a co-incidence, I saw "Lord of the Rings - Two Towers" on CD for the second time Saturday night. I wanted to watch it in a theatre. But they took the movie off from the theatre this Friday. Ram and Kicha, don't get left behind. Keep blogging. Last week, when there was a flurry of mails being sent to the groups, Ganesh had spoken to me. He did not believe that this blog was actually ours. He thought that we had ^C and ^V'ed the entries from somewhere. He said that only when he had noticewd the names at the bottom, he believed that it was us. He said that he also wanted to join. I had told him the rules: 1) Atleast more than two blogs in a week (one per day or more would be really great) 2) He would not be able to upload images( thank god, or else this blog would have become a photo gallery of Jothika). Your comments on the above matter expected??? My weekend went as per expected lines. Saturday evening singing practice, Sunday morning church, Sunday evening practice. The only thing different this week was that urlLink Cecilia Ohrwall &nbsp; had come to give us a few pointers on singing. The practice sessions were totally fun and interesting. Actually today (Monday), we will be giving a small performance in the evening. We will be singing three African songs. One song is titled "Ashikatale". You find the lyrics to this song urlLink here at the bottom of the page.One song is "Bele Mama". This song is a lively foot-tapping song. Another song is titled "Mwanga Ni Mwema". This song is in Swahili. Well, I forgot to tell you all something. If this small music group takes off, we might be coming over to Bangalore to give&nbsp; a small performance. A similar group located at Bangalore will be coming over to Coimbatore to give a performance. We might be reciprocating thier visit here. So expect in Bangalore sometime in the future, but definitely within the end of 2003. The second Gulf War is in its third week. Keeping a close watch on the developments, I found out several things. It is interesting to note that there are different versions of the same news, on by the western media and one by the eatern media. I get both versions though the western media is more prominient, CNN, BBC, NY Times... For the Iraqi version, you have urlLink Al-Jazeera only. Reading both versions gives one the thought that they are covering two different wars. On one, the Anglo-American forces all have but won the war. on the other, they are getting beaten black and blue. That's all for now, keep in touch, Jax. Note: As I may be experimenting with the look and feel of the blog, you might get some errors accessing it. Kindly adjust. I will give prior intimation if I plan to modify it.

 This weekend, I was not in the best of my spirits. I dunno why. But I was just not feeling like myself. Imagine what cud have been the reason for a guy who NEVER sleeps in the afternoons to sleep for 5 hours at-a-stretch between 2PM and 7PM on a saturday... I'm still trying to figure that out... Later that saturday night my house-mates called for "Lord of the rings" movie... Imagine what cud have been the reason for a guy who SELDOM prefers to go for night-show movies to go in for the movie that night... I'm still trying to figure that out ... nevertheless, the movie was good... and I hardly slept that night after coming back from the movie. Morning got up around 6AM (after returning from the movie well past 1PM and hardly getting any sleep).... started to ramgopal's house later in the morning ... saw "Lord of the rings" again in CD at his house... and in the evening went to shiva temple behind Kemp Fort before pulling up my bermudas for the night... so, wasn't the best of weekends... hope to have a more cheerful week ahead... and praying that my plans of going home this weekend doesn't get spoilt... Kicha

 Hey ram, thanx for complimenting me for having blogged more. And here is my weekend tale. This time sunday was verrrrrrrrry interesting. Usually we used to go to ISKCON only around 11 o clock and come back in scorching sun. But this time, Srini asked me, "Hei r u ready to come and see the first aarthi?" I said y not, with a faint idea of knowing that it was at morning 7.15. Then having decided, we planned to move accordingly. My god i was amazed at the krishna was! He was in pure red. If there had been anything which seems so pure to me in red color, it was his dress that day. We reached early morning 7.20 though we missed the first few moments all those moments which followed were so good.Early morning i was stunned by the beauty of krishna to the extent that one second, i thought the day is also stunned seeing krishna and so eveything is immobile for a second. But all those musical dance and merriful prayers on the lrod brought me back to conscious. One more thing happened so surprisingly. Daily i used to tell suprabhatam at hostel, but i wont be able to tell on sats and sundays. I always tried and due to my sluggish nature, and lazines of my body, i just used to sleep. But on sunday i properly pray together with srini. But anyway i used to miss my suprabhatam. But it so happened that infront of Srinivasa Govinda, they said Suprabhatham. I was totally carried away. Ah, those single bell sound after every four lines, and all of us chanting at same pace, nonstop in continuous breath, without anykind of background music, only those words which u have been telling for many days really rises something in u. Apart from this my weekend was good as usual with srini. Today is my brother's birthday and i rang up to him to wish him. I got him a camera and he liked it a lot it seems! Jax i havent yet started reading ur story, will pass on my comments once its done. Ok guys lots more when time permits Till then Cares and shares Ranjini

 Ofcourse I entered the blog site only today after a long gap.. Oh, the bloggings are pretty more, As like in work schedule Rini is blogging ahead among all of us.... ofcourse more than Xavier, My view... Then, S my job is slightly.. engaged....(self made) as and when a soln. is provided next one comes... If yet to be provided, I will take the next one..too.... Right now I am inserting legs in every things I can..... And ofcourse confident also that I can place my legs safely..... Anyway I am trying very little to place legs safely..... I have to really put efforts.. than just think that I can put... Nothing more, enjoying the weekend at the office, Bye, Catch u later, Cheers RamG

 Oh jax, though he has got me so many dresses, i never let him wait more than 5 mins. I have always been in time. So there is nothing to be asked about to him ok! Oh my i thought i would read ur story in the afternoon, but uuuuuuuuuuuuuu dont have? How sad? Ok i am now off to a meeting on Medical Insurance fron Oriental Insurance Co. Nice joke. UR wa of expressing leaves. I like it. By the way where is our ram? Not blogging now a days? verrrrrrrrrrry busy....... Hei what happened to the paraphrase i had asked for? Forgot that too and proving that u r really becoming senile? Hei guys did i tell u i am ahead of my schedule by two days. The thing is i was lagging behind by two days last week and now leading. Wow really geared up...... Hope all of u guys to have a nice weekend as i do. Btw jax u go for singing classes? I never knew about it? And what a pity u had a tough time for all night prayer! Ok then guys see u monday morning Cares and shares Ranjini

 Ranjini, I absolutely forgot that you are an engineer and that you had to wear uniforms. I guess I am getting a little senile nowadays. I keep forgetting simple things a lot. But I am astounded to hear that Srini has been buying you a lot of dresses. I have to talk to him about that. If he says that you always take a lot of time to get ready to go out somewhere, it is his mistake ;-). He buys you a lot of dresses and then he complains you take a lot of time to choose a dress and get ready. BTW I'll send my story this weekend. I don't have it at office. Kicha, where are the answers for the quiz that you had sent. I am eager to know the answers that the others had sent. Mail it soon. I guess you all have been enjoying a lot of holidays at your respective concerns. I have over 60 days off for me, 52 sundays + 10 cl. Poor me! Bye, Jax. visit urlLink this .

 Hei what, all u guys kidding me like anything........ This is not fair ok. I am used to wear pant shirts from the day i stepped in to my Engg. college, though i hadnt tried anything except uniform. But i think all u people must be knowing that i wear pant shirt once a week to my office too. I wear saree twice a week, chudi twice a week and pant shirt once a week. So this makes up my outfit for a week. And during weekend i always stick with Sarees on sunday as we go to temple and on sats based on the occasion i wear either Saree or Pant shirt and not chudi ok. coz he never likes chudidhars somehow. Ya regarding a snap of me in Pant shirt, yes i have taken a snap at my office in my official wear and if it turns out nice, then i will post it to u all guys. so kicha u need not strain ur little brain with all such things and scribble on to our blog. I will send u the snaps. And ya Srini does wear dhoti. Wonder?! Its his one of his favourite casual wear but only at home, coz unlike Madurai here none of the youngster wear dhoti and so i have restricted not to wear it outside. So apart from that, he looks majestic in the dark grey shirt with cool dark blue bootcut jean. I always prefer him in jean and so does he. He has a very good dressing sense and never lets me dress shabby as i used to do earlier. It should be a proper one, then only he will be satisfied, else i need to change. And so does he dresses too. He dresses both trendy and conventional. Both suits him properly, though i always prefer to see him in Dhoti. Infact i was the one, who got him dhoti at ISKCON. He has got me so many modern outfits, like 7 tops and 2 pants for me. But i have got him only one dhoti and one shirt till now. Planning to buy more in coming days. Hei people, i had bought a brand new Samsung camera for my elder brother karthick for his birthday and i have taken snaps using that only. So first trial, i dont know how its going to turn out. Let me wait and see. Till then u too guys should wait . I dint get fooled by ramgopal's first message. But the second one, the cursor play was so cute. I enjoyed it, though i had to log off to get back my cursor as my job involves working on black background and the cursor is in black color. Hei jax, send me ur story man without fail, i think today after noon i will b a bit free. So will read and pass u comments. Till then cares and shares Ranjini

 A new language has been developed by the Dept. of Computer Science, University of Durham, UK. Written by Edwin Brady and Chris Morris. This language is very user-friendly, doesn't contain a lot of syntax. Learn more about the language urlLink here. I guess Ramgopal can learn this program. Kicha may also find it useful for his programming. But the language may not be compatible witht the .Net platform. The only link between programs written in Whitespace and .Net is that the filename suffix are similar (.ws for Whitespace programs & .ws for Web Services written on .Net platform. Yesterday being April Fool's day, I don't know how many of you all got be a real fool. I came across this article while browsing. It gives the urlLink Top 100 April Fool's Day Hoaxes of All Time .

 Ranjini, wearing pants...???? going for movie....??????? me too like to see u in pant shirt and going to a movie... wait... i'm trying to imagine... am thinking.... hard... hard... really hard... oh...man... I give up... however hard I try... its impossible for me to think that way... is it Ranjini...??? I guess, thats how gals change on accomodating their "The Guy"... I wonder how seeni has changed after getting his "The Gal"... has he started wearing dhoties while going out... :-) (hee....heee.....heee.........) and ever wonder, if seeni spends so much time in choosing what dress he wears to meet his gal... or has Ranjini ever cribbed anything to her guy on what he's wearing that day... strange happenings.... just trying to use this as a case-study ... might be useful for me in the future... Hey Ram....!!! (no, i've not become pious... thats the song slicing its piece of melody thru my ears...) Kicha

 Ranjini, You in a pant shirt. Is this an April Fool's joke? I would like to see a photo. Can you arrange it? I guess you all must be using mostly Internet Explorer for your browsing. But there are alternatives to IE. I am not against Microsoft products. But after using urlLink Mozilla , I have become a fan of that browser. I wouldn't say that Mozilla is the best browser, but it has a few features that I really have come to like like tabbed browsing. Though Netscape is built using the Mozilla base, I feel that Netscape is resource hungry. Mozilla has some really wonderful tools to help in blogging. A few of my earlier posts were made through those tools. The irony is that I am composing this blog using IE, not Mozilla. In case you need any more information on Mozilla or any other browser, try urlLink googling! BTW, R.Sinduja's birthday is tomorrow. Right? Jax.

 For me, the weekend was as good as it used to be. We went to Domlur chokkanatha Perumal swamy temple on saturday morning and then Srini went to office as he had to.then i came home and had a nice little nap till i was awakened by a phone call ringing and some body yelling from a far away place "ranjini call for u". I went downstairs and picked my phone with a big yawn. In a disinteresting voice i said "Hello" and the other end it was Srini. I was surprised coz, srini said he would come back late. And calling me at 5 o clock? Then what, he said lets go for a movie and i said no way........ But what to do, will have to sacriifice all such small myths about theatres at least at this point of time na. So said ok. Ofcourse we were not sure if we would get ticket for Lord of Rings - II. He gave me just 15 mins to dress up and come out of the house and by that time he would catch a rick and wiat for me near by. So dint know what to wear, coz morning i had dressed up my violet saree in north indian style and so if i had to go for it then it would be late. So i voted for Pant shirt. I always like the cotton boot cut which he bought me first. Its in pale white color and he had bought me an orange top for that too. But that combination i wore on friday. So was getting bugged up wearing that again.Then what, i thought for a while and remembered that he had bought me a trendy cotton top with blue embroidery. So though i thought it wont go much with my white bottoms, i decided to pull it over. got ready soon and then rushed out. He was surprised to see me in that outfit and all these days i havent wore this top even once though he had bought me this top some 6 months back. I dint wear coz i dint have any proper bottoms for that. Really i felt it was looking good on me. Enough of my tales, and now back to movie. Oh we went to Symphony theater and u should see the crowd ........ aaaaaaah , as we both are lone hunter, we scurried from that place as early as possible and the show was house full. So to his dismay and my joy, we dint go for movie. Then we went to commercial and bought a nice chudi material for my sis and then came back home. So went saturday. On sunday we both after praying, went to ISKCON temple and as i had already told kicha, its become a routine for us to pray on sunday for a while and then go and have nice aarthi of Lord Krishna at ISKCON. Then came back home and i got back to hostel in the evening. So did my weekend go!

 Hi all, Machan jax add "Kalai Gjani Kamal Hassan" also in the bio da.it is nice but rectify it as kicha had told. Then saw "Parthiban kanavu" yesterday. as jax said sneha was stunning.nice movie with a clean story line. dai jax,vinod kannan,ajayan,bala also want to join the blog . do the needful. waiting for kavi's and manny's treat in chennai. atended written test for "Tech Pacific".wating for the result. i have a couple of interviews on monday,one for hutch & other for niit. hope to do well. machansi cannot send meaningful information like what u send bcoz i do not have the time to think & also browse. that's why iam sending information like these. bye tak care

 Hey jax, That was a neat trick to increase traffic to the groups...!!! But wonder, how the statistics gives Kicha's IP address and Sinduja's ISP and not Sinduja's IP address and Kicha's ISP...??? the bios are good, jax. But we can't point on our names (the link) and scroll up the page to view the bio at the same time... hope u handle this issue soon. I'm still wondering if I have to come on saturday too. My heart says NO but my mind says YES. No special plans yet for the weekend as am still not sure if its gonna be a 1-day or a 2-day weekend. And that new feauture that I'm bringing up for past 2 days, the "Ponder of the day" ... its turning out to be more informative. But I assure u, it wont be the case everytime. I've got a good list of a few things... which seems very trifle and stupid at first glance but have something to ponder about. More in the lines of Dilbert's Management quotes. until monday.... so..long..mates...

 Hi all, Was just checking the site statistics now. Noticed someone online now, I think it's Sinduja. Amazing what these statistics can give you. Like Kicha's IP address, Sinduja's ISP. Some got to this site from an iWay. And thanks to replying to the message sent to the group immediately.

 Hi, Valli,Hope you had a great weekend.It's nice to know about you eventhough we are thousands of miles apart.where is sindhu? Hope Rini is busy.. I am at the end of my training.I have been posted in chennai.I will be going to chennai on june 4th.I ahve to give my final exam on june 2nd and 3rd. I am going to work in .NET project for Reynolds&Reynolds..Automobile firm, mainly dealing with cars. Hope you all knew about my posting. Jax,it's a good idea to add Bio of everyone. Hope our blog will be more interesting in future with all your statistics. See you all.. Bye, Kavi

 About Bios : I've added a small bio for everyone. It is just for testing purposes. Not meant to hurt anyone or make fun. Please take it in the lighter vein. Site Meter : Also, I have added a site meter, which will count the no. of visitors to the blog yesterday. Going through the statistics for the past couple of days, found some interesting facts. I'll collect info for one week and then post it on the blog after collation. Kicha, You call them " tectonic activities ". Bye for now,

 B R E A K I N G N E W S . . . . Kavitha going to work in .NET in Chennai. and today's Ponder of the Day If mars had earthquakes would they be called marsquakes?

 Hi, jax, that was a good journey thru memory lane... something to feel nostalgic about... in fact, we should thank u first, for making us open to this exciting new world of blogging... (diplomatic exchanges apart) its really opened up new ways to explore the net and great platform for knowledge-sharing (and gossip-sharing :-) ). and as broken at 4:23:59 ... Kavitha will be moving to Chennai Development Center next week. That'll be the end of her short saga in Bangalore... she now goes where she really belonged... (atleast I feel so)... even though she had always asked me to pray that she gets posted to BLR, I told her "I'll pray surely, but that will not prevent them from posting you to Chennai"... and the rest is history.

 Breaking News... Kavitha posted to Chennai. Due to report there on June 4th.

 This entry is about the origin and design of this blog. All links will open in a new window. All in a day's work! - a colophon I learnt about blogs and blogging somewhere round the middle of February. I was searching for an article for my company's newsletter. I felt it was a wonderful idea. I liked the idea of publishing to the web in a jiffy. Searching around for blogging tools, I found that I could not get into LiveJournal without an invite, Movable Type seemed superb but required a website. So, I opted for Blogger. It was free and offered free hosting. This was my only rationale in choosing Blogger. When this blog was started in March, I never had an idea that it would be a wonderful and delightful experience. After playing with it for a couple of days, I thought it would be a wonderful idea if it could be used as a platform for various people to speak on common issues. I invited Kicha, Ram and Rini to join me. Our initial efforts were more like mails. Later on, we broadened our horizons to include all issues from personal angst to music. The initial design was simple and colourful. The template was designed by urlLink Andrew Hoshkiw . You can a sample urlLink here . Everyday brought a new fresh look and avenues for experimentation. I had tried out webcounters, subscription tools, commenting systems during the whole of March and a better part of April. April brought me a new road to explore, Cascading Style Sheets or CSS. Till now I had seen some wonderful websites and just wondered about how people were able to create such beautiful websites. And I work in a web design company. At work, I was used to more of a image based layouts where the design preceded content. It still does. People here were just experimenting with CSS. I then began having a good look at the designs that had attracted my attention. I noticed most of them using CSS. A Google search promptly led me to a wide range of resources on the matter. Thank God for Google. Then what, search led to information, information transferred itself to understanding and understanding became knowledge. By this time, we managed to pick up a few more people on the way like Rajesh, Ganesh, Sinduja, Kavitha, Valli and Vijay Babu. We had increased to ten. One more member (Sangeetha) is expected to join shortly at the time of writing. Late April saw the blog's design being changed. This time, the bright colours were now replaced by a sombre dark purple colour. I took the layout from urlLink wicked design . This template was based on a CSS Design. I modified this template to match the requirements of the blog. It also gave me a chance to test out the various CSS techniques I had learned. My God! What an experience that was, both interesting and strenuous. May brought the summer with its scorching sun. The blog was also getting heated up with lots of discussions and other things going on. There came a change in the blog design once more. I found a very good simple and elegant design at urlLink CSS Colouring Book . I have modified it to implement a lot of interesting concepts that I had learnt over the past couple of months. By the end of May, I learnt one thing, CSS. It is really a beautiful way of expressing design. The trouble is not all web browsers support it. There seems to be a clear divide on support. If Internet Explorer supports it, Netscape and Mozilla don't. If they do, IE won't. There seems to be no common ground at all. As I had explained earlier, I seem to be facing some very peculiar and unique faults. IE6 is supposed to support CSS. A few of the most common layouts like those designed by urlLink Eric Costello , urlLink Rob Chandanais , urlLink Eric Meyer , and urlLink Owen Briggs are not displayed correctly in my machine (WinMe/IE6). But they are displayed in all their glory at my office machine (Win98/IE5). Mozilla is supposed to display CSS correctly, but this blog's layout doesn't. I cannot comprehend. So, my quest for a good design continues just as this blog will. I would really have to thank my friends, a part of this blog, who had sat there, demure and uncomplaining when I played around with the blog. This concludes the first part of the colophon for this blog. I?ll add the remaining parts whenever I get the time.

 Kicha, what a co-incidence. I was thinking of asking the question this monday. but didn't get the time to do it. forgot about it by Tuesday morning. I read about it a couple of months back, but I don't remember the source right now. I had saved a few bookmarks now and then. Here is a couple of them. Read a short explanation urlLink here. Oracle (the database manufacturer) also suggests a few conventions urlLink here . Personally, I prefer the german style of abbreviativing number as nr, but due to easy understanding of others, it has to be written as no. Looking at it, no. also makes sense in the form of using etc. for et cetra. Regarding the bios, that's why I'm waiting for others to tell about the other members. OR we could put in a short note by everybody. It will take up a lot of space. Need everyone's help on the matter.

 Hi, Guess it might have been great 4-day off for Valli. I remember seeing such aquariums in Discovery Channel and National Geographic. jax, for the short-bio, it wud be better if someone else writes for others... that way its likely to make more interesting reading... and here's my Ponder of the day... Why is "number" abbreviated as "no"? When there is no "o" in number?

 After 4 great days...now again, left all alone with my computer.....On saturday, we hosted a party. Though not a formal one, i still had a lot of work that day. sunday, we spent our time shopping(just the usual grocery :-( nothing interesting!!) & bowling. There's a new Indian restaurant opened......we tried it out on sunday....the food was better than the other Indian restaurants, but all these can never match, our good old Gowry Ganga & British Bakery....On monday, we watched a couple of scary movies..."I still know what u did last summer" & "Sixth Sense".....they r older ones, but still worth watching. Especially, the sixth sense...If u have'nt watched it, i wud recommend the movie.....Tuesday, we went to Cincinnati, Ohio, for the green card formalities.....After completing it, we went to an acquarium....The newport Acquarium, has some rare species of turtles & fishes, in it. It was like, walking inside the sea.... a wonderful experience.....There were a lot of sharks too....imagine a shark just above ur head or at a distance where his teeth cud be seen so clearly......Just a piece of glass seperating us... what wud've happened, if the glass above or below me had broken???.....Before getting back to Lexington, we went to the Temple of Cincinnati. hey Xavier, idea for filling out the empty space is really good.....& abt Bastinado......i believe in ahimsa Xavier....BTW, Sangee wants to join us....she wanted some help with it.....Can u plz help her Xavier?....like how u mailed me.... My parents have now moved to Rajapalayam....My dad was promoted & transferred, a couple of months before my marraige. Since, my brother's schooling is over, my mom is moving there now....so next time i come to India, i won't have much, to do in Madurai, other than stopping for a few hrs, to visit my Grand parents & uncle... Vijay Babu.....how was ur brother's mrg?....so ur path is cleared now, & there is'nt much time for u to become a kelavanaar (as per ur research)!!!.... bye

 Yes, Kicha. it should look great. I got up very early today morning @ 7:00 am to get this thing right. After twiddling it for about half an hour, got it ready to go. Came to office, spent some time again to check it online & implemented it. A good thing about the blog is that I am learning new things almost everyday. Within three months, I have now become an expert copy, paste, tweak expert on CSS. Unfortunately, CSS support is lacking among browsers. I've got a very queer problem at home. CSS stylesheets are not displayed in IE 6 (Don't whether it is not displayed in my system alone or is it an universal factor. Most experts seem to agree with me). But the same style sheets work fine at office where I have an old IE 5 browser. Can't figure out what the problem is? I guess most of you might be using IEs. So working on the blog at home is out of the question. Moving on to the next best thing in CSS, Mozilla. I know Ram uses Mozilla. I do use it at offfice and home. IT displays CSS wonderfully. Even it has some lackings. The blog is not displayed correctly in Mozilla. Don't know why. So editing with Mozilla is again scuttled. The next thing is... Phoenix. A derivative of Mozilla. It supports all versions of CSS exactly. More on the design of the blog wil be continued tomorrow. My time is up for today. Please send in your bios. Bye.

 Empty Box strategy is great jax, Looking forward to the full blown version ...

 A good one... This is a famous paper written for an Oxford philosophy exam, normally requiring an eight page essay answer studded with source material and quotes and analytical reasoning. This guy handed the following back and aced the exam: OXFORD EXAMINATION BOARD 1987 ESSAY QUESTION 1.1a Question : What is courage? (50 Marks) Answer : This is courage

 hey! I have made some changes to the " Empty Box " contents. It is not empty now, though it looks empty. Move your mouse over Ganesh's ( hope he forgives me for telling the truth) and my name in the " Members " box. Expecting your comments and expecting your contributions for the other names.

 Just now read a beautiful essay on urlLink friendship by urlLink Ralph Waldo Emerson . It is very intersting with lots of thought provoking ideas and messages. Read it and then tell what you felt. Bye.

 I had to go out yesterday afternoon with my CEO for a client visit. We have learnt about TQM. But I saw TQM being truly followed at the client's place. They were following the 5S principles. Everything was so clean and neat, not like my desk.

 Hi, Ganja........ when I read those, I feel...I missed a lot...... But what to do, circumstances put something more weightage than others, K coming to the weekend....... Went to 3d film "Magic Magic....(tamil version of CHOTTA JADUGAR.........) on saturday, enjoyed a little with little headache.......... Finished washing. On sunday after 12 hrs continuous sleep, went to office for some work to be completed... Then monday as usual......... Jax, may be Rini busy in trying BASTINADO.

 Valli, have you tried this out with Ganesh or he with you? urlLink bastinado . Maybe Sinduja has tried it with Boomi or vice versa. Where is Rini? Busy...

 Kicha, read urlLink Claude Shannon's Information / Communication Theory here. Found an interesting history of languages (programming ones). See it urlLink here . Ciao,

 Hi, No blogs y'day... I was expecting to read a big list... nevertheless... I was back from Mysore late last night and rushed to office as usual this morning. I didn't have access to net as we were in an auditorium the entire day y'day. I was the 3rd guy to present and the last one before a heavy lunch y'day. This time again, I used my PL's laptop to load my presentation and thankfully I remembered the connections and did not look dumb in front of around 80 people. It went on well. The best part was, due to lack of time, all people were asked to put the questions off-line ie., mail/talk to the respective people. So, nobody bothered me with questions and I need not have to look dumb for the 2nd time... And the bus dropped us at our respective places late y'day night. Yep... Tilak has mailed... and will mail again sometime soon with the same line "it is my duty to do this even though I don't mail to the groups..."

 Everyone must have been busy (the start of the last week of the fifth month of the third year of the third millenium), Ram. BTW, When is Rini's wedding date ? (Sorry Ranjini, I forgot, 5th of June or July). I have to apply leave. Will try to make up for yesterday's postings today. Hey Tilak has mailed to the groups.

 Hei, What happened.... to JAX ..... what is this........its not fair.... 2 days no blogs at all............. what happened to kicha..........cant he browse from Mysore........... Poor sister is fighting alone, no one coming for her rescue......(sindu & rini) what is this...............is she not your blog mate............ she also ultimately fed up responding these naughty Guys........(Raapi & Vizbabu) Then Rajesh & Vijay update about the Marriage Function... Our friends meeting over there etc............ u all had....... nothing more, I had so many things today so only belated blog....and a GN/D to all, Whatever is applicable................. bye, catch u t'mmorrow.........

 I couldn't post anything today. I had to act being busy while doing nothing. Here is a good word, urlLink serendipity . I'll be online tomorrow late morning (11:30 - 13:30 IST). Maybe if someone else is online, we can have a chat. Have a nice weekend!

 Rajesh....u had asked for a week's permission....u did u come back so soon man?......aalum mandayum....stupid dog... Sindhu, Ranjini......."nimirndha nannadai, nerkonda paarvai, nilathil yaarkum anjaadha theermai, thimirndha gyana serukkum udaya Bharathi kanda, pudhumai pengal naam"......vaarungal Thozhigalae......kai kodungal....pagaivargalai veezhthuvoem!!! Other side of the balance is gaining more weightage.....vandhu thozhaingalaen diiiiiiii....... Thanx for the response Xavier.....I wud be happy, if i cud estivate this year in India....ha ha....am i using it in the right sense???.... happy week end...

 Hi, Hope u would have all read my mail to msitmmb.what jax had said in the blog is 100 % true.since he is writing lots of stories i think he can view it in a clear angle. i just mentioned the name bcoz it was from a person working in infy that's all. i do not have any other infirmation reg that person.this was all due to misinterpretation & nothing else. for vijay, machan i do not want to send comments to ur statistics & rajesh's comments bcoz u r both "Elavatta Pasanga". iam a little bit older than that. I am an adult( not a parent & not a child) ("Appadi P.C. Shekar teachings ethukavathu use Achea") hehhehehehehe bye

 Jax, Thanks for your tips.Yes..Really it's a help for me.I will be working on weekends to finish my post project.If I get a chance to go out then I will get you the cassette. Rajesh..where r u now? Hope it's too hot in chennai by this time.I may be back there within 10 days. Have a Great Weekend all of you. Bye, kavi

 dear vijaybabu, im very much happy to see your explanations for hybrid groups. some of them were really appreciable just like kilavi category :valli ,sindu kilavi aaga pora category : ranjini but one thing i cant accept is that u had given me platform with ganesh saying that we both come under naduthara vayasu category. by this single word u had increased 10 years in my age. for your kind information my age is now 23 and ganesh age is 32 .this is not fair and so i strictly opppose this and i hereby wants you to give a reply ststing your error to this group fainling which i may file a defamation suit on you for insulting me by putting with ganesh. hope ull turn back ur reply soon all things reg valli and sindhu is totally correct and i too support your words about them. (valli ku ramgopal annan aaana marmatha veliyida sollu ,ulaga maga kevalam athu) bye raapi

 Ok, Kicha. I guess you might have read Claude Shannon's Information / Communication Theory in college. Try recalling it. You'll understand what it is all about.

 I came across this interesting piece of information from urlLink Rediff . It is from the Indian Constitution. Article 51A . Fundamental Duties. It shall be the duty of every citizen of India : (a) to abide by the Constitution and respect its ideals and institutions, the National Flag and the National Anthem; (b) to cherish and follow the noble ideals which inspired our national struggle for freedom; (c) to uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India; (d) to defend the country and render national service when called upon to do so; (e) to promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst all the people of India transcending religious, linguistic and regional or sectional diversities; to renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women; (f) to value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture; (g) to protect and improve the natural environment, including forests, lakes, rivers and wildlife, and to have compassion for living creatures; (h) to develop the scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform; (i) to safeguard public property and to abjure violence; (j) to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievement. Are we following it in its true spirit? Your comments.

 Jax, if u watch with more precision... R sends a forward... K says it originated in infy... G sends a forward saying it was written by one from infy... V asks why K mentioned the company name and throws up the words "infy and non-infy" and "discrimination"... K questions why... K's question is... why should V take it as "discrimination" - a word which seems to be in a very bad taste for him... and demands for a clarification...

 Hi Good, blogs r pretty high with gr8 discussion along with msitmmb group also..... k by way.... Jax Nice to have a new word for my dictionary sheet... One more help what does "webber gibbers" mean in this .... ( How to break the worry habit before it breaks you Crowd worry out of your mind by keeping busy. Plenty of action is one of the best therapies ever devised for curing "Webber gibbers." ) Taken from 1 of the best fwds to our group mails..... Then sister, Yeah the ECE group is ultimate classic engg. field any time, If I would have opted for eng.. I should have completed that by now... Any way plng for an MTech related to Electronics & Commn. only.... k what happened to sindhu,......????? Rini, I know she will be busy... also Kavi too.......... nothing more, have some testing yet to be completed and some time_sheets etc.. formalities regarding the work has to be submited since end of month.... bye update u later...

 Kicha, I don't think there is discrimination. It is more a misunderstanding. This is what I think must have happened. Ganesh must have received a forward from someone in Infy (I don't know & don't want to know who). He forwards it to the group. He also mentions where he got it from. Vinitha reads the mail. She wonders why the company name is mentioned and shoots off a reply to the mail. Kicha gets worried at this mail and writes another reply to Vinitha's mail. So it begins... Ganesh has no part to play in this interaction, so leaving him out, it comes down to two persons, K & V. V thinks G is trying to make fun of K by not refering to him by his name ( while he is not). G was just trying to give us a background information about the forward. So she thinks why should the forward's origin is given, when there are no information given for other forwards in the group. Now K reads her mail and feels that he is 'dicriminated' against because of his company/people. I hope by now, you would've realised that all this was caused to misinterpretation and misunderstanding. The above is just my imagination of what the problem is. It might be real or might not. Unless the concerned persons put forward their points, noithing more can be said.

 Tried accessing Yahoo! mail. I was able to get through. Here, we have a procedure, if anyone wants to access a blocked domain, we need to get it unblocked through the proper channels. Some one must have requested access to Yahoo!. Valli, Read your mail, I understand your concerns. The same problems exists here as I mentioned earlier. I still haven't received a few cds I should have received months ago. The postal dept here also doesn't care about the items sent. I think you should use a courier service like Fedex for sending things over here. They ' might ' get things delivered promptly and safely. Anyway thanks for trying. I thought you might have a reduced shipping rates. Usually Microsoft does it. I guess have to wait for Office 2003 to arive on Indian shores. An interesting discussion is beginning to take shape in the msitmmb group. These inspirational forwards are very nice to read. but it would be nice if someone takes a little time to maybe put it in a printer-friendly format. We can maybe take a printout of it and stick it someplace where we will read it often and try to follow it. Read an interesting word today, ' estivation ' It is a noun and has three meanings: 1. The act of spending or passing the summer. 2. Zoology : A state of dormancy or torpor during the summer. 3. Botany :The arrangement of flower parts in the bud. If possible, I will try to post a new word daily or an interesting piece of information. Ram & Rini had been asking me to do this for a very long time. Bye.

 Hi, I tried very hard to resist bringing the msitmmb politics to the blog. But I just can't refrain... I wonder what is happening... why are mails being taken too personally... and why these unecessary words like "discimination". And why do people think one is trying to discriminate if he uses his company's name... I wonder if I were working in "Mangaathaa technologies" and used that name in my mail, then will they think I'm discriminating... is it a punishment I'm getting for working in a big company... ???

 Valli, I check my mails only once a week. I cannot check it at the office. So usually I check it on Sundays morning somewhere around 11:30 to 1:30. You ca catch me online at that time. If there is any mail that you want me to reply immediately, use the mail address in the blog , 'Contact' link. Vijay, Convey my wishes to your bro. Bye.

 hey Xavier, i had mailed u a couple of days back....actually got ur mail Id from Kishore, but lost it....so i had sent it to ur Yahoo ID....i know u keep cheking all ur inboxes regularly....Where on earth has my mail gone?.....had u seen it, u shld've responded by now.... The following week end is a longer one......Next monday is obsorbed as the "Memorial day"....salutations to the American Soldiers....tuesday, we got to go to Cincinnatti, the place where Ganesh graduated. We have been called by the INS office for finger printing (checking our criminal backgrounds), a part of Green card processing..... korangu.....don't try to threathen me korangu guess Ranjini wud've not seen it at all...... Sindhu, wat happened to u????.....pongi elundhidu!!!.....puliyai virattum veera tamilachihal naam...oru kurangai viratta mudiyaadhaaa.....

 tomorrow i m going to my home. next one week i may not participate in our blog. nice to see the feedbacks from valli, kishore and jax for the statistics. for valli's feedback i prepared a nice replay, surely valli ll accept that, i ll send it after seeing the feedbacks from other members. so if anybody hav points to tell abt that statistics, post it as early as possible. Alert if anyone is ready to join hands with valli, then sorry i cant help u.

 Yeah, ganesh, I chatted with Sangeetha last Sunday. Told her about the blog. Will invite her. If possible her through the joining process. I think as we are getting more and more people, we should try and prepare a small FAQ to help the newcomers. Anyone willing to take the challenge. You can refer the Blogger FAQ. Bye,

 Hi, I'm being moved to a project as a consultant for .NET and BizTalk Server... Usually freshers are not put in such consulting assignments, but there is a heavy resource crunch and they are forced to send me for this. There was some speculation that I might be sent to Pune or Bhubaneshwar, but thankfully, the project is within Bangalore only. I have to report for it from June 9th and the consulting period will be for 4 months... after which I'll get back to my usual R&D stuff... My team people have asked me to keep in touch with them in case I need any help... and I'll need a lot of that for sure... Its going to be tuff and challenging... The project is for a client called RUAN... a logistics company based in US. Thats is all I know abt the specifics of the project as of now...

 Hi, Ram got ur mail.Thanks da machan. Reliance has come up with a new scheme for corporates & govt officials.so was busy in that process. Saw "Samy " 4 times that too 3 times in 24 hours. I saw it with a friend at 3 p.m. then when i came home my uncle had bought "Samy"c.d. so saw it again at night. then the next day i had to see it again with my U.G friends. can see it n number of times for "Trisha"alone. (valli -it is repetition for u) then jax sangee also wants to join in our group.her id is san_allure@yahoo.com. then saravanan was here in chennai.spoke to him but could not meet him. that is all. bye

 Just a passing thot... If anything's possible, then is it possible that nothing's possible?

 Interesting to read VizBabu's categorisation of the group. Wondering why s/w pros are languishing at the bottom of the list. And why Viz is not a s/w pro. Got up at 6 am today morning after a very long time, (last time was in August, I used to get up at 4 am). My parents have left for Madurai and from there to Palayamkottai. My brother has left to Ooty. So I'm home alone till Monday. Due to a lot of marriages to attend and birthdays, my salary has disappeared in a jiffy. So I won't and can't eat out often. So have to improve my cooking and try out new recipes. My first experiment is today afternoon or evening, a coffee. Found a lot of recipes on coffee on the net. So will try out a couple of recipes by tonight. Bye,

 Hi, FCMOFTN - Future CM of Tamil Nadu ... and that was an intersting piece of statistic visbabu came up with... but only one thing I can't get.. how come kavi became "little girl"... she must be "little BIG girl"... But we need to be very careful of little boys. Because it was the little boy and the fat man that changed the course of history... ;-)

 Hi Kavi...I'm not interested in colors....just pencils...& grabbing Ganesh's work, is actually a head ache for him....he needs to understand the way i program, so that he shld be able to handle any future maintanance probs......Anyway, i need to keep myself busy......seri ma....i'll not say anything abt ur annan....mannichikko....but just need to know one thing...what's FCMOFTN? Hi Ram anna.....our advice was to opt for the current hottest branch...ECE.....don't know what's he up to..... Vijay Babu...aanalum unakku irukkura koluppu irukkae..... romba paesina.....nee office la ootthura jollu pathi ellar kittayum solliduvaen.....me & Sindhu Paatiya?......If at all, we cud get hold of u, we wud've shuttled u, back & forth....vetti vijay babu...moonja paaru....Rama Bhaktan, Anjineyar maadhiri moonja vaechikittu.....paecha paaru....korangu korangu..... my archanai will continue 'morrow also.....expecting Sindhu & Ranjini to join hands with me..... bye valli.

 Breaking News: Legal threat to commercial Linux users The owner of the UNIX operating system today warned that Linux is an unauthorised derivative of its software and that commercial users of Linux may be legally liable for violation of intellectual copyright. In a media release issued by its Sydney office, the SCO Group, which owns UNX, said Linux contained code which it claims as its intellectual property. Read urlLink full-story

 Hi, Whatever VisBabu means by "hybrid" group...no guesses but eager to hear. and whatever ramgopal meant by, "but kicha is in infy, blr.. but what to do.. cant figure OUT and IN...." no guesses again... but want to know what it meant or tried to mean... some breaking biz news: rupee ended the day yesterday at Rs.46.9 / dollar. It has strengthened considerably. It was 49.7 in June '02. And that is not good news for the Indian IT firms. iFlex CFO says he expected rupee to depreciate by 3-4% annually as it was happening all this time. But contrary to all expectations rupee is becoming stronger by the day and expected to rise further... Either Indian companies move business out of US slowly and steadily... or perish. Nobody wants the latter to happen and the former is going to be a big struggle.... so much for India's IT prowess...

 Dear Kavi, I noticed you used "My final compre is preponed" in one of your posts. The word 'prepone' is used by most people (mostly subcontinental people) to mean the opposite of , i.e. move forward in time. Nothing wrong in using it , though if Sinduja and Valli use it in Uk or US, people might think they are blabbering. The right word to use would be 'advance' like "My final compre has been advanced". Note the 'has been' - past tense. You shouldn't use 'is advanced' - It is wrong. Hope this small bit of grammar has been useful to you,

 Hi, Kavi, I thought of a book first. but as I am giving her a story, that idea was a no no. As for CDs, she doesn't have a CD player. I thought of an audio cassette. She liked one cassette. it is not available in Coimbatore. I tried buying on the net. I found it at Sony Music, but they don't have a delivery in Coimbatore. Maybe those in Bangalore can help me. The name of the cassette is "Dance with Me". It is a soundtrack, featuring Chayanne and Vanessa Williams. The cassette may be available at Planet M or online at urlLink Sony Music . Buy and send it to me. I'll reimburse you ;-). As I was working late last night, I couldn't go out to buy a present. Planning to escape from office later. last night watched three films, "Matrix Reloaded", "Samy" & "Putiya Geethai". The two tamil films was watched by fastforwarding whenever there was a song or a fight or any sentimental dialogue or jokes. But I wached Matrix completely. An intellectual film, my brother was watching it when I went home last night. he said he was watching it for the second time and it is difficult to understand the movie. The movie is totally superb, can't wait to watch it in the theatre. Bye for now,

 Good Valli, although Medicine is considered premier..... anyway only in Eng.. there are various areas tooo shine... what is ur brothers idea of choosing which branch of eng.... Then, Vizaybabu... good ready to read ur analysis... hope u will pour out some of the thoughts which already I have in mind... Then kavi,... yesterday's blank u have covered with 2days 2 posts (1 and the same) no probs, Jax will take care of editing.... isn't it.... yeah sindhu and jax... u both r right in figuring reason behind Ghot as Fish... but kicha is in infy, blr.. but what to do.. cant figure OUT and IN.... then coming towards my 4 hrs sleep.. which jax remembered me... yeah Man although I work at office for late hours..

 Hi, jax, thanx for giving ur cousin's ID. I contacted him and he's told he'll try for some docs to help me. Meanwhile, today is the last day to submit income-tax proposals for me here. And as u might expect I'm yet to learn or plan anything. So, submitted it with the only field that I could enter - the PAN number. This means, I'll lose heaviliy on tax until November when this thing will be online again and then I can show some savings and get my tax exemptions. And whatever I lose until then (or after that) I can file for returns next april with the tax consultant who comes here for getting refund of the additional tax payments. So... I'm gonna earn less from this month ;-( ... VisBabu... No Good Evening from u y'day and no Good Morning from u today... What happened... and only 1 post before this today...

 Bon Jour mes amis, It is good to hear from all of you. Ranjini : Where are the snaps? Did you put in Yahoo! photos or did u mail them to me? Sindu : How was Dreamcatcher other than scary? Horror movies are supposed to scary not funny like our Tamil horror flicks. Heard it was a wonderful film. I didn't have the time to put the page numbers. I can do it only in the weekend. Valli : I need a lot of things. But you can't get me all of them. If I require anything, I'll let you know. Right now, I would love to get a copy of Microsoft Office 2003. It is available free from Micosoft website. But includes a shipping charge of $19.95. I don't know your exact location, State, zip code. So I could not calculate how much it would cost you. Maybe you can also check it out at the urlLink Microsoft website . Maybe Ganesh has got it for his company. The Microsoft OneNote beta cd was functional. I installed it and it worked very fine. Microsoft says I can use it till November. That is still 6 months away. Hoping to spend the next few weeks putting the s/w through its pace. My writing mind decided that I had to write an article on OneNote. Let us see if I have the time. Kicha : Maybe you can contact my cousin, Alex at Bangalore. He works in IBM. His mail id is jraymond at in.ibm.com or ibm.in.com. I forgot which. Please check it out. Ram : Seem to be working very late at your office. I think your aim of sleeping for only four hours has come true. What figures were you mentioning to Kicha? The ones on paper or the ones on road? Ganja : Good to hear that you are keeping yourself fit. I get to play cricket rarely nowadays. Looking forward to hear more of your crickexploits. Hey, I had asked you all for suggestions for a birthday gift for my friend. I still haven't received it yet. It is tomorrow (May 21). I only have a story that I wrote for her with me. Ranjini has already read it. I'll send it to the others later. I wanted to give something in the materialistic format. I had thought of buying her a pair of shoes. But I cannot, because last night her brother called me and said that he was going to buy her shoes. So, we went out last night to buy her shoes. I never knew that girls had so small feet. Also never knew or understood how they wear those high heels or stools or platforms. Saw a lot of shoes last night. Luckily, her brother knew what she liked. Black coloured shoes with straps and little or minimal heel length. Our half an hour search ended finally. But I felt that ash grey or silver coloured shoes are nice as they are neutral colours and will suit any dress. As said, now I cannot buy her shoes. One idea is to buy her a bag, what do you girls call it, handbag or pouch? Still contemplating other gifts also. Your suggestions are welcome and please make it soon. Adieu,

Then enjoyed well ah Rini & Sindhu....hmmm s Kavi, enna " " post idhu...........what does it mean... kicha, try to c some figures out... then ur mind will be a bit relaxed to find out what is in IBM MQ series.... Yes, Ofcourse I enjoyed the Weekend at the most, went to an ashram nearby....

Cool food and nice sleep... In that ashram they have the vishwaruppam statue of Lord Krishna and The Ratha(krishna & Arjuna) in a magnificiant height... Entire gita is depicted in Hindi, English and Kannada... Very nice place to visit... But I think if maintained properly, i.e, with much popularity etc... then it will match Kempfort Shiva Temple.....

 Hi, sindu, so, for a change, he shuts ur mouth... I guess he'll not have this opportunity very often... hope, he made best use of it... Here, I'm still struggling to figure out something about IBM MQ Series. rini's suggestion of having names on top is really good and looks nice too...

Bye Sindu



 Hi, Watched "Indru Muthal" on CD.OK movie with jokes from Ramesh kanna & K.S.Ravikumar. Played cricket after a gap of 4 years with my friends in chennai.was soaked in sweat.bcoz of smoking these days i could feel the difference while playing.was exhausted very soon. we usually play in front of our house in adyar.neighbours said that for 4 years they were peaceful but now every sunday they have to take the pain of retrieving the ball for us if it goes inside their houses. now all the neighbours have dogs in their houses.so u should have seen us picking the ball & running towards the gate.it was nice enjoying after 4 long years. bye urs ganesh

 urlLink Hi everyone, Recieved my copy of Microsoft OneNote beta today. Our efficient postal dept. had delivered it to me with one of the cds cracked. the crack had occured when they had stamped the post office seal. I am very angry and disappointed also. But there seems a hope because I received two cds, one was the demo itself and the other one must be a presentation on OneNote. praying that it was the presentation cd that broke. Those in Bang, any chance of dropping in at MS's office there to see if there are any office 2003 betas available. Shipping a free copy to India costs around 20$. Maybe Valli can help me. She can maybe get a free copy there and send it over to me. Also searching the net for any cracks of Office 11 or Office 2003. Someone finds anything. Inform me. Ranjini, I've made a few changes regarding the identity of the poster. If you want an easier way to post to the blog, try reading one of my previous posts urlLink here . The best option is to login to blogger and check the "remember me" checkbox. After posting, don't sign out. You can go to blogger anytime without signing in. If you are worried or using a public computer like Valli, there is another way. I tried it out once, didn't come out well. Need some time on it though. Please bear with me. I'll check out the story problem later. Seems you are out there visiting a lot of kutcheris. I am jealous. Bye,

 from G.Rajesh Prabu sivagangai to www.blogger.com dear sir/mam sub: request to grant me leave for 15 days as im on my vacation trip in my native place from 14 th may im unable to send any mails to this blogger and so i request u to grant me a leave for 15 days upto june 1st.i promise you to send mails frequently in this blogger after i come back to chennai. thank you very much with regards G.Rajesh Prabu Future CMOFTN

 hi friends, ya as my senior is absent today, i am just keeping the blog updated! Welcome Vijay and ya jax, i always wanted to tell u to put Archives in list box in reverse chronology and this is well taken care. So its good. And ya cant we have an Edit link in the page so that only the members can go directly go to the Edit page directly rather than going to blogger and then getting into that page? And jax, how about putting the name of the writer first on top of the page rather than at the bottom. Coz if there is a blog as big as mine , u will have to scroll to bottom to see who has written it. So better put the writers name on top. Do it if u feel ok. Yes Valli sindhu, namba bloggeraye battle field aakkittenga pola irukku and only now the tycoon and hurricanes have subsided i believe. This atmosphere is good! Kavi will be back soon to our group when posted. And ya Sindhu and valli i will mail u people my snaps to ur personal ids. What happened to Rajesh Ganesh? No blogs! Jax i couldnt read ur story as i wasnt able to open the file. Dont know whats the probs and once done will let u know about it. Hei ladies how both are u doing well in cooking? And valli how do u spend ur time? Mail us what is ur daily routine and some interesting things too..... Ok then bye for now from Ranjini

 Hi, rini, I've heard the "Bhavayami Gopalabalam" song by M.S. I've got my own favorite song composed by Annamacharya. Have u heard of "naanaati baduku naatakamu...". If u buy the cassette "Annamacharya kirtanas by MS" this will be the last song in that cassette. This is my favorite... I've got an emotional bonding to this song... Literally tears flow out of my eyes when I listen to it... just try it... not sure if it'll be of ur liking... but it surely drenches my heart everytime I hear...

 Hei, I have got speakers in our dept. but nay not to my system. Ya we are not supposed to listen to songs I believe and our company hasn't just grown up till to the fact of allowing its employees to listen to songs as we work. Anyway for testing, we got two speakers and finally after a much longer struggle, I could download one of my favourite song on to my system's hard disk. Guess what song it is? I bet u people , u cant. Coz u would have not heard me speak about it even once before. Ya have u guys heard, "Bhavayami Gopalabalam" song by M.S.? Its in Pancharatnamala composed by Annamacharya. My god, how divine her voice is! Ya I first listened to the same song by Bombay Jeyashree. I never felt an attraction, though I like her voice too and find her to be one of the best upcoming vocal artist. But then when I listened to the same song by M.S. once, just once, it stuck to me so hardly that at last it drove me to find speaker and then download a 4.4 MB song for almost more than an hour spanning for two days and then listen to that blissful song today morning as I start my day! By the end of the day, I think I would have learnt the entire song. Such a song, which I think I have never heard....... I really wonder, still how many such songs or much more beautiful than this song are there which remains still unheard by me. Oh god, wish I hear to all those songs during this life time itself. How jealous of me na. (To others who werent into early blog list, my words might sound a bit mystical as i talk about Carnatic music, but jax, kishore and Ram are used to it and hope u all will in near future). Hei now a days i go to concerts too. Ya last week on Wednesday, i happened to go to Unni krishnan' concert. Before I had no liking towards his voice as its too soft for a guys voice. And my likes were of those who had a solid voice like Sanjay Subramanyam (one more upcoming male vocalist). I have always felt that though there was sweetness in Unni's voice, there is no solidity in his voice. But ....... But that day, on his live concert, u should see the way he majestically expounded to us the world of CMusic. Never have i heard of even a single song in CMusic sung by him. But then i was ably carried by his Highly Masculine, rich in solidity and glorious voice of his. Of all the four concerts i have attended till date i rated this to be the best (note:even better than Nithyashree Mahadevan, my favourite). Then just imagine how enjoyable that evening should have been! Then coming to this weekend, Saturday I slept like anything till 10 o clock and then remembered of poor srini, who would be waiting for me to turn up, so rang up and told him that I would come and meet him around 12 o clock. He too had to wait and I went there. I was wearing a new cotton saree and I was looking like a scare crow in it. So frightened Srini and his cousins as the saree was not staying with me but always sticking a yard away from my body and srini's cousins started kidding me asking, if I am wearing a gown or what. Even when I sit, I had an aura of my dress around me. So sent srini to get a new chudi which I had given for stitching to a tailor near by srini's place. Oh , he too went on that scorching sun and got it for me and I felt relaxed only when I had fitted myself into that. In the evening, we went for shopping to commercial and got 4 chudi materials fata fat in just half an hour and came back home coz I was feeling tired. (Coz I wanted to sleep a bit more) Sariyaana thoogu moonjinnu srini kitta irundhu thittu vaangatha korai thaan. So did I spend my Saturday and then comes the asusal but always special Sunday. I started my day early and did bit of washing and started to srini's place. On my way I got some nice red & pink roses and two stems of gladiolus and two stems of Tuber rose for our prayer. After prayer, as usual we went to ISKCON temple. From there we went to one of his friend's place. He has brought his wife and kid after delivery and we had a nice time cooing and playing with the kid. Dint know how time passed away and it was evening 4 o clock. Oops we had plans to go to BalaMurali krishna's concert, but we thought it would be late and so decided not to go for it and came back home. After a long time, we got time to talk as now a days we don't find time, though we meet often, we often talk regarding our daily activities and nothing useful. But then, after long time we enjoyed talking something useful. Oho, my Sunday is also over and I need to prepare for my Monday! Ya i came to office as usual and read blogger and started keying in this blog...... Ok then will mail u later Ranjini

 A few changes made to the blog, Vijay's name added and Archives section has been modified to a dropdown box. Go through it and expecting your comments.

 Welcome to the team, Vijay.

 hi, good morning to everyone. even if i dont post any important message, atleast i ll try to post good morning and good night daily. -vijay

 Hi, It was a weekend as usual. Watched the urlLink Austrian Grand Prix . An urlLink exciting race with lots of urlLink drama and excitement . I can't wait for the next race, Monaco, the most hardest racing circuit in the world. Last weekend, I read two stories. One, " urlLink The Pelican Brief " by John Grisham. It was made into a urlLink movie starring Julia Roberts & Denzel Washingon. It is amazing to know that many of this books have been made into movies. The only other author (if you discount Shakespeare) whose books have been made into a lot of movies is urlLink Michael Crichton . I read the other story on the net. It was an interesting story of love between the Devil and a woman. An interesting idea for a story. urlLink Read it here . For those interested in Business stories, urlLink here is an interesting one I read a short time ago. That's all folks,

 Hi, Had a somber weekend. Waited for Ramgopal's call to go out somewhere... and... am still waiting... Sunday afternoon saw a hindi movie on CD... "Pran jayey par shaan na jayey" (lose life but not self-esteem)... it was a satirical art-film that revolves around the lives and happenings in typical middle-class families living together in a mansion in Bombay... A truely satirical movie that ended with a poke at RK Laxman's "common-man". Not many people might like it for all that happens in the movie but all that was nothing but reflections of any middle-class household. It also touched some happenings of national priority and their impact on such families. To me... it was a good attempt. Apart from that nothing useful. Just went on to read another junk mail in our groups and gave another somber reply to it. I'm tired of this.

 Hi, Valli good to see ur brother getting such good marks. "Kudumbamae padikara kudumbama irukku" Hahahahaha rajesh is in sivagangai now.i speak to him daily. than jax, i spoke to vijay and he has some problem in joining us. so send him the link once again. planning to sleep all thru on sunday. bye

 Dear Ram, The word you should have used is GHOTI not GHOT to write the word Fish. For those you who can't understand, Bernand Shaw, i think once while commenting on the English language said that hereafterwards, Fish is to be written as "Ghoti". Reason: the first letter "F" of fish has a similar pronunciation as "gh" in 'enough'. I forgot the exact word he used for 'i' in 'fish'. The 'ti' comes from any word ending in 'tion' like nation or demonstration., where 'ti' is pronunced as 'sh'. Valli, what's your bro's plan, doctor or engineer? reagrding the bottom pane refresh, it is nothing but blogger updating itself every minute. Also this problem would be evident in machines using IE5.x or higher or Mozilla 1.3 or Netscape 7. Thsi is because Blogger uses two interfaces. A "Standard" one that Valli and Ram or anyone using the latest browser will be using. the other is a "LoFi" interface for those using older browsers like IE 5. I have been using IE5 for the past few weeks as my Mozilla browser crashes often, I couldn't notice the problem. Currently, I am typing this using Mozilla. The bottom pane does get refreshed. urlLink It is a feature, not a bug . I had said yesterday that there were plans to go to Ooty this weekend. It has been cancelled. I've to spend this Sunday as usual. Bye,

 Wow! two posts within 45 seconds from me and Ram. Maybe as Ram said the refreshing in the blog might be due to this. Everyone seems to going somewhere this weekend. Happy weekend to those who have holidays tomorrow. I'm off for lunch now,

 Hai..... very nice to c blogs from 25 hrs engaged person..... Hope Rini is ahead of time..... By way, Valli, its true I also experience automatic refreshing of the bottom pane of the web page where u edit the blogs. I think its blog's facility to update us with recent postings even when we type.... and hope Jax cant do anything regarding that.... Talked to Sweet... she is here for an interview...Hope she will do it good... and , blrmsitmians.. list increases.... By way, tommorrow planned to cut office and accompany my aunt to my relatives home nearby.... Hence, if there is any meeting within blr gang, it will be nice to schedule sunday for my presence... Yeah, just now kicha came up with flash news.. Kavi is going to native after a months gap.... Bangalore - 1

 Hi, Great to hear from Ranjini after a long time. two weeks I think? Rini, you have a Yahoo id, why don't you upload it there and send us the link. It'll save you time and also you can mail it from there itself. It has some great features. Why don't we use the facilities and the technologies. I guess you might know your way around urlLink Yahoo!. You had posted your message twice, I think you are too excited . Don't worry, I'll delete the repeated message. You think Black is better? I think I'll also try out some options. next week perhaps. Yesterday, I had the time to go through the souvenir. It was a great experience. Felt like sitting there in the class and listening to you all. I miss those days. This week, I might be going to Ooty for the flower show this Sunday. Still undecided on nr. of persons. Hey guys and gals, got any interesting ideas to improve the participation of people in the group? Blog it. I have got a great idea of improving the participation in the groups. Starting next monday, I'll be removing a random member from the group. If that person doesn't reply within a week's time, they will be removed permanently :-). An interesting thought. Please suggest some useful ideas. Don't send anything like the above one. Ranjini, you are exempt as you might have a lot to catch up (mails, blog archives). BTW expecting your comments on the story, if possible. Bye,

 Hi friends! Hei no sorry and all, coz u people would know that i would not refrain myself from blogging if i had had time. Now i got a pinch of time and so do i blog! Before that i just checked blogger . Oh my what a rush of bloggs............. Oops so many new faces and that too all of them flooding the blogger.... with their best experiences of all times. Hi new trio, Valli, Sindhu and Kavi, Welcome to the world of blogging. Ore amarkalama irukku, namma blogger. But jax, Black background was better than white, so go for some more changes regarding the looks. Hei, all of u those who wanna see my engagement snaps, do send me the ids to which i can mail u those snaps. Coz jax request not to send any personal mails to office id, i dint, else i would have. So u, those who are interested just pass on ur mail id and i will send them to u all to enjoy. Ok then will get back with my tales during my days of absence later. Till then bye

 Hi all, As Kicha had said, yesterday seemed to be the day with lots of posts to the blog, I think about 12 posts were made yesterday. It is good to know that. Valli: You had said that there was some problem in the bottom portion of the blog.I didn't seem to find any problem there. Is your problem occuring when you were viewing the blog or did it occur when you were inside blogger.com. Could you be more specific? If ther is anything I can do, I'll do it. BTW where do you mostly use the net, home or outside? You seem to be waving a lot of white flags often. Hey just now read an interesting piece about warfare on urlLink Rediff . Kicha: Since we have to make do with only one page, we cannot have a next page button. But certainly, there is an option for displaying more entries in the blog. Currently, the blog is set up to display 5 recent entries. I felt that as there might be days when we might be posting at all say like Sundays. I didn't want just one or two entries to be displayed in the blog. I'll change the settings to display 7 or 8 most recent posts. If it crosses that, you have to read it in the archives. I feel that number is sufficient, otherwise the page might go on scrolling downwards. Sindu: Hope your trip went very fine. Ganja: Nee, corporate salesle, note the time-aaa. Where is Rajesh? No posts from him at all. Sari, indha annan-thangachi sandaiya neeruthurengala. Undane 'avana neruthasollu, naan neruthuraennu ' dialogue annupathe. Still waiting to hear Bye,

 Hi, Yesterday it was tight...real tight... after a looong time... Me and my team-mate (a senior guy) tussled with .NET for more than 6 hours (at-a-stretch) until 9PM IST to get a performance critical task going... and we made it at last... and I rushed to the restaurant to have a meal in a hurry and managed to catch the bus at 9.15PM IST... the habit of eating fast has its own advantages... This weekend... I want to get some things right regarding my income tax... Until yesterday, I seemed to be a kid with no responsibilities and today all of a sudden I'm a kid (still) who has to worry about a whole lot of things... I need to learn on how to save, what to save... will get the help of our Maths-expert (guess who) to aid me with some calculations and need to go to Post Office (remember that place...?) to learn about PPF, NSC etc. That place still has got some utilities...if not for snail mails... and by tuesday I need to declare my Investment proposals here in infy. I remember the question posed by Valli (I think) to Ravichandran on private company people getting away from tax and Govt people forced into it... and he replied "thappu seyya mudiyadhavan thappu seyyaravana paathu poraama pada kudadhu"... :) Infy is very strict on I-T and cuts as per our proposals from our salary and the final leftovers, if any, are deducted at the end of fiscal year... in case we pay more tax than needed then infy also arranges tax consultants to get the refund back... Looking forward to (probably) one of the few weekends remaining... guess why... grapevine sources here say that we'll be working on saturdays too... from July... nothing official yet...

 Hi all, Yes Xavier, may be u shld've added the page numbers......My cartridges r empty now ...so I'm not able to take a print out immediately....maybe i can try reading it again next week.... Kavi, great to see ur post di.....keep blogging.... Ganesh, u shld'nt see the nadhimoolam & Rishimoolam for the bro-sis relationship.....ok me & Ram anna will forgive u....compromise....white flag..... Sindhu....white flag, for u too.....ok Sindhu how far is ur office from ur home?... nice to see ur post Ram anna....so u still hang out late in the night, in ur ffice premises?..... It's been raining here almost all thru the night....we get Tornado warnings very often...... Spoke to vinitha yesterday.....she's fine.....It takes almost 14hrs by road, to hit her place from mine.... Xavier, i've been having a problem today.....the lower window, showing the posts....it refreshes itself every minute....why's this happening?... Valli.

 Hi, I think today is the record for the most number of blog posts in a single day (combined time-zones)... jax, can u verify it... at this rate we might need more entries to be displayed / page... or a next page button...

 Hi, nice to see so much blogs. Ram : No new scheme da machan. I am now in corporate sales. Hence pressure is high.Then sathish,rajesh,sinoop & myself have cancelled our Dae long time back.we also got our 10,000 back.

 Hey all, I have added the subscribe to this blog option. It was there a month back, but due to template changes, it was not added. It is done now. Guess what Bulb has subscribed. She will be receiving the updates made in the blog to her mailbox. Let us who all will subscribe. BTW, members of the blog need not subscribe, unless you want to recieve a mail everytime someone posts a message. Welcome Kavi, try to post as often as you could. Any queries, ask your infy senior Kicha. Convey my regards to Sweet. Bye for now,

 Hi Friends, It's my first msg to blogger. Happy to meet you all through blog. My training is going well. And there are so many assignments,tests..really they are making me read a lot. Now java course is going on.I have done a project in java-just 4 days project- for java course. Yesterday I had project presentation.I am the PL of my team ,so I did the presentation.It went on well.From tomm I have my oracle course.Though kishore place is 2 buildings apart..we used to see each other once in a week. Hope I will not blog often for the next one month. Swetha is in bangalore.She came here on monday.If possible bangalore'ans can arrange a meet in this week or next week.But I am not sure about myself since I might go home this week. I haven't met ranjini yet ...'coz I cudn't get an appointment from her to meet her since she is so busyyyy.. Valli & Sindhu ,glad to read your msg's here ... Cheers... Kavi

 Hi all, Good to see a flurry of posts in the blog from Valli, Kicha and Ram. My replies: Valli : Valli, Glad to read your comments (that too from a SCO). I feel you must have read the story as the pdf file. Did you print it out and then read it? Becasue the pages would appear sort of flowless if you read it online. You should have printed it out and then read it. But then, I made a mistake of not including page numbers. If I had done so you have been able to print and arrange it properly before reading it. Anyway try reading it out after printing it it out. Same advice to Sindhu and Rini. Other don't worry. I'll let you have access to the files. I have put it online at Yahoo! briefcase. But right now, I have made it a private briefcase. once I have make it a public briefcase, I'll inform the link. You too can read them. Kicha : Your suggestion for the empty box is valid. My arguments against it are: 1) As the content for the box had to be permanent (i.e. not to be modified at all or will be modified ocassionally a la members list), having the news there would be say a waste of time. 2) But as you said, maybe something like events that involves most of us say for example, Rini's upcoming marriage, an online chat could be put there. It could serve as a reminder. 3) talking of chat, I found a urlLink link at Yahoo! that will tell if a person is online or not. It will display an icon, if the user is logged into Yahoo!. Say for example, i have logged into Yahoo!, you are reading the blog. My Yahoo! icon will show that I'm online. Still haven't tried it out. Maybe we can colloborate over it, we can try to implement it. 4) The Blogrolling section is a trial version. You too can create your own blog roll. This section will mostly contain sections that I am interested in, say, a sort of My Bookmarks. if everyone creates thier own blogroll, we can have a separate section for each one of us with our names. This decision is left to everyone in the group. As I have to update only my links section only at urlLink Blogrolling.com , I need not touch the template code at all except to add the html code once when i set it up. Ram : That was quite a big post. As Ram had added his location of posting, I think that is a very good idea since this blog is updated from several countires, (an international blog). Sometime back I had written about Geo URL. There is also another thing known as warchalking. In our case, urlLink blogchalking , Visit to know more. bye,

 Hi, I can't resist sharing the following piece from the Infy BB... (and for those who wonder what BB is - its Bullettin Board)... this is the lightest side of any sport... Enjoy... Soccer at its BEST!!! It concerns a match played some time back between Barbados and Grenada in some cup competition. Barbados needed to win the game by two clear goals in order to progress to the next round. Now the trouble was caused by a daft rule in the competition which stated that in the event of a game going to penalty kicks, the winner of the shoot-out would be awarded a 2-0 victory. (Yes, I'm sure you can all see what's coming....) With 5 minutes to go, Barbados were leading 2-1, and going out of the tournament. Then, when they realised they were probably not going to score against Grenada's massed defence, they turned round, and deliberately scored an own goal, to level the scores. Grenada, themselves not being stupid, realised what was going on, and then attempted to score an own goal themselves. However, the Barbados players started defending their opponents goal to prevent this. In the last five minutes, therefore, spectators were treated to the incredible sight of a team defending their opponents goal against attackers desperately trying to score an own goal! Naturally, the game went to penalties, which Barbados won... This story is completely true. Apparently it was being televised live, so maybe we'll see highlights of it soon! Now how's that for sportsmanship....

 Hope, Sweet Dreams for ValliGanesh..... Wakeup call for SindhuBoomi...... (its good to get up during Brahma Mughurtham) and a Very Good Morning to others....... Nice, Frequent posts about pleasure happenings.... Happy to Read..... A warm Hearty welcome to the new joinee........Valli......(Blogger of the Week, My sister) yeah, as the written chaffers in the blog from some of the bloggers..... really I was busy in the past 4 - 5 days.... Due to testing, Packaging & Realease process, and also document control, user permissions, Groups spliting etc.... Updating and following the new CMM I QMS implemented over here at HSS. Hope one week has passed without a single blog from my side.... extremely sorry for not coping up with your speed.... although I am provided with reqd. resources. But, I read them frequently and update myself........ Sindu, Good Hope ur accent is improving well.... yes Valli, very happy to read ur driving styles..... Oh, Ganeju.... Howz storm now man..... What, hectic job in reliance????........why any new scheme ur coming up with.... Well done Kicha... Go ahead da... its the right time u have to put ur efforts effeciently & effectively........ By way, yesterday spoke to Rini after a very long time.... U know... she is looking smart in our (in)_formals... (Pant & Shirt / T Shirt) JEANS is SCHEDULED After MARRIAGE... (I'm Right Rini!!!) Myself and Kicha just a day back had a look at her snaps.... Ok I have some testing to be done on the client server, let me go into that.... bye4now, take care............ Rest in Next Blog...... Yeah Jax, I too feel... what Sindhu says (Long term Target / Goal : 1 year or so....) I talked to Kavi too, busy in her exams,...Reg. viz babu busy in his bros marriage.... Raappi... where r u man??? 15/5/2003 RamG C Garden City 10:00 AM (IST) Think & Win............. PS: - Since My Dear Sister has let her words out..... I am obliged to post in a new fashion.......... Pl. Adjust, next post will be normal...........

 Hi, For the Empty Box we'll put some Breaking news ... the news could be anything... anything about us/our friends or any links to some actual happenings around the world/us... we can send any breaking news we have using the contact link to jax and he'll put that in its place... this is different from the Blogrolling section... in this case, we'll have a coupla lines like a headline that'll carry links, not just a phrase linking to a site... this is one more opinion for the count... Ganja... reliance offer oothikicha... DAE offer enna aachu... BusinessWorld 'la pottu kizhi kizhi nu kizhichuttaan...The weather is pleasant here too in the past week or so... Valli... I'm not an avid novel/story reader, but one thing I would say is... if u understand everything in a story then its not a story... u should not understand them, still it must make sense... (whatever that means)... so I think jax has scored on this point... and its good to see two thangachis fighting for their beloved annas... (but the annas never seem to bother...!!)...

 Hi , The surprise wave did not stop with Valli alone......ya...Ganesh anna called me as well....and had a good chat with kavi....as Valli said, the pleasure of talking to our friends is just beyond limits! the weekend was good....on saturday...once again we went to Leicester.....rather call it mini India....just amazing to c how the whole city is flooded with Indian population......i expect boomi to go bankrupt in the near future.....got a white gold mixed stud...part of my b'day gift package!...then went on to get some Indian sweets....' Rasa Malai '......just toooo gud. hey valli......just be careful ok....yarayum bayampuduthi datha....anda gundan pavam!!! Kishore...having masti.....enjoy... jax....manny....what happenned?? no posts? any idea what sangee is upto??? bye

 Hi, It was a great show on Saturday. To describe the least - Creativity at its best..!! As the music show by a group called Vinapra started, it sent every nerve racking. We jumped on to the front of stage and started dancing (well, almost) and jumping and howling. I can still feel the vibration in my bones. Then a DJ started playing remixes after remixes and it was an electrifying environment with smoke and disco lights. And for once, nobody reminded themself of their gender. After all the weekend merriment am looking forward to this friday when I'll be starting my week-long vacation covering rini's marriage in Madurai to spending until the next weekend in Chennai.

 Hi, Today I chat with sindhu after a long time. It’s a great surprise for me. It’s nearly been 10 months I talked to sindhu…Jax,Why can’t we arrange a group chat soon???I am eagerly waiting for rini's marriage to meet you all. Here in chennai since I am staying in a new hostel. I am missing all my old hostel friends and it's boring here at times. Yesterday I went for shopping..spent a lot in sarees. I was in T.Nagar for the whole day.I met few of my friends.We planned to go for 'Sangamam' infy music show.But we cudn't find time. Today just I am relaxing.TV in our hostel is not functioning properly..so I came out to check mails. Valli, it's great to hear all your stories. It reminds our college days. Enjoy!! Hope you have to manage your time now . Managing b/w cooking and reading!! What’s the timings for your course?? Then how you commute to your univ? Rini,How is the preparations are going? Hope you are enjoying all the marriage rituals..Have a Nice time! I will be coming to mdu on Sunday morning. I had a project party on Wednesday in Residency..It’s was nice .We took few snaps..I will put few of my snaps in yahoo groups soon. Really it’s a great idea to have database…We can contact anyone ,wherever we are. Just now I updated my database. I cudn’t participate in all the initiatives since I don’t have net access. Let me know if I can do something for our groups.. See you..

 Hi all, got the cinfirmation from CP. I have to join on the 14th of July. So hoping resign from reliance after getting the salary and planning to enjoy the 2 weeks. have to go to chidambaram. it's been long i last went there. ajayan has come to chennai. will meet him today. bye

 Hi, In office today. Not much by way of work... but need to make some arrangements for our team for Dhun , which is a Hindi word meaning "Rhythm" - thats what the Infy, Bangalore's cultural show is traditionally named. It seems this is the 4th Dhun . Though I'm not taking part in any event, I've volunteered to volunteer in the behind-the-screen activities for our team. After all, they are as important as the on-screen show-offs, ain't they... The 32 buildings here are divided into 5 groups of 6 buildings (2 groups will have 7)... and it will be a contest between these groups. All the usual stuff like dumb charades, quiz - General and film, skits, dance, fashion parade etc., and also an exclusive show by some music troop at the end of the day... Heard some VJ is also coming for that music show. It is scheduled to be from 3PM to 10PM later today... Looking forward for that... As I was walking past the amphitheatre-like designed stage where hoards of big Hi-Fi speakers are getting installed, I've already begun to feel the chill of it. As of now, I'm just ralaxing and cooling myself off hearing what has become one of my all-time favorite songs - "The winner takes it all" by Abba.

 Hi, I had a pleasant surprise from Ganesh.K yesterday.....he called me!!!!.....we were talking for abt 10 mins.....it's really awesome to talk to one of our good old friends, after quiet a long time....

 Hi friends, I will b on leave from monday, but then i will try to browse and keep myself intact with the bloggers. By the way yesterday We bought a gift to my parents! Simple gold plated Watches from Titan. From the Day one since i joined this job, i never sent them even a single penny and so i thought let me get something special for them atleast in the sake of my wedding. I dont know what would be my parent's reaction, though i have told my dad before hand, its my Mom's words which i think i will have to face. so i am planning to release the gift only on the day of my wedding so that they cant tell me anything! Ok guys i will also upload the route map to the Wedding hall on to our groups file section. So u can refer that for further details. bye for now

 Hey everyone, we can earn money through our blog. Google allows it. Read more about urlLink Google AdSense . Don't expect thousands of dollars through Google ads. Adios.

 Hi Jax, By way u can remove all my subscribtions to msitmmb groups except my yahoo id..... Thanks Nothing more to type..... will update u later....

 Bon jour, I was going through the members list in msitmmb. There were a few ids which were bouncing. I have decided to remove those ids and then re-subscribe them. I also noticed that a few of us have subscribed using multiple ids. I know I am repeating it once again. But please use the Yahoo id alone. So, Ramgopal (3 ids), Vijay (2 ids), Manny (2 ids), and Valli (2 ids), please change your preferences to your yahoo id. I am willing to extend any help in this matter. Let us be an example of an interactive group. Expecting your cooperation. I have decided to involve myself in the msitmmb group again. Since Rini might not be able to find time during the next few weeks, I decided to continue the work. Other than that, got a lot of office work to do...

 On to another weekend. Will be coming to office tomorrow. Partly for some work but mostly to attend Dhun - the cultural show. HRD has told we can only bring our spouse and children for the show... None others... But where do I get for one... ;-) Gosh, I guess I have to come alone... It seems Kavi has got her mike and headfone. So, looking forward to some "talking" with her later today. Last day for rini in her present realm. When she's back its gonna be a different rini (I hope). Surprisingly, I'm making steady progress reading the book "Conversations with God" that I got last week. Its more in the wavelength of my definition of God, Life and living. Really enjoying that stuff...

 Dear Ram, Can u translate ur holy parable to English so that ordinary mortals like me can comprehend a thing or two...??

 dai mahendra, I was happy with the result on that day after the interview in CP. But i did not control my emotions as u had said da machan. what is there afterall colgate is also one of the company as there r 100's of them. tomorrow if some other company gives good salary than this i will definitely go there. see u know me that i do not jump over when something good as happened & also i do not brood over when something bad has happened also. it has been my character,so u cannot change it. then athu ennada after every line u say hahahaha enna yawn panriya venna bye

 Hi da, Manny, I wld like to know more about your job da. Dei, Ganja, Ennaku eppa treattu? Where is Sangee and Vijay, no posts from them at all. also Rajesh.

 one running mistake...to after thanks in my previous post has to be deleted ...sorry. ha ha.

 Thanks to for welcoming me ranjini and ram…and yes…congrats ganja…this is my formal congrats apart from the one I said to u in person…ha ha. We had a nice time here when bala also joined us during his visit for this CP interview. We were kidding ganja and really ganja was so happy that day when he was almost confirmed in CP but he was not ready to outburst and show his excitements before us. I inferred that from him and bala too…and we both started pulling his legs and were kidding. We had a drink that night and While we were having our drink we had it by hiding it from ganja using a towel…(namma tamil padathula ellam mariyathaikkaga thunda vachi marachikittu kudippanga illa….antha maathiri…ha ha…sice ganja is no longer the same old ganja and now he has become the STS (Sales Territory Supervisor) of CP, he deserves this mariyathai…ha ha ha.) And then, valli, kavitha ennai emathitta….Le’Meridien polamnnu sollittu, Kerela Shansikku kooti poitta…ofcourse athuvum nalla hotel thaan…but when compared to Le’Meridien…it’s a small one…but naan nalla thaan saapitten…over’a saapittathula…vaanthi vara alavukku aayiduchu….ha ha ha… apram athu epdi…niraya pasangalukku mudi kotti asingama aayiducha….hmmmm…neram… Ok cute boys and (not so) cute (MS ITM) girls…nothing more to pen. C u later. Mahen.

 Hi, Just edited the work place of some of our class mates. bye

 Deai.. Kicha.......... Overaaaa??? aluttta thaye... Xavier Mention pannum bothey... Nee, Bala & Jax Yodaya... BBS thaan Thoonuchie... Well done Jax, It willl be of great help for me... I hope, Cheers

 Oh!! Man!! jax is taking me down the memory lane. and for those who cannot decipher wat he meant by asking me to look on top-right... here's the story... Once upon a time in a place called Madurai there was a campus where people used to study. (atleast... that was what they were supposed to do) ... And there were two little people called Hem and Haw... er... jax and kicha... who were soo proactive that they wanted to do a project that emobodies the future... And so their hunt began... In the meantime, they understood the significance of XML standards and chose the XML-Signature as their project... or rather, an implementation of XML-Signature using C#... it was with great difficulty and hard work that they completed the project... after all, searching in google ain't that easy... ;-))

 Hey everyone, An easier way to blog. Take a look at urlLink this . I haven't tried it out yet. For our blogger developers, here is a question. habe you met the XML family of specifications? If not, now is the time. Meet them urlLink here . Kicha, remember the one on the top right corner?

 Hi all, Thanx for all your congrats. In colgate they have offered me the job. but it will be confirmed only when i pass the medical tests,took them yesterday.

 Hi, There's a cultural event this saturday here in infy. It seems it happens every year around this time. But this year due to some "unavoidable circumstance" ( Dilberto diplomatico ) they are not allowing family/friends... :-(( Just thinkig if I can volunteer to volunteer. After all, its not often that we are going to see dance and masti... PS: Dilberto diplomatico means as diplomatic as "Dilbert" cartoons. And you won't find that phrase in any dictionary.

 Good job, Valli. But I didn't know Deepa was born in "1079". She must be around 924 years old by now. I've updated my records, phone no et al.

 Hi all, The trip was nice....happened to meet all my immigrant relatives....we did go to the Devon st....had lunch in the uduppi hotel.....masal Dosa....wow!! i still feel the taste...we don't have any south Indian restaurants here in Lexington.... Xavier, I updated the missing guys & the gals in the groups database today.Courtesy was our souvenir. so i don't know how accurate the info is .

 Rini, will try to do it this sunday. if anyone else can do it before sunday, they're welcome. When will you be at Mdu? I'll call you home. Long time since I heard you talk. Came back in the afternoon. got a lot of mails to check and reply (official). Will tell you about my travels tomorrow? Congratulations to Ganesh, Expecting your treat on Rini's wedding.

 Hi jax, i think u might see this post today evening, ya go thru the contact list i have created in our groups section. Kindly if u r free, add info of missing friends like sam and bala. as i dont have souvenir, i collected info from slam book. so theirs isnt there as they havent signed in mine. so update theirs from the souvenir. If not jax, those who have the souvenir can also do that. similarly update the calendar also with the birthdays of missing people. I found around 6 person's info missing in my slam book. As i havent worked on girls i cant quote whom i had missed exactly. Friends suggestions are welcome to make any changes to the database from all the bloggers! I snatched sometime to do this task before i go on for leave, coz this is a task which i had promised to do earlier but has made it only now. And if possible, its better to influence our friends to sign in with yahoo id to access all the features. So bloggers who havent yet subsctibed up with yahoo id to our group, kindly do it! and i have posted my invy to all. Valli i have posted to ur inlaws address properly dee, sindhu to ur parents address as u dint revert me with any change of address. I dont have balachander and sam's address. Can anyone, mail me theirs? And sandil's address too, coz i have only madurai address.

 B R E A K I N G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N E W S . . . Ganesh is into Colgate-Palmolive... Just talked to him. Ganja is selected in Colgate-Palmolive. That increases C-P ppl to two. Wow! Now we have more than one person in all major domains - IT, Telecom, FMCG, BPO, Insurance ... The Indian economy is in our hands...!!!

 Had a long day yesterday. Went on a location finalisation with my CEO and a couple of others. Started from office at 10:00, came back by 9:00. Clocked up almost 200 kms yesterday. Went to a lot of places. Interesting places. I have to go there today also. So I'll be back by evening and post my travels later.

 Helllooooooooo..... anybody out there... prrr...prrrrrrr..... (whistle, a la Titanic) can anyone hear meee......

 Hope everyone had a fine weekend. Waiting for your weekend stories. Myself, nothing special. Chatted with Kavi for some time. Wated "Nala Dhamayanthi". It was a funny and interesting film to watch, especially the portrayals of realities in life (plight of foreign going indians). if only more movies like these were taken by our film world.. I may not be able to blog today as I am leaving for a visit to a client's place. Might be late afternoon or even evening when I return. Here is an intersting bit of news: urlLink Indian boy hatches beetles . See you later,

 Had a great weekend. Murtuza and Rajesh are here... Saturday had a good lunch with ram and met them both and sinoop. And we talked and talked and talked and talked standing at the sides in MG Road before dispersing for the day. Sunday was better. Swetha and her sister joined us and we had big lunch. And then we walked and walked and walked and walked and went with Rajesh to his friends home exactly in time for a coffee, and made our way back home late at night after a short visit to rajesh's place. Me and Ramgopal, did what we have come to do quite often now-a-days - Buy a book. Whether we read it is a different matter altogether, but it all adds up to the kitty. I got "Conversations with God" by Neale Donald Walsch. And started to read some of it. Boy!! and did I love reading it...

 Thanks for your comments and have a nice weekend, Valli. It is true I made some things up. I left a lot of clues for you to find out. I had twice contradicted myself on your comp. config. The bit about currencies. I said UG lab while an associate prg is only for graduates. I thought you would notice things like these. The vending machine part is true. There is a vending machine to your left. I said I don't know the exact distance. It might be two metres away or two thousand kilometres away. So if you keep going to your left, you might find a vending machine either in the next building or the next or the next... BTW don't follow the "keep to the left while driving". About the "IA & ID" prg, only a few universities in the world have it. Just enquiring if yours was one. Hope you would watched "Alaipayuthey". Do you remember the scene when here is a "ponnu parkkum" scene for Shalini's sister. The "mapillai"'s brother introduces himself. Remember... Read the following sentence in that style. I will be doing my masters degree in communication and journalism at Kamaraj University this year. Finished reading, come back... I wanted to tell this news earlier but I had a doubt whether I had submitted my TC and provisional to my office. Spent the last two days searching for it. Found it yesterday night only. So study for two years. My fellow MSITMians, some news for you. MKU has started M.Phil courses in Computer Science this year. Guess what, MSITM is eligible. So those of you willing to do thier M.Phil, you've got three options, -> M.Phil. Computer Science - Fees: INR 12000, payable in lump or two installments (6250 each). -> M.Phil. Management - Fees: INR 6000, payable in lump or two installments (3125 each). -> M.Phil. Entrepreneurship - Fees: I don't know All above courses are of one year duration. The applications are being given, INR 200 by post or INR 150 in person. My MCJ (Master of Communication and Journalism) fees are a very paltry for a two year course - INR 1985 per year. The SW monsoon has begun, they say. It is raining here. Sorry, Drizzling steadily, not raining heavily. I started from home to my office at 8:03, a distance of 1.5 km or 1 mile. By the time I arrived at my office, I had -> escaped skidding off on three to four occasions -> missed hitting two to three persons who choose to come in front of my vehicle instead of the lorry coming behind me -> refused lifts to atleast one person. Arriving at the office, I have to be careful as the mosaic floor put up in front has a tendency to remind people of friction. Many people have understood the laws of physics on that floor, especially on rainy days. It doesn't end there. I run up three flights of stairs up to my office and then swipe in my id card. The time would be 8:05:54. I made it with five seconds to spare. A week had conme and gone. So what are your plans for this weekend? Mine is as usual, church, browsing, computer or tv. If anything interesting happens, I'll let you all know of it. Yesterday, my net connection was down since afternoon. It still is at the time of composing this. Malaiikaga browsing centre pakkudhilla odhungunaen, I saw my friend there. She had come to see her results. She read out Valli's post to me. She seemed interested in our method of communication. As we make multimedia CDs, I develop the content for voicevers that come in the cd. The irony is that the person who does the voiceover gets over 10k for half an hour's reading while the poor developer (myself) get only a fraction of that amount. more from me later,

 Hi, Good morning. hope all will be enjoying ur week end... for me today is a working day. only 2nd and 4th sat are holidays. and thanks a lot for ur welcome quotes...and valli, hindi is our national language...y shudnt i use it? when u know english u shud try to know hindi too...at least try pannu....ha ha. nothing more. enjoy ur trip to chicago. i am going to have a treat tomorrow with kavi i hope probably, exclusively for me...ha ha for the infy offer that she got...innaikku varaikkum emathikitte irukka ava... may be tomorrow i'll have my lunch at Le'Meridien...uuhhhhhh!. bye bye cutys. Mahen.

 Hi, Valli, lemme try with my predictions... u r using a computer to access the net... u type using a keyboard and u use a mouse for moving thru the screens. You typed all ur words with the fingers in ur hands... u were facing the monitor when u were typing things out... at times u don't look at the keyboard while typing and at times u look... and while this entire process was going on, u were constantly and continuosly doing one thing - breathing... ;-))

 hey Xavier, It was interesting to read all ur predictions man.....u were going on the right lane, but suddenly drifted, & started predicting wrong...... You use a Win Xp with IE6 : right used AOL to view the blog : right, i always use AOL to hook up to the net You accessed the blog somewhere around a university : Based on which date was this prediction made?....Library is near the Univ, But i went there a couple * of weeks back I'm going to do A.S in University of Ketucky.....& i guess CalTech is California Institute of Technology....California is nearly 2400 miles from my place..... we don't have any street named San Pasqual Street, Pasadena. Cross checked this with our Lexington maps too....Ofcourse, i've a printer near me & i'm facing the printer.... appuram indha Vending machine ellam buruda dhaana???.....how can u predict a vending machine man?....yaara aemaatha paakkura?.... I'm not sure if they offer a course in "Information Design or Architecture"? in CalTech....But there's a department called IMD(Infomation Management & Design) in UK(Univ of Kentucky) & a web designing course in Sullivan Univ(private), Lexington...... It was a good start man.....continue to practice this art.... Happy week end Guys..... shld pack up things for our journey...starting off early this afternoon.....bye...

 Valli, where have you planned to do your Associate degree in Computer Information Systems? CalTech? Ok, here is some information. I may be right or I may be wrong. Anyway, I tried. You use a Win2k machine with IE5? BTW, does your ip address begin with 216.52.229? You access the net from Jorgensen Center for Information Science. It is situated on San Pasqual Street, Pasadena. The Jorgensen Center for Information Science (Building No. 80) is the under graduate computer science dept. computer lab of CalTech. Interestingly, the computers are named after currencies there. If the above info is correct, read on. There is a printer near you. If you are facing the printer, there would be a vending machine to the printer's left. I don't know the exact distance but it is there. Valli, tell me how correct was I? Awaiting your reply? Also Valli, could you find out if they offer courses in "Information Design or Architecture"? "Reality no longer has the time to take on the appearance of reality." &nbsp; Kicha, I will get back to your post soon. CSS link(opens in a new window): urlLink www.w3c.org

 Sad to hear Valli's plight... she's going to school after completing college ;-) Was just thinking of what cud be our next topic for discussion. The previous topic on "carrying-over" traditions got some response from ony 3 or 4 people. It's great to hear varied view points about many ideas and it all surely adds up to our wisdom and our ways of thinking. The discussion on M:R cud not have got much response as many might not have seen it... One interesting link I came across y'day... Not sure how many of us are aware of it... but if u have really known the source of our national anthem, then u can check the validity of what is below. Check out this link on urlLink national anthem and do share ur views.

 Kavi, Sorry, forgot your new posting. Actually i thought I had typed in Chennai. seems I goofed up. I'll correct the same. Valli, thanks for posting your message. Well let me try yours then. You accessed the blog somewhere around a university. You use a Win Xp with IE6. Am I right? You can just say, 'Yes' or 'No'. i'll try to find out the details myself. A few days ago, you used AOL to view the blog. right or not? I'll tell you more tomorrow.

 Hi, It's been long since I met you all in blog.Here I don't have net access whole through the day and after 5 also it's so slow.That's the pbm.Rini,your invitation is nice. Jax..In bio what's the comment you put for me? I am not posted in blr..I am in chennai. And also there is a pbm in blog I think as valli said,I typed my post yesterday I click post..it's all gone.I also have to use notepad I think. Valli,It's nice to hear u r going to do AS.Have a Good Start! See you all tomorrow, Kavi

 Hi Jax, I can always send it the second time Jax....It was just a small disappointment yesterday....that's it.....Maybe, i'll also use notepad in the future... Welcome Mahendran!!!......expecting lot more interesting news from u.....Adhukaaha, hindi la ellam type pannina....India vandhu udhaippaen....either convey it in the Universal Lang or our mother tounge man.....convey my wishes to ur sis.... this's what i was trying to post yesterday..... I've planned to go to school from this summer.....I'm going to do an Associate degree in Computer Information Systems....this's a 2 yrs course....classes r starting from next wednesday..... I can take only 7 credits in summer....but still, it helps me finish off the course as soon as possible....Initially we had opted for M.S....But, know what.....even the deadline for 2004 spring is over....so i can do M.S only in 2004 fall.....but there's more than an yr's gap inbetween....i cud finish off A.S by then & get into the work stream..... So guys, if somebody's planning to do M.S here.....think far ahead, so that u don't waste ur years & age..... Hey sindhu, this "Toll system" is existing here for nearly a decade or so.....in almost all the metros......I doubt if that's going to be a reason to reduce the percentage of traffic......here they do that for revenue......For all of us, there's the federal tax & the state tax.....But for people in metros the Govt collects a city tax also...this toll system is a way of collecting city tax from both the stagnent & the floating population....But ofcourse, US is really weak in public transport systems....so maybe in UK it may act as a traffic reducing agent...... I guess, this system already exists in India......For ex, I"m not sure....but just recollect.....on your way to Pazhamudircholai from Azhagar kovil, they stop us & collect money & give back a reciept...remember???....that's ofcourse a toll system....maybe a manual toll system, unlike here....This's just an example.... Actually, i shld have quoted a freeway or a state highway...but since i did'nt know anything in particular, i'm saying this... hey Rini,.....great that u were able to get three weeks off from ur work...... this weekend we are going to Chicago for an Engagement....The bridegroom is my cousin & the bride is Ganesh's Cousin......looking forward to have a great time, after a very long time....It takes nearly 8 hrs to reach Chicago from our place......This's totally a family get together...so we'll not have much time to tour around Chicago this time....but i'm waiting impatiently, just to see one place...the Indian bazaar there.....One full road, with boards & signs written in hindi, tamil, telugu...It's typically our Renganathan st, it seems....inclusive of kai aendhi bhavans .........poor Ganesh is trembling to take me there....'coz i've been making a list for the past one week...& i wonder, the list never seems to end....i still get things in my mind, to purchase every now & then.... Xavier....trying to become a cyber detective?....nice to read all ur guesses...but why is that, everytime, u end up in either guessing Kicha's machine or Sindhu's?.....if u continue to do this....i'll have to conclude that it's an agreement b/w u & those two...try to guess something else man.... bye

 Hi, Ranjini, ur invi looks great....so..how many months u r going to be on leave??? Welcome Mahendran....convey my wishes to your sister.... still no sign of sangeetha yet??? hey Jax, If I get into posting the receipe for kesari, we will definitely get ' hits ', but not the one you are looking for. They have introduced new system in London and in few heavy traffic motor ways...called ' Toll system '. It means we have to pay for every mile we drive during the peak hours, in the most congested areas. Soon they are planning to extend the system in all major cities in UK. It is believed to rduce the traffic by 19%. The transportation system is good here, in particular the tube rails in London. So this system will make people to opt for public transportation instead of cars. It has a good success rate as well. I was just wondering if we bring in the same system to India...how far will it be effective in reducing the traffic?? cheers

 Hi cute chaps and gals, How is life? For me it’s all work and no play kind of thing these days…”Kya karna? Koi paane ke liye, koi kona hi padtha hai na?”…ha ha. Hope it’ll take few more days to get into the stream of blogging…. I hope kishore Gopalan is in his full swing in the blogger…ha ha. My days are fine and rolling on here at chennai. Had a nice time with all my “Natpu Thozhargal” during my sis marriage at trichy. Really its all the moments of enjoyment after a long gap, that too with all my chaps, or rather I wud say, my kith and kins who had their time to spare with me in my sis marriage. I will send u the snaps of the moments later...even I haven’t seen them yet. Ok cutys, bye bye, Will get back to you people later… Mahen.

 Valli, I noticed this before. I presumed it was something at my end, (the pages being retreived from my machine's cache). Actually, if you hit the Post button, Blogger stores your post. It doesn't publish the post. It gets published only when someone like me hit "Publish all recent posts", which I often do. You should hit the "Post and Publish" button, which you might see if you are using IE6 on the top corner. Otherwise you can go to the publish status tab. If it shows "no posts published in this session". hit the publish recent button. Everything would be fine. If you're still facing difficulties, let me know. And if you can remember what you have typed, please type your four paras for us without considering the pain. Valli, I also have lost quite a number of posts like you did in the past. So I came up with a solution. I usually type my posts in Notepad and Copy it and paste it in the post window. That way, I don't lose anything because of vagaries of the Internet. What happened to the others? Still waiting for Sangee's and Manny's first posts...

 hey Xavier, wat's happening man?....see i had just now typed four full paraghs & hit the post button....Everything's gone!!!....i'm not going to repeat that now immediately....

 Read the 2nd para in my previous post as... Now, if it was false, I shud be hanged. In which case my statement wud become true and I shud be beheaded...this throws up yet another paradox...

 I wud say "I will be hanged"... Now, if it was true, I shud be beheaded. But then, my statement wud become false and I shud've been hanged... this throws up a paradox... Now, if it was false, I shud be hanged. In which case my statement wud become false and I shud be beheaded...this throws up yet another paradox... btw, I'm in Electronics city... but PIN code is 561 229 and not 562 158...

 " Within this realm of choicelessness, we do choose how we live ". - Joseph Epstein Hey, here is something for you to think about (today or tonight): "A prince has put a law on poaching in his land. Poaching is punishable by death. In order to give the culprit a choice, he decreed that anyone caught poaching will be given the privilege of deciding whether he should be hanged or beheaded. That he can choose his mode of death. The person was permitted to make a statement. If it was false, he would be hanged; but if it was true, he would be beheaded." Consider yourself as the culprit. What would you do? Expecting your answers and your explanations for the same...

 Kicha's office is somewhat closer to your address........... (may be the same) Couldnt post anything spl. but enzoying the updated blogs if at all there is something spl... bye Ram

 Ranjini, Ram, whose office is at: Software Technology Park- Bangalore, Block III, KSSIDC Complex, Keonics Electronics City, Bangalore 562 158. Kicha or Kavi, who is using Netscape 3?

 Ram, your link doesn't take me anywhere. On going through the site, it seems it uses 'pop under' technology. Frankly, I hate 'pop-unders'. They irritate me. So would you like three to four pop-under windows to be shown whenever you visit the blog. So, can't use it for the blog, da. BTW, What happenned this weekend, No news from anyone? I've updated the bio's slightly. Still waiting for inputs from you all... last night, watched "Behind Enemy Lines" for the third time.

 There seemed to be some problem today morning with blogger. Got some webserver errors. Now it's fixed. There she goes again... Come back soon , Rini. As for the blog layout, check that link now. I forgot to add the customary "http://" in front of the link. Manny has joined us... So time to update the bios. Someone prepare a short bio on Sangee and Manny. I'll include it in the blog. Bye for now.

 Guess what this quote is about and by whom? "It's about the search for identity, the struggle of life, trying to find out the mythical themes of the messiah, of the lovers, of the teacher, of the shaman. It's such a great platform for how we can sometimes think about our own lives." Sangeetha has joined us in this blog. Welcome to the blog, Sangee . Waiting for Sangee's first blog... The blog strength has increased to eleven. I have added Mahendran. Is mahendrapallavan at yahoo his mail id? If I'm wrong, someone inform me asap. BTW: the above quote was given by Keanu Reeves when asked what the Matrix Trilogy was?

 Ranjin, just saw your invi, looks great. Any chance of reducing the size of the invi. You have just scanned it and uploaded it.&nbsp; The front page is 1003x987 pixels (size 236 kb). Invitation: 1011x974 pixels, size 120 kb). You could saved a lot of bandwidth by reducing the size a little bit. Just a suggestion. Waiting to get my hands on the hard copy shortly. Kicha seems to trying something . Good. I've got a new design lined up for the blog. You can see the original version urlLink here . Not heard from the others for a long time, esp., Ram, Valli, Rajesh &amp; Vijay.

 Does marquee work in the blogger... Now I know...

 BREAKING NEWS... US outsourcing ban legally valid: experts Before independence, patriotic emotions were running high in India on being “swadeshi” and “be Indian buy Indian” etc., as we were craving to save ourselves… Now… its America’s turn to panic…!!!

 HAPPY FATHER'S DAY... and this is how google looks today... but why is the father shown to be sleeeeeeping....

 Back after a sober weekend. In fact, didn't have more than 2 hrs of work on saturday. I just came to while away some time. The weather was a beaut that day. I joined with a coupla my friends and walked around the campus. It was such refreshing. Saw M:R in the evening before going home. Could make a lot of sense watching it first time itself, as I had already read a lot of reviews. Its really a unique deal with fiction. And to realise how much truth a fiction could radiate, u need to watch that film. If u also concentrate on the conversations there's a lot more to enjoy. Some conversations are still lingering in my mind... "You see only what you choose to understand" "Comprehension is not a requisite for cooperation" Neo to the Oracle: "You already know my choice. How is it a choice then? What if I do not choose?"... Oracle: "Even that is making a choice" and lot more...

 Bala had come to my office just a few minutes back. Said he would be coming back to CBE tomorrow. Briefed me about the gathering at Manny's sister's wedding. Have a lot of questions to ask him when we meet tomorrow. So kicha, how aws your first Saturday at work? American Style Saturday or Tamil Saturn-day?

 And talking of laws... just came upon an interesting one... The "Law of perversity of nature"... The chance of the bread falling with the buttered side down is directly proportional to the cost of the carpet. Any comments...

 BTW, the discussion laws aren't real. I just made them up.

 Hi, To add to jax's view on discussions... Just like I had mentioned as my views, in one of my earlier mails, every entity that is part of nature will undergo transformation and death. "Discussion" is just another entity in nature. And its bound by the same laws that bind every other entity. The "process" of discussing is another entity and its going to have its own tranformations and end. We notice this at the very basic levels of interactivity. Ans its in nature to transform whatever it binds. Given this, its nothing surprising that our discussions take different forms at different times and sometimes come to an abrupt halt or take a different direction altogether.

 Hi all, Got time to blog. Following is the description of our enjoyment in Manny sister's marriage. Rajesh.Vijay & myself started off to Trichy on Tuesday evening from Koyambedu. all of us started to eat the chips & biscuits which vijay had bought. as usual after Chengalpattu Rajesh started meddling with his cell phone. both vijay & rajesh did not allow me to sleep at all. reached trichy at 1 at night. found the lodge which manny had booked and found ajyan,bala,sam,sandil,vinoth kumar & manny already boozing.since it was late they had already started the party. i got only 2 rounds of our favourite "Old Cask". Vignesh came at 4 in the morning.went to sleep a short while later.ram & murtu came in the morning while we were still sleeping. got ourselves ready & went for the marriage at 8.30.had a nice breakfast. immediately after the marriage ate our lunch & went to the room to continue our sleep. ajayan,vijay,ram & bala went to Srirangam. woke up in the evening & went to Mapillai's house at BHEL to have the feast which it seems is a custom. since the mission of having free food was completed (hihihihi) each one of us started to our respective places.manny,vijay ,sam & myself started off to chennai. that's how it went. then saw "Nalla Thamayanthi" on Thursday. Witty movie with lots of humour. But the best part comes in the last 5 minutes of the movie when my "Thalaivar Kamal" comes with the "Sandiyar" costume. Unknowingly I started shouting "Thalaiva". Just could not wait to see the movie. hope it was not boring bye

 Ranjini had asked why our discussions all 'go to den'. Why? My take on the issue: Rini, It is difficult to maintain the same level of thinking right through a discussion that too a discussion that is interspered with lots of interferences in the form of time zones, geographical boundaries and other things. Why, it is difficult for people sitting face to face to continue a discussion for more than two hours. Tell me what end should a topic be discussed. The Third Law of Online Discussions says "There will be a death of the discussion after a point of time." The corollary says that after such an event, it is not wise to continue a discussion. If this law is not valid, we would still be discussing about the "which came first, the chicken or the egg?". Hope you get it. Is it interesting? Maybe we should try a discussion on "the effectiveness of harakiri vis-a-vis other traditional self killing methods" or "the correlation between lunar orbit and the growth of deep-sea anemones". Both seem to be interesting. If Darwin's theory could be brought into context here, you'll find that only the fittest survive or only the interesting threads survive. The Fourth Law of Discussions (also known as the Law of Threading) states that "discussions will lead to discussions". This discussion is an example. More after lunch,

 Where is Rajesh, Ganesh, and Vijay Babu? What happened at Mahendran's sister wedding? Still in a hangover? Also, what happened to Kavitha? waiting for news from her...

 And me too... for a change, travelling almost to Tamil Nadu from Bangalore on a saturday. I mean, coming to office on a saturday... (which is just 15KM from TN border and 20KM from Hosur bus stand). Hope u got the context. Life is another matrix. There are invisible relationships between the many visible elements of life. You always seem to be understanding things but still never understand anything. Hindu philosphy calls precisely this, as "Maya". The Vedas state that whatever is happening all around is Maya, a dream which Lord Vishnu sees as He sleeps. Maya, as a concept, is both fluid and unstable. It exists but, at the same time, it is fictitious. This explanation is analogous to The Matrix philosophy, which states that we live in an illusory world and only an unplugged/awake world is the real world. In the movie, Neo, Morpheus and Trinity often leave the real world behind and, by computer wizardry, enter the Matrix. But it is not their physical beings, but their mental projections which fight all the battles. This recalls the Vedanta concept of ‘mithya’, the belief that only the Almighty is real. As jax put it, Matrix (both parts) abounds with theological references and has a deep profound meaning than what looks at first sight. Hail Matrix...!!!

 Sorry, couldn't blog much for the past couple of days. I ws very busy working. yes, working after a very long time. Might be doing the same today. Will check the blog often and update if possible. To understand movies such as The Matrix needs a lot of understanding and concentration. For example, in Matrix, Neo's room number is 101. Consider it a binary number, 101,. When you translate it into decimal, it becomes 5. The binary series starts with 000, not 001. So the sequence would be 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111,..... 101 comes as the sixth element. Now consider Matrix: Reloaded, Neo is told by the Architect that he is the sixth anomaly. See the connection. Another example of Matrix's deep meanings, the number plates of the cars used by major characters in the movie are all Bible references. The first two characters consist of the book name, the next two numerals, the chapter name and the last two characters, the quotation name. The quotations are related to the movie context. Saw "The Matrix" last night. saw only half of the movie. Will be continuing tonight also. To end a quote from the Matrix: "I can only show you the door; it is up to you to walk through the door" - Morpheus.

 English people are champion whiners... they whine about anything and everything... they'll like something kinda traditional and very formal stuff. Try to improvise on something and they start cribbing at you. Well, these are not my views. They were told by Sunil Gavaskar is one of pre-match conferances during the time of Cricket World Cup 1999. Also in the panel were former English players, Allan Lamb and Geoffry Boycott...!!! No wonder, "Matrix: Reloaded" is a flop there...

 hi all, Matrix: Reloaded is a total flop here......surrounded by critics......instead i would recommend ' Johny English ' ..... full fledged comedy film by Rowan Atkinson ( remember Mr Bean!).....tried to immitate James Bond in the film.....watch it if u get the opportunity.

 From the pages of our history... Time: Tuesday, June 11, 2002 Location: CED Campus, Madurai Event: Project Viva It was almost 4 months after we all had met. The exams got over on Feb 26th and slowly we parted for our project. And it was at this time that we met for once... and for last. The day when the entire class was present. No one was trying to escape out into city bunking the class... after all, we were all waiting our turn into the Audiseshiah hall/Old Lab-IT incubater to take up our viva... As people walked out with a blushing smile... there were people swarming around him/her and wondering what happened "inside". And some waiting with bated breath and turning the pages of their documentation like the last minute hunting for points to remember during the exam days... Atleast 6 or 7 cameras including one digital, that were capturing this final moments of an era. Yes, it was never going to happen again. The class to its full strength and everyone raring to have their go... With some emotional moments also... (well, not quite ;-) ) some tears from a few people's eyes... and looking back they'll now know, how silly they were to cry... and a final dose of Gowri Ganga and the famed walk thru the railway station... as the sun began to sink for the day... the noises too began to diminish... there were the really emotional touches of bidding adieu to their dearest buddies... just hoping that sometime later in life they might meet again and spend some great time as they did here... All the world's a stage. It was fortunate for all of us to have played a part together in that scene called MS(IT&M)... and now, we are off to move to the next scene and a new part to play and new persons to play with... But the impact the earlier scene has created on all of us is here to hang on to us for long. The very fact that there are still so many around to read this expression of mine, seems an indication that the scene is, after all, not over... and that the Part-2 of it is still continuing ... and may it continue for long...

 Hi all, Read all the posts....Enjoyed reading Rini's tale "The survival of Sangu poo"....I'm also trying to grow some plants in my patio.....yet to know the results... Kishore, if I'm the ruler, who condemned the murderer, i wud have given a fourth option....that room will have "Kishore" in it....there r even chances for the murderer to escape from the other three rooms, but he can't escape from Kicha's Kadis.... Nothing interesting during the week end other than going for a party...it was a pot leg get together......my contribution was "aloo kofta"..... Guess everybody is going to have a great time in Mahendran's sister's mrg....Have a great time guys.... Nice to see the site summary Xavier Instead of uploading my photos in the groups album, I've uploaded it in my own briefcase & given rigths for all the blog members. U can have a look at those with ur own yahoo ID's & passwords at urlLink http://photos.yahoo.com/vallichidambaram Waiting for ur true comments. For Sindhu most of it wud be a repetition. I'm sorry for that Sindhu. But still got to show only what i have. bye

 Sorry, couldn't update anything in the morning. I am on leave today. But I couldn't resist blogging. So here I am at a browsing centre typing this. ram seems to be onlie but no response from him. Rajesh and ganesh, enjoy your Trichy visit (jumping from the frying pan into the fire). The CSS blog will resume tommorow...

 dear friends about sangee , she is having problem in her net connection and telephone line and so she is not able to browse nowadays.it will take atleast one week for her to get it right.she will be joining us after everything is right.and i ,ganesh and vijaybabu are moving to trichy tonday evening .we will be there 2nite. an enjoyement is awaiting for us there.ramgopal ,murtu ,bala ,ajayan,ganeah,rajesh,sampath,sandil ,vinothkumar, vignesh prabu .........are meeting there after a long time.really we are going to enjoy a lot tomm. waiting for that raapi

 jax, I leave the answer open for further discussions. And about the other query. I'm open to anyone who is interested in active participation. But it shud not become like msitmmb where everyone exists but still no one gives a damn. For example, (with due respects to everyone concerned) sangee's status has been "pending" for quite a while. If joining takes an eternity then I wonder if she wud really be interested to contribute. Someone can please check with her if she's really intersted in participating. My only point is, the growth in size must not dilute the existing tenacity...

 It is a well-known fact that education is becoming costlier and costlier everyday. Commercialization of education is rampant. I could rant on and on... Everyday I listen to FM radio, the RJ would ask a telephone caller (if he is a student, what he would like to be. The answer would a default - doctor or engineer.I have never ever heard another reply, excepting an odd collector.) Why?... Because our society places a high premium on these so-called professionals. So everyone is really willing to pay whatever it takes to become one. And when people are willing, who would let go of an opportunity to make a buck or two? In the end who suffers? People like you and me (like Manny said). Oops! I forgot about the students. they are really a pitiable group. They spend so much on getting a professional qualification while losing out on thier education. How else could they pay thier debts other than turn to fleecing people out of thier money. The next time I hear someone say thier child wants to become an engineer or a doctor, I am surely gonna give them a piece of my mind. But it would be wrong to compare our education with the ones in Europe and US. There people know that they have to know something else in addition to thier professional qualifications. That is what that makes them be on top. During the recent dotcom burst, we in India cry hoarse over the nr. of s/w pros sent out. How did the average US s/w pro fired at the same time take it? He would have gone out searching for any knick-knack jobs that came his way till the tide turned. How did he bear things out? Because he might have learned it from childhood that education alone doesn't count in life. I guess you might know what counts here more. Bye for now.

 Hey jax, whatever u r doing... Half of ur previous post is coming with a "Strikeout" style... Archives could be a drop down box, and I feel 50% is less space for posts.. may be it should be 70% the least. After all, thats our primary area of concern, the others are value additions... But am not sure if any other part will be affected on increasing this size... suggest, atleast try to increase to a more possible extent... and also one more good thing would be name at the top like "Jax says...", that really adds flavor to the blog... The Rock says... If u smellllllallalalala... what the rock... iiiisss cookin....

 Hi, Regarding the blog layout I more or less feel the same as Ranjini. The archives section - I think it's better to have that as a list box. Imagine if you have some 100 archivves, the whole page will be like flooded with archives section alone. About All in a Day's work and Archives box looks too colorful (bright yellow). The blank space after Archives box also looks a bit odd. We can have a single background color for the whole layout instead of 2 colors for the RHS of blog. I feel the part which contains the blog title shd have some background color as well. will continue later... bye

 Hi, Color : Getting a right colour combination is a headache. As I had said, there will be corrections to the blog now and then. The older one was nice with just grey and white. Stil trying out various colour combinations. if you out there know of any good colour combinations, help me out. Font : The font used for the title is "trebuchet ms, times new roman, monospace". I agree Monotype Corsiva would look superb for the title. But the problem is a MTC is a cursive font, which not many systems came installed with. That's why generic fonts have been used. Anyway I'll try to add it to the title. If someone doesn't have MTC installed, then they will have to adjust with trebuchet ms or times new roman or monospace. - Fixed. Font spacing in title : I'll try adjusting the letter spacing a little bit. - Fixed. Empty space : The space after Menu box is intentional. It is present to allow resizing of the window to any size. The size of the boxes are as follows: Blog content: 50%, First sidebar (the one with the Archives section): 30%, The second sidebar (Menu, Info..): 18%. It adds upto 98%. The remaining 2% includes the empty space + paddings and margins for the other boxes. If you still don't like it, then you've got to talk to Bill Gates and ask him to improve CSS support in IE. Layout : The Layout used is known as a "Liquid layout". If I start explain about it, I would be going on and on. So the best place would be Google. Try searching for "liquid layout" including the quotes. But remember that this layout is not 100% liquid. It will liquidise upto a certain limit only. BTW, today Google has launched its India specific version @ urlLink Google India . Horizontal Scrollbar : About searching for the horizontal scrollbar, it is really funny if that happened. But the above liquid layout information might explain it better. Borders : Regarding borders for the boxes, If it is not present it gives an appearance of patches all over the blog. so it is required. Also the different color is my fault, I forgot to change the colour of the Archives sidebar. Green : It's true about the green colour. I'll look into it. - Fixed. Blog content being cornered : Actually it is not. AS said earlier, the blog content takes 50% of your screen space. I don't think it has been cornered. I woulld say that it is dominating. Centered layout : I started with the centered layout, but later on changed my mind. I wanted to put the blog content on the rightmost side, but decided against it. Menu : Menus ought to work in almost all browsers. I hope you aren't using NN4 . It might also be that the corresponding link is being displayed on the screen. Try hitting Alt+C+Enter. Does a new mail window popup? If not, inform me, I'll look into it. The best way to check out the menu is ensure that the item you need is not on the screen and then use the access keys to navigate to that module. Say you go to the bottom of the page and then hit Alt+A+Enter, the screen should focus on the About Box. Ad appearing on the top : If someone sends me USD 15 every year, I can remove the ad from there. More details: visit here . Sorry, nothing can be done about it right now. Viewing source code : Try again... If you still can't see the source code, log into blogger and click on the Template button and then the Main Template button. You still got admin privileges. Copy the template to a text file locally. I've explained a few things in the template. Go ahead and take a look at it. But please don't make any changes to the template. Counters : There were two counters on the page earlier, One showed the visitors to the page. It was present in the Info box. It is still there the last time I looked. The other gave statistics and other details. I didn't copy it to the new layout. It will be done soon as soon as I get the source code for it. Thanks for spending your time picking apart the blog and sending your suggestions, I'll try to implement as much as I could after getting everyone's suggestions and ideas.

 For more details, See Ranjini's blog...ha ha... gud rini...comprehensive coverage of the layout...gud.

 Right from the beginning and still now the education system in India has been tailored with the “One size fits all” kind of attitude, which no longer works well with the emerging global competition. This might be due to the huge population we have which prevents us from customizing the education system according to the talents of the individual. The student was restricted with limited number of choices and he has to go with what he gets…irrespective of his/her likes or dislikes. And this leads people who want something more on education to look around other countries for more prospects. For instance, there are more than 20.000 plus vacant seats in engineering colleges in our state alone. This does not mean that there are no people to opt for these courses. Rather there are hell lot of other factors such as the quality of education in these institutions and the infrastructure as well. Anna University has summoned 40 engineering colleges which don’t have the required infrastructure to make it up to the mark, that u all shud be aware of… This clearly sends a message that, the education in India is not only lagging in its value but also being commercialized. For that matter, our government has granted permission to private medical colleges and the fees per year for a medical student is figured out to be around 80k. so for five years it comes around 4 lacs. This is something which a poor or middle class people cant afford to…I feel. But I don’t get into the details of which government gave this permission and what’s the deal that went on behind the screens…at last its we who are going to suffer from the treatment going to be offered by these half made up doctors who might come out of these private medical colleges with an MBBS degree which they will get out of the money they have…ha ha. So, be prepared to go thru a newly constructed bridge that might collapse while u are passing by it and be prepared to secure your kidneys from doctors who might come out of private medical colleges…ha ha. Ok cutys…bye bye.

 dear jax, here is what i felt about the new layout. Its not as impressive as the old one. But since u have tried to inject color i do agree that it will take time to aclimatise that look. But here are few suggestions from me regarding the layout. 1. The font of All in a day's work (the title pane) is not so appealing. Please change it. It can be any one of Arial, Times New Roman, Comic Sans, Book man old style or Monotype corsiva. My vote is always for the MTC which is a bit curvical , but since all our other fonts are in straight alphabet facetype, i dont know how appealing it will look. Anyway try for various combinations and see. But change this font. I feel the spacing between the character's is more and they look hefty and short. 2. The boxes in which u are trying to fit things, doesnt appeal me. The space after the Menu box gave me an impression that the site spans horizontally beyond that box and so made me search for Horizontal scroll bar. This can be avoided, if the box is eliminated and left free. As the background u have given differs for different boxes, i dont think its necessary to have borders outside every thing. 3.That green color is a bit fluorescent and so its brightness can be reduced to make the site have a much soothing look. 4. And what is this, it seems as if the blog content is cornered. Oram kattita maathiri oru feeling. May be , its becoz of the earlier layout, i am having this. but i was comfortable with earlier layout than this. So try if u could center it, which is the center for this site too. 5. Menus are not working in my page here. What could be the problem? 6. Cant we block the ad which appears at the top of the page? or cant we position it else where? 7. Why cant i view the source? 8. What happened to the vistiors track? Ok got some work now, will get back to u when i am free Ranjini

 So things to be done: Leave some space for the blog entry Add name of the poster Bios have to be put up As for point nr. 1: I feel that the space does seem ideal, it covers 50% of the screen space. I can extend it to 60%, not more than that. Anything more than that will lead to single line posts in higher resolutions. Currently, I was experimenting to bring the menu section to the top, below the Blog Title. Almost over, I am checking it out for browser compatibility. BTW, have you tried out the access key facility for the menu, to go to the "Info" box, you can just press 'Alt' + 'I' and Enter key. That's all. Faster moving around the blog for you... This is done through XHTML . Ram, regarding the blogrolling section, as it used Javascript and took time to load, I removed it. If required, I can add it anytime you need it. Can you think of something else to put in the blog other than what was there in the earlier layout? Something new. Vijay, about Ajayan and Bala and also Kathu, I had sent them an invite to them long ago. I have not received a reply till now. So today I have resent the invitations. So someone, please help them to go through the proper procedures. What happenned to Sangeetha? She has accepted the invite, but not a single post from her yet. Could someone at Chennai look into it? A request : Please don't use too many line breaks in your post. It adds no value to your message. A one line space is ok between paras. But don't overdo it. Also please reduce the the line breaks after the end of your message. You all know that even a single space occupies the same memory space as a single character. So use lots and lots of alphabets, not empty spaces, except when required. P.S. Don'tpostmessageslikethistoavoidspacesandconservememoryspace. Bye for now,

 What happened to the discussion.. never got off... "What do you feel of our present education system..."

 to Xavier, Bala and Ajayan told me that still u havnt send invitation to them. I think last week Mahendran gave their ids in one of the post. pls do the needful. regarding layout, good work da machan. color selection is superb. i think in the earlier layout, it has the sender's name on the top.

 S Man, the blog layout is fine and good, By way... Move about & archives to right end top / bottom as suggested by kicha... What happened to bio page & blog rolling.... By way, suggest u to have the name "XYZ" Says in the Left end of the heading line.....(Title) of each post... Rest later after debugging... Hats off, Regarding, JJ & US not yet read the news... will come later with my views if possible... Cheers Ram

 Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. Suggestion 1: Allow more space for the blog posts. Working offline on the template was useful, but some issues like proper linking of the posts have to be tried out online. So I'll be working on the layout as days go by. Try finding out errrors if you can and also suggestions to improve it.

 Yeah jax, I must have tried when u were fidlding with the templete... Its fine now... and its awesome... looks really great... one suggestion... just wondering if moving the "About" and "Archives" to the right end, thereby giving more space for the text would look good...

 Kicha, I don't seem to find any problem in accessing the blog. Can you give a more specific detail. It even works in Mozilla too sans problems. Please try once again and let me know. It could've been that you accessed the page while I was fiddling with the template. Bye,

 jax, the dayswork.blogspot.com page is not opening...

 Hi everyone, As you can see, the new layout has been put up. I need your comments and suggestions to improve it further. So please send it asap. Bye,

 yeah, you are right jax. All those phrases not only mean the same thing but also convey the same meaning. Its only redundant and repeating over and over, again and again without adding much meaning to the meaning... hee...heee...

 I couldn't read the Rediff news as it is blocked at office. So could Kicha just mail the news item to me at my postmark mail id, not to my office id. I'ld be able to give my views then. Does college-time non-serious laid-back activities have any significant impact on someone who really has the potential to make it big"... Kicha, how many adjectives (that too hyphenated) are you using in tha bove sentence? Doesn't 'non-serious' & 'laid-back' more or less convey the same meaning. As you had posted about education, I feel we should be able to implement it also. More later... Busy validating the blog template as XHTML ...

 We have some new topic to discuss now. This is in the lines of the article sent by Mahendran. All of us have completed our rounds of preliminary education... I call it preliminary, because some may still have some plans of doing some course (as Valli does), but the fact that we are PGs lends enough to justify that we are done with the requisites. Having gone through so many phases what do u feel of our education system. Dr.Ravichandran, once told in our class that "we are NOT serious about education" because if we were really serious we would atleast make sure we are inside the class before it begins... And we know how we did our MS degree... My question is, "Does college-time non-serious laid-back activities have any significant impact on someone who really has the potential to make it big"... Can we say that every person WILL reach the maximum extent to which his potential can take irrespective of how/where he/she studies. Political factors have a major influence often.. but what apart from that... Is our education system really flawed...

 See what makes India students choose urlLink US for higher studies...

 I feel what Manny said is right. Every person is unique. This point is common to everyone. Maybe we can avoid political issues in this blog.

 I would like to place a humble request in general to everybody and I don’t tell this to rajesh alone…but of course this time I am saying this to rajesh in particular… Rajesh u can have your favor towards a particular political leader and u can be a sincere admirer of any personality for that matter…I don’t have anything to do with ur right to be so…. But for god’s sake, stop calling anybody with the word “AMMA” who don’t deserve to be called so…because no relation in this world is as serene and divine as your mother and its my humble suggestion that no one in this world cud be called AMMA unless she deserves it…and I feel that our CM don’t deserve to be called so. I don’t want to get further into describing her past for that matter which u all know obviously…there is a huge group of politicians all around who ought to call her AMMA…and we are not the ones to do so… This is my request to all others also who are used to call her so… This is my personal opinion and I again reiterate that its only my request to u all…and don’t get this matter hard in u…ok. Bye bye...

 Hi, hope everyone had a nice weekend. The new design for the blog is almost over. It is a bright colour. I have included several features in it. I am currently running some tests on it. But it will be ready before August (three days away). Anyone have any suggestions on anything to be included in the layout (other than pictures), please send your suggestions fast. Bye,

 Its quite true that the mother tongue is the most comfortable medium for communication. No doubt each of us feel more confortable in Tamil. But the only point is, the current state where the world is moving to, forces us to use a foreign langueage just because it is going to play a big role in earning the livelihood for many people. But having said that, if u r not living in Tamil Nadu... tell me honestly... haven't u felt a new found enthusisam when u get a Tamil counterpart - a colleague or a room-mate or a friend... doesn't ur face give a quick little smile when u see a vehicle with TN registration... and if u r not in India llike sindu and Valli... the word "tamil" always gives pleasure as its so scarce that they come across this... Even though, driven by circumstances, we are forced to use English in a lot of places that provide us the daily bread.. its always a passion and a mark of pride when it comes to interacting in Tamil... u will understand that better if u r outside Tamil Nadu... and even better if u r outside the country...

 dear friends a nice discussion is started regarding our CM Dr.Amma.i'm collecting lot of facts regarding the strike and ill send a detailled mail supporting our CM today. wait for that rajesh

 Thanks da Manny for your immediate response. The cost of education seems to be increasing day by day. Have a nice weekend everyone.

 Hi all, glad getting back to u all this time. I just want to say one thing and wind off... Once prof. Ravichandran in our Marketing class, while trying to clarify a doubt, started out with a real life example...and before giving that example...he uttered these words to the class...it went like... "Though i feel comfortable with my english, i always prefer to speak in tamil as it gives me the feeling of completeness and i would be able to bring in my expressions and thoughts in a more lively manner..." and he continued his lecture in tamil... thats what I too feel...that is, language is something that has become a part of urself... for me when it comes to the matter of language... Always THAMIZH stands first... irrespective of the other reasons such as competitiveness and Global convergence...for which we ought to be prepared...Thamizh is my mother tongue thru which i started perceiving things in this world... And yes...of course...English and other languages are always going to be there...which we cannot ignore...and get along with this world. In short Vaalga Thamizh...Valarga Em Makkal... And regarding Ms.J's so called bold initiatives... I do agree that strikes shud not be encouraged... but I wont accept the mass dismissal of 1 lac + employees in a messy manner and i wont accept the midnight arrests and harasments done to the Trade union office bearers as well... Our chief minister says that when the 98 percent of the population is facing the financial problem, the 2 percent govt employees also shud bear with the cost cutting measures... I cant find any rationale in this argument... i dont know how she was going to devote the money saved from cutting off the privileges of the employyees, for the upliftment of the 98 pecent of the state's population. Ok...these things are beyond my scope and concern and out of my control for that matter. my wishes are not going to have any impacts over the happenings...so let me be a passive listener wrt this discussion. bye bye tamils...!!!

(But i dont mean that this is a useless discussion rather...cutys!!!)

 Hi Manny and everyone else. Manny if you're interested in TW as a career, yoiu might find urlLink this useful. Also i9f possible could you or someone else at Chennai enquire about the fees & other details? I expected a few posts yesterday, nothing so far. Is this the end of the discussion, I am eager to hear what Viz Babu, Manny, Ganja have to say about the discussion on Tamil. Bye, for now.

 hi, So the discussion is stil llive??!!! it's getting a new dimension....Anyway, answering to Ram's "r u really happy with only that package"......i don't think, i can give an one line answer for this question....this can be a whole lot of another discussion, as Xavier had mentioned......what all do u need to lead a happy life?...Let me recollect Maslow's hierarchy theory......physiological, safety, social, esteem, self-actualisation needs.......Let us omit the last option for now.... we still have a long way to go for that wise & mature need....Let me try to list a set of factors kindling the other four needs.....the prominent factors i can think of are basic needs(food, shelter, clothing), security, love(need to be needed), belongingness, motivation, self-respect, recognition. Basic needs & security are highly dependent on one's financial soundness...though the other factors are still there, remember that we can proceed to those needs only if the primary ones are satisfied.....& for the other needs too, money is an indirect factor.......i don't deny that there are things other than money, one will need in life ....i miss my parents so much.....but that's life.....one fine day, nee polaippai thedi poi dhaan aaganum......Twenty or twenty five yrs from now, my kids'll will fly off from my nest......that's nature.....I still have lots & lots of thoughts going round my head abt this....tried hard to make my humble views shorter.....need to go now... need to mention this.......Bravo to our Chief Minister Dr.J.J!!.....bold decision, firm actions.....accomplished her thoughts.....strikes are in no way to be encouraged, strikes are not solutions for problems.....though it seems to be a bit rude, this's the right tonic...medicines have always been sour & at those times doctors have always been villains, but the underlying truth is, it's for the goodness of our health... see you guys...... happy weekend.

 Jayalalitha is a different person altogether. After the tactical blunder of the arrest of arch-rival M Karunanidhi in full view of television lights, the chief minister of Tamil Nadu seems to have bested her rivals in strategic power plays. She gave them rope , without herself taking any initiatives, and they have hanged themselves through infighting and confusion. In particular, Karunanidhi's DMK looks like a bloodied and punch-drunk boxer who took one too many hit to the head. Read the complete article from urlLink News u must read

 While testing a new template, I forgot to save the previous template. So if you find any quirks in the blog, kindly adjust.

 I was on leave yesterday. So I couldn't support or refute a few points said in past few days. Nice to see a lot of good points being brought up by everyone... To Valli, Good to hear that you had chosen Spanish, the second most spoken language in the mainland USA. Maybe we can have a conversation in Spanish sometime, Señora. My apologies, if my post had given an impression that NRIs are not contributing to the Indian society. As you have said, it is true that the salary is more on the other side of the fence. I wouldn't refute it. It is also true that the salaries here are not on par with the salaries there. People here too are earning that much, even freshers. But an important point that you might not have considered is the conversion rate for a US$ to INR. That is the only thing that generates the revenue. I think this topic of working in foreign lands or motherland looks good for a discussion. As for Tamil language, it is my mother tongue. I am proud of it. As for speaking in Tamil in public, I never have found it difficult. Yeah, there are times when I find it difficult to write in Tamil. It is mostly due to my wonderful handwriting ( you people might know that ). I cannot understand or recognize a single character of what I have written in Tamil, whereas somehow I can understand my handwriting in English very well. That's why I use English most often, not for me but for others to understand. Reg. Kavi's post, " They practice it here..that’s it ." You are right in saying that everyone wants to go abroad and earn. So they are practicing it here. But there are some things and certain customs that you can never practice here in India. Rajesh had wanted everyone to talk in Tamil. But there are a few words in each language that has no equivalent in the other or a ambigious meaning. Words like Love has different connotations in English whereas Tamil has various words to express it. I don't think no one uses the word " Kanipori " whenever he wants to say 'Computer' or " Innya Thalam " for "Internet". So I don't think we need to follow Linguistic Tamil in our day to day life. It is just that we limit the words alien to Tamil to a minimum. In fact the one thing that irritates me while speaking to with a person is a person frequently shifting languages. They speak a few lines in English, suddenly they switch to Tamil. Then again they switch back to English. It really bugs me a lot, just as it did bug Sindhu. When they speak in English, you are forced to speak in English, when they change to Tamil, you are also forced to change to Tamil. I really cannot stand it at all As Ram had quipped, it is not the language that is important, but the development of the nation that is important. But we can teach our children, speak to our children in Tamil. And it is our duty. So all said, it's time for me to say Bye/Vaaren/Ciao/Adios/Auf Wiederhören/Khuda hafiz

 It is believed to be India's first ever campaign to lure Indian ex-pats away from high-tech industries in Silicon Valley. The glossy brochure promoting the jobs fair in Santa Clara is further evidence of a reversal in the Valley's fortunes. Its front page boldly declared that "India is Hiring" - the subtext being that Silicon Valley is not. Read urlLink full-story .

 I agree rini’s point of view that language is used as a mean of communication. What we are expressing or learning using the language matters a lot. But most of the people will not see language as a medium, it’s been used as a scale or a determining factor for the living style or Aptitude of the person. That’s what influencing people & makes them use English even when you meet someone from your motherland. This might give the person a sense of security that ‘I am also belong to this group..’. On the other hand, People are paid off in foreign lands&this is a real case. So people out here have desire to go there& earn at one time or other. So it’s mandatory for them to use English in every day life and it’ not just ‘they want to adopt the foreign custom’. It’s a competitive world & everyone has to prove themselves in all the dimension. They practice it here..that’s it. All this contribute to the mindset of a person like ‘using Tamil in public place is a disgrace’. However It’s important to make our younger generation to learn tamil properly. But it shudn’t stop us from exploring a new language. My personal opinion is..It make no sense spending time in translating all the technical stuff from English into some language whether it is japanese or tamil. We can put all the efforts into some meaningful work which can contribute something to our society. If you remember the Time management chart which Raja sir told in our class..I put this in ‘Not important & Not urgent’ group. It’s so nice to see a blog from rajesh after a long time. I haven’t seen the mission statement which ram sent. I will see it. See you all in next blog.Bye..

 Am typing this in a typical multitasking environment... Am chatting with valli on Y! msgr... am mailing kavi and having a mail-conversation with her... am doing a "middle-man" making kavi chat with valli... am checking my mails in all my IDs... am listening to "Paint my love" by Michael learns to Rock...and am answering some questions to my teammate... Today was another very taxing day with the project... just one of those times... hmmmmmm.......

 Yes, Rini, After seeing ur blog I tried logging thru my colleague PC, its working fine, I got ur same mesg. in group also.... there is some pblm with my PC... I have to debug it... nothing more, Mahen, How ur Msn. stat. looked matchan ???? Cheers

 Ram, i have been checking mails since morning today and there is no problem with my yahoo mail.

 Good topic in rounds now. I pity Sindu wandering in want of the acquaintance of language in a foreign land. Instead of commenting on other's view, here i present my own view regarding languages. Language as such was created as a means of communicating when Human beings wanted to advance their way of communication. So as far as Language is concerned i dont have preference for any particular language though i at present i have affinity towards Sanskrit because of its usage in music. Hope u all know my recent interest in Carnatic music. It sounds divine to me. But then it has never stopped me from reading or interacting with people who speak different languages. Every language is unique in its own nature and its the convienience of usage which matters most. I remember vaguely reading what Bernard shaw said in reply to which English is the best, "The English which can be understood is the best english" It can be made generic and can be applicable to all languages. I have always felt that instead of attaching myself to one particular language let me learn to accept things which are expressed via them. So be it Sanskrit or Tamil or English or any language, its the content which is transferred signifies most and not the language, which is a mean of transfer. so friends i really feel, i am yet to discover so many excellent master pieces in various languages! Ofcourse i may not be able to master all languages to know how good they are, but ofcourse translated versions will do for me! This is my humble view!

 Great link regarding Mission statements da machaan. Thanx Mahen.

 Hey.... Does anyone faces problem with yahoo mail account... IIIar to Error 404: Requested URL not found in server.... I am trying to login with my user name and passwd for the entire day... No fruit... Let me try tommorrow... Good Day / Night as it is....

 Hai All, Welcome back Rini, Welcome, Thanks a lot for your understanding..... yes a long blog from me.... Coming to Tamil, ofcourse Sindhu is right!!!... But frankly saying Jax is Very correct...... Most of us want Tamil to be everywhere........But none of us are patriotic to Tamilnadu even to India....( IN GENERAL ) We cant compare our patriotism towards the language as like JAPANESE... They are really revolutionist... They have only Japanese as their way of commun. but still doing good, and had entered into developed nation category (as said by kicha) only because of their patriotism.... They have all the technology books available in Japanese... but where come here at TN... We cant even step out of TN within India itself... Instead of striving hard for language... strive for growth, eradicating illiteracy _ unemployment _ poverty and antisocial activities.... I Feel Hindi can be made compulsory all over India apart from First language and second language till 8th standard... After completion of SSLC first language is not at all necessary...except for those specialising over that.... But in +1 & +2 there should be debate among students on current topic alternatively in English, first language and Hindi for 1 hour in a daily basis... This will certainly improve their GA as well communication.... (if possible in college also in a weekly basis) So that they can roam freely all over the world, nation and state cheerfully.... By way we Indians are more complacent & lethargic....I recently read the book "CYCBTH"....(Guesses Please....) Author Arindham Chaudhri... such a fantastic book which speaks about Theory I Management practices which ought to be followed in Indian Orgn. Yeah Valli U r 100% Right..... But r u really happy with only that package.... if so... (after your reply) Comming to Prof. Raja Govindsamy's Classes on Mission statements.... Have a look at urlLink Own a Mission More later.... Rini, v r ready 4 taste ride but not 4 test ride.... (JK) Cheers.

 Whoooo!!! Rini's back!!.......briefing out those 21 seconds.......& starting her cooking venture!!!......how far is ur office from ur home?.... now, back to the discussion....Answering to Rajesh.....hey Rajesh i did'nt actually appriciate that party's attitude.....in tamil, we call this as "Vanja pugazhchi ani".....By all means, i was trying to express the same thing which u guys have said....go back & read my post again..... To Xavier, abt his " people have a mindset. They believe that you can be well off only if you go to foreign lands alone."......it's not a belief, it's the fact.... & to be frank, that's the only attractive force which keeps us here......"thirai kadal oodiyum thiraviyam thedu".......If some Indian coy, is willing to give us an equivalent pay cheque, i swear, we'll get back tomorrow itself.....& ideas like, "u r not serving for ur mother nation", are all, junk talks.....It's totally a win-win situation......NRI revenue, is something nobody can deny abt. But i totally agree with your concern for the future generation......yep, they'll surely be confused. It's the sole duty of the parents to clear that confusion....i know poeple who arrange tamil classes for their kids every week end....not just to read & write...but to learn isai tamil, illakiya tamil......& abt the foreign language option....i've decided to take spanish.....which is the second language here..... poittu vaaaaaraen.....

 Had a quick chat with my PL during snacks this evening... and he asked me "How's it going...", Predictably enough, I said "As monotonous as anything..." and he pipped in saying "Come back soon, I've got some really interesting work for u...!!" Yeah... I know, anything is gonna be interseting other than this project. My team is developing a framework called SPEED.NET ... It is going to be an out-of-the-box enabler for projects... I mean, it'll have virtually every utility that is needed in any project using Microsoft's Technologies. The bits and pieces for SPEED are being discussed now. My PL told me that I'll also be a significant contributor to SPEED when I get back from this (stupid) project. In fact, he asked me if I'll be able to spare 2 hours everyday amid my project to begin my work on SPEED. But I said that is impossible with this frustratingly ridiculous project. It seems SPEED will be trademarked by Infy once it gets a concrete shape. So, I could imagine its significance. Just wish I had a time machine that I can rotate and move 1.5 months ahead and start working on SPEED... ;-((

 Hi, Apologies for absconding for a while..... Welcome back RANJINI.......that was a beautiful narration... The town I live in...Hinckley....has lots of wiproites, TCS and Infosys...most of them are North Indians and Telugu's.... I was really fed up of talking to them in English with their accent....One fine day I came to know that a tamilian is residing in a nearby place.....that too from madurai......i cudnt resist the temptation to meet her....imdtly I started off to find her house.....didnt even wait for someone to make an introduction.......I barged into her house...hoping to talk in tamil...hear the words im so comfortable in......she greeted me with " hey...where u from??, ooh...from MADRAI!.....U KNOW, I SEE.....".....but the irony is i kept replying her in tamil........atlast she uttered some tamil words...just bcos i was so adamant abt talking in tamil.....i returned home with disappointment and agony! Now...im plunging into the topic as well....Tamil is our mother tongue...but how many are proud of being a tamilian.....not many.. i am sure there are people out there who think that talking in tamil in a public place or with friends, as a disgrace.....an image spoiler....it has got more or less to do with our obsession for foreign languages.....the problem lies within us....as Xavier said....with our mindset....this has to change.....the future generations should be moulded to give respect for tamil.....at the same time compatible with other cultures and languages as well... bye.

 It's so nice to hear from rini after a long time. Ohh! you started cooking also..So next time when I come to bangalore I will have a great Dinner I hope. I cudn't blog often now-a-days.Sorry. I will blog next time with more news from my side. Have a Nice time bye.

 Hi guys, Hello to every body out there! Wow i am back to work after my wedding! Days ticked off like seconds.Only 21 seconds? no it was not enough for us. Ya our wedding went on well and we had a nice time feasting and partying with friends and relatives. Good was the entire event with everything going as desired and smooth as my beloved holds my hands for ever! Yes, all the wedding snaps have come and all our friends are looking good! and ya i am yet to scan the snaps and so you people might need to wait a bit before i upload the pictures! I was happy to see many of the faces which i had seen a year back! Good was the ear ring which our friends had presented! It was a big gang ofcourse throbbing the center stage when they came to gift! Waves of laughter filled the dias with hearty wishes rising from the lips ,colorful handshakes and beaming smiles adulterated with mild tears making the moment more gripping and solid in my memory! Ofcourse it also made me pass a string of thought to all those who werent there but yet were remembering me and sending me love from far where they are! These fond gestures made me feel elated though i had shared only few moments with all of them and dint even have time to tell hi to all the individuals separately. but i could see them how considerate they were to understand me and be with me! Glad and gifted i am to have such a mob of friends. Thank you friends for making me feel so special! We went to Munnar and came back Sunday morning only.Munnar is really an exotic place for those who love nature! Good was our trip jeweled with fond memories of seeing so many flowers which i thought i might not see at all live in my days! Beautiful was our place of stay and so was my Srini too, competing with nature! To grip those moments, i have wrapped him in photos which are yet to be unwrapped from fotoshop. Hei guys, from sunday onwards, i have taken up a new venture! Guess what? Ya i started cooking , first i did Venpongal. I am not afraid, but sometime, my hand trembles a bit for the lack of experience when i add salt or oil........... They say it tasted good. I mean him, his friends, cousins and my friends and cousins. Afternoon i dint cook and we had it outside and for dinner, i prepared chappathi and srini prepared dal. It was tasty too i believe as srini told and so did i tell other friends of his! Anyway cooking comes only by experience. Yet to learn more! Once learnt i will invite u all for a taste ride! till then its bye for now!

 Hi all, Interesting to see a discussion after a long time. I certainly agree with Rajesh on many of his points. Yesterday I faced a similar problem only this time; I had to translate from Tamil to English. I found it difficult. I have not completed it yet. The political parties are making a hue and cry over declaring Tamil a national language. If it is declared so, then will other states start teaching Tamil? Definitely not. Soon we might have 30-35 national languages. Think of the country, already with Hindi as the national language, you and I cannot understand what someone from Bihar is saying or vice versa. I think those in Bang. can explain how it feels to speak Tamil in Karnataka. I really wonder how Valli & Sinduja are faring in an alien land. As Rajesh had said, it is up to us. But the problem is that people have a mindset. They believe that you can be well off only if you go to foreign lands alone. So, what they do is that they try to adopt foreign customs without understanding what they really mean. But they also want their children to be culturally attached to our values. This creates confusion in minds of children. They don't know what to follow and end up following nothing. They know neither Tamil nor English. I remember a scene from the movie 'Minnale'. Madhavan, Vivek and a few of his friends will be having a thanni party. One of them will start off in English. Then Vivek will ask him to write a leave letter. Hope you remember that scene. It starkly portrays the modern generation. That includes you and me. I know a lot of Anglo-Indians, lots of close and dear friends. I found out that most of them really follow the values of Tamil culture. They find it better than their own culture. As for Tamil as a language, No political party can lay claim to it. It belongs to the people. Bye, ØÂÕ¿ÀÓ ÀÔ¿Ó P.S. if the above line appears as junk, it is due to the problems that Tamil faces, just as many dialects being present in Tamil, there are several fonts for Tamil. I remember a few years back, there were talks of creating a unified font for Tamil, I don't know if it has been done yet. If someone knows of it, then we can use it to display a few messages in Tamil. The above line is my sign in Tamil. Bye, expecting other views from everyone.

 Politics apart... the times have changed from what it was in the earlier days. Competition is at its peak. It all depends how much versatile u could show urself off (even if u aren't that much)... Knowledge and the perceived importance of English is not just a question of knowing "one more" language but a mandatory one. With due respects to the mother-tongue, there's always a comparison with countries like Japan where English knowledge is scarce but still they are growing and are more respected economies than India. But one thing we must remember is that we did not have the same past nor a similar present. We have been dependent on the West for most of our past, and continue to do so. Some industries (like the Hardware ones) are well established there and they are the most respected manufacturers in the world. But India lacks the infrastructure to be as big in many of areas owing a lot to lower levels of education, poverty etc etc... the never ending list... So, atleast as far as the current scenario goes (which is likely to extend atleast for a few decades) we cannot afford to take our own stand simply because we are still a dependent nation to a very significant extent...

 dear friends i have been a passive participant in this blogger for a long time ,that is because of my tight schedule where im moving between bangalore ,chennai and madurai.since i have a very less time to browse ,i usually read the bloggs and logout.but now since valli brought a discussion regarding tamil i'm now spending some time in replying for that. regarding vallis words" shld complain abt this to Rajesh's edhiri katchi (who's struggling hard to make tamil as the first lang for the entire schooling for the future generations).....what do u guys think abt that?....", i will particularly and strongly say that the party which valli is mentioning has not done anything in interest of tamil people. They kindled the feelings of tamil society in 1960's and just used that to convert thier movement (neethi katchi) as a political party (DMK) and gained political mileage out of that. They protested the entry of hindi and saying that they had spoilled our tamil community. Like students from other parts of the country we dont have the courage to move or relocate ourself to any part of the country.Our generation is totally spoilled by their political stance.I guess that the next generation would be competive enough like any other in our country.It doesnt mean that evryone should study everything in tamil here to make it grow. The growth of a language depends on the growth of the society which uses that language and so the so called move made by Karunanidhi doesnt sound sensible.so i strongly condemn the usage of words "who's struggling hard " in vallis blog. And regarding the growth of tamil i do consider it as a serious problem that is to be addressed personally by us. just try if u can exactly translate and write one page of a english business correspondance to tamil? i can surely say that its not possible. i faced the problem when one of our cute lady customer in our browsing centre asked me a help .i struggled for hours and finished it (exactly because of the mental motivation provided by that cute girl).but i felt bad for not able to translate one letter in my mother tongue. our generation is not able to speak or write in tamil without using some english words in it.we have to try this from us and then we have to teach our children ,the art of using tamil and only tamil.(valli and sindu has an early chance to implement this ).we have to stop using english words when we are speaking informally. remember tamil has crossed lot of boundaries and still it has adopted accordingly and so i beleive that this language which is the oldest and finest never die, because "TAMILUKKUM AMUDHENDRU PEIR ANTHA TAMIL ENGAL UYIRUKKUM MEL" I thank valli for starting this politiced topic which provoked me to blog now. general im in chennai now and this sunday i met bala,vijay ,ganesh ,ajayan and manny here.we enjoyed a lot and there is good film "KADHAL KONDEIN" which deserves to be awarded the best .so if possible ,try to see that film and share your views in this blogger. bye rajesh Dr.PURATCHI THALAIVI AMMA VALGHA

 Hai all... after a long gap... hope u all in pink. and this is for Jax... hey these are the ids of ajayan and bala. ungalajayan@yahoo.co.in chatchander@yahoo.com Send an invitation to them... ok. and what else pals...days r rolling on...here in chennai its raining for the past 2 days. so nice to see rains these days... nice whether. nothing more from my end...will get back to u all with lot more to say the next time.

 check out the no. of visitors link.

 Valli, "tempora mutantor et nos in illis", Anyway the blog design is almost three months old. I am planning to put something more colorful here with your help (all bloggers). Regarding the information I put on the blog, i just visit a couple of sites and follow links from there onwards. A similar method is given explained urlLink here . Valli, you can't expect Tamil to be present everywhere? "Engum Tamil, Edhilum Tamil" is a just a empty election promise, which takes no one any where. BTW if you are to opt for a language of your choice, choose something like French (atleast you will be able to read the menus in the swank restaturants) or Japanese (You might improve your drawing skills). urlLink Quod scripsi, scripsi is just a reflection of my mood on that that day. I just compose it on my way to work. Select an apt phrase for it and then blog it when I get some time. I think it is a good barometer of my thoughts during the previous day. That's all. You can add your comments on it, I won't mind any type of comments on it from my friends. If you feel anything is not agreeable to you, you can post your comments there. But don't post it here please. have a stormy weekend there. All of you, have a nice weekend. P.S. I'll be online tomorrow around 12:00 IST. Hope to catch someone online then. Rini'll be joining us on Monday, I hope.

 Here's a sample lyric from the song "dating" in "Boyz" film... Boy: D-A-T-I-N-G... u and me were meant to be...yeah...I can clearly see...dating is a fantasy... Gal: Aiyyo.. love is full of pain... poda love is just a strain... Boy: Frienship enbadhu RAC.. Love confirm panna ni yosi... Gal: Friendship enbadhu full safety.. love 'il yedhu guarentee... Boy: Do u know I've been thinking all abt u, and I really want to know if u love me too...will u let me know that my heart is true... babe...when I see ur face I wanna be with u... Gal: Muga naga natpathu natpalla nejath aga naga natpadhu natpaagum...karka kasadara karpavai katrapin maraka cheivadhu love aagum... doesn't it sound very different compared to our usual songs..?? Its sounds even better with the music... Listen and Enjoy...

 A new discussion was sprouting up!!....i thought it wud grow big....but mulaillayae killiteenga!!!.....Anyway, nice never ending topic, that was.... we get thunder storms every now 'n then....Winter it is ice storm or snow storm, spring it is floods or thunder storms, summer it is tornados.....these extreme temps are really making me nuts.... Kishore, thriyaama sollittaen...mannichidu.......Infy pathi yaaru muuchu vittalum ivaru mela kaathu adikkumaam....dhoda!!!.....indha vetti bandhakku onnum koraichal illa.......kadavulae, indha kishore innum 10 yrs kku idhae project la irukkanum...... Yes Xavier, i thought of reminding u, abt the bios.....names on the LHS & bios on the RHS...does not seem to be appealing.....Anyway, waiting for the completed colorful layout.... indha lay out aavadhu konjam naal uyiroda irukkaattum......i'll check with those gals....don't know why they have'nt responded yet....& Xavier, i really wonder, how u have time to present so much everyday.....browsed ur other blog....turning out really good...continue to practise.... I'm supposed to opt for a foreign language as part of my graduation....i searched the list for tamil......but i cud'nt find it out.....kodhithu ezhulndaen.....en thai mozhi, indha mannil, oru anniya mozhiyaaga en arivikka padavillai????.....shld complain abt this to Rajesh's edhiri katchi (who's struggling hard to make tamil as the first lang for the entire schooling for the future generations).....what do u guys think abt that?.... this step is to isolate Tamil Nadu from the rest of the world...even rest of India.....to disable our future generation, making them handicapped...unfit to compete with the rest of the world...I hope this never happens.....the future of tamilnadu is not in the hands of youth.....it's now in a very old, skin shrunk, trembling, unsteady pair of hands..... happy weekend.... bye...

 I like you. You remind me of when I was young and stupid.

 now I know...

 My project is driving me crazy. The architecting and designing was done before I was assigned to this project. Now, I don't get head or tails of how to go about my coding... they've asked me to code a screen in ASP.NET ... but haven't told anything abt the dependencies like tables etc., I have to go thru the design doc and understand that... the doc runs into reams of pages... I'm struggling with it... the client timelines is also unrealistic (as in any project)... I had a talk with my PL this afternoon (my "actual" PL... not the project's PL), and expressed my anguish to him... and said "I'm really struggling...". He coolly said "I want u to get that experience...!!" I asked him to pull me back after coding gets over and not to keep me there until delivery... He told "complete the coding... we'll see..." But, I'm not the only one sturggling in the project... today the client has told to use a tool called Xpresso which, it seems, is for accessing DB... but the trouble is that Xpresso is compatible ONLY with Java... so, if the client confirms this then the whole project will have to be re-done in Java... in that case, I'll escape... coz I cannot be involved for Java coding... :)) just hoping that happens... ;-))

 Fixed the archives. But as the Members box has been moved to the L.H.S. and the bios get displayed in the R.H.S., there might be some minor positioning issues in the bio display. Any way wait for a more colourful version of the blog soon. Those who didn't understand LHS and RHS, ask Ram. Awaitng posts from Sindhu, Manny and Rajesh. Long time since they posted.

 I'm finding it difficult to get the archives section to work. I think by tonight, it would be ready. BTW, I have updated my other blog, " urlLink Quod scripsi, scripsi ". Ram, read your comments. I'll be updating that with one post everyday. So be sure to visit it everyday. News: Netscape is officially closed. There will be no more newer versions of IE Mac and IE Win (till Longhorn). Yahoo opens centre in India.

 Ganesh, If u want to share with 45, no probs carry on.... But dont make data redundant coz we (11) belong to that 45 also.... hence we dont want to see & get bored with the same messgs. also v wont abuse u saying u r not bloging at all... Frankly saying, no one is forced to blog / post mesggs in grp.., if u can, u make it, else no probs, whoever makes it, u enjoy.... By way, whoever is making should not expect that others should make it..... (2 Kicha...., Jax ur words slightly modified) according to my opinion..... Then regarding that Link JAX.... u can download the package (Claroline 1.4.2 If I am Right) and u can upload those in free websites like geocities..... and start ur own web course.... thatz what they mean... U try in the demo version, if u like it, or if u want some modification, download the PHP scripts, make changes upload in your own site... start providing webcourse, I agree that its is a tedious process, if u can find time, Try it out... Pl. feel free to contact me for any help.... I will be very free to refuse also (ha ha ha heeeeheeeheee) Maadi is kannada for tamil (Pannnunga....)

 Dear Ram, Thanks for the link, da. I had already visited the site yesterday morning itself. The trouble is that they say the demo (which is free) will be removed without notification. So I am hesitant about maybe starting a class on it. BTW what does your last line mean? I couldn't understand it. I would say that both Kicha and Ganja are right in certain aspects of thier arguments. But still I would repeat what Kicha had said about reciprocivity. It makes a quite a lot of difference in understanding the other person. It should be more of a give and take policy.

 Hi, ganesh's view that we might like to share some things with 45 rather than 11 and that everyone wud have enjoyed reading some posts like my narration is acceptable. But, my point is, when only 4 or 5 are intersted in sharing such information with everyone while the other people remain passive, it provides no boost to people like me to put up something... atleast, people must let know they enjoy certain things. We can't go on assuming everything and keep posting when there is no reciprocation from the other side... Reciprocity is a very vital factor... as a STS ganesh will know better about that...

 hi thanx for ur views. i did not mean to say that we should repeat everything in the blog in the group also.i also agree that many will not be interested in some issues as jax said. but there r some things i think which can be put in the group (eg.kicha's narration of his stay in chennai). but it all depends on the individual and as kicha had said he might not be intersted because of lack of participation in the group. but the important thing is others in the groups r missing certain information which is of relevance to all of us in the class(see if kicha had put his narration in the group many would have enjoyed reading it even though they r silent members of the group) i think u all will agree that we all want to share some information with 45 of us(atleast half of it hehehehe) rather than 11. so these r my views reg this issue. bye

 News bulletin: Two students from St John's Matriculation school, Salem have been elected to the World Congressional Youth Leadership council, which held its meeting recently at Washington DC. This was the first time that an Indian student is being elected to this council.

 I have updated my other blog, urlLink "Quod scripsi, scripsi." I am still working to get the archives section of our blog to work. Still trying...

 Jax a beaut link Xpezially 4 u urlLink Claroline enzoy Maadi Sir...........

 Jax, Its okay, not the unexpected.... coz of ur experiments..... I wont indulge myself to discuss more over the matters that cant be disscussed.... By way, if its needed to share in group / blog they will certainly share.... And Kurinji is here at blr and started his mktg in Ranbaxy....for the past 1 week....

 Due to some minor alterations, the blog layout is breaking. Please bear with me till it's corrected.

 Just hearing songs of Boyz film. I've got the songs in my system here. Very good... the songs are pretty different.. a lot of college flavor in the song... with a tinge of western-urban touch... the songs are named like "Ale Ale", "Boom Boom","break the rules","Secret of success", "dating", "girl friend" ... so that gives an idea of wat we cud expect... especially the song "dating" is tooooo goood.... the song "boom boom" is sung by Adnan Sami...

 Kicha, but it is also true that we bloggers have reduced our postings to the group. You also have accepted it. I have been seeing Ganesh and others post regularly to the group (in the recent past). I feel that the matter of relevance is very important. I suppose not many in the group will be interested in knowing that Microsoft has stopped development of IE, both Mac and Win versions or that Mozilla is better fro browsing than IE. To them, news like the above might be irrelevant. I don't know if any of the bloggers also feel so. Additionally, we forget that the blog does not occupy any space in our system, but the mails to the group consume a lot of space in your mailbox. Looks like start of a new discussion, I like this.

 I too support Ram's view. group and blog are two different entities... but if we feel that the information we want to convey need to reach everyone then he/she might post the same thing in both places... only thing is that for bloggers it wud be redundant.. but generally speaking, I don't see any reason why we need to post in both places just because people are not mailing to groups. I used to send atleast some forwards to the groups regularly until not so long back, but now-a-days I've stopped that (almost) as I'm beginning to lose interest due to lack of any participation. But bloggers have been giving active participation right thru and it ain't any surprise that I'm still maintaining the same energy that I had when the blog consisted of only 4 members. Very often we find people who have not posted for quite a while starting with a quick apology for being a bit passive. That speaks more of the interest they have in blogging... Obviously, groups and blog are different entities... PS: strictly personal opinion. No generalization...

 Ganesh, I think Ram was trying to say to you that you need not post messages that you have sent to msitmmb. But I disagree that we have stopped mailing to the group after the blog. Some things that are related to the msitmmb group should be posted there. Things that are informative to the blog must be posted here. It should be the reverse. Dei, Ganja, you are into marketing, that too at CP, you should know segmentation and niche markets. Great to hear from Valli again. Valli, I invited Kathu to the blog, she has not respoded yet. Sangeeis also not responding. Manny, no news from you, send the address of Ajayan and Bala for inclusion.

 ur view may be correct.... but it makes data redundant.... What I mean means "both @ blog, & grp" is not necessary.... nothing more, Cheers Ram....

 hi, Joined CP on monday.i was taken thru a presentation by the training manager Mr.Vaidyanathan about CP. Now iam in kanchipuram for 1 week of training. I am here with a Senior STS Mr. Venkatraman. Went to the field today to met a stockist and other stores which sell CP products. nothin more. to bala,ajayan,vijay ,mahendran & rajesh. sorry that i could not inform u all of my departure. i will call u tonight.if iam not able to catch u all, u can call me in 954112-223342 or 223356. room no is 104.call after 10 pm. will process rini's marriage pictures as soon as i go back to chennai. iam sending the same message in msitmmb also bcoz i feel after we started using blogger we have stopped mailing to msitmmb.expecting ur views also on this. bye

 Valli... here's more info.. Madhu is yet to get her offer letter - hard copy or email... and if u wonder how she came to know of her selection despite not receiving any mail or letter from infy... here's the answer.. I told her...!!!!! I enquired about her selection when she had requested me to do so and informed her of her selection.. she's expected to receive the offer letter by month-end... and u r asking if I knew this...!! Infy pathi yaaru muuchu vittalum en mela kaathu adikkum... PS: by kaathu I mean "wind"... ;-))

 hi all, sorry guys....thoug i've not been actively participating for a week, i was a silent listener..... nice to hear that Kicha's heart had no space to pump blood, & his nose cud'nt inhale & exhale for a few minutes. But the saddest part is, he's still alive!!! Hey Sindhu, unnudan, andha Salem rowdy college, pisaasu dept la padicha adhae Madhu dhaan di....Kicha do u know that this Madhu has joined Infy?... We are planning our visit to India....though not sure, it might probably, be Jan 2004. I'll be coming 2 months before Ganesh.....In that case i'll not register for any courses in Spring.....These plans are highly susceptible to changes..... This weekend is Vinitha's reception....guess she'll be having a great time.......her parents are here for the occasion..... Nothing interesting happened last weekend, other than the phone call with my parents......happened to get "samy" movie, after a long time....everytime we go to the Indian store, he used to say, that it's checked out....never cooked...saturday, it was an Indian restaurant...sunday, it was a mexican restaurant.... Tried cooking Turkey(vaan koli) yesterday.....Ganesh only knows abt the taste.....I guess it did turn out quiet good.....that's what Ganesh said.... Are the photos taken at Rini's mrg, processed????.....there are many of us awaiting to see 'em..... bye...

 Read this informative article from evolt.org. It is about the urlLink Browser Wars . Thinking about it, I feel that there are some truths in the article for web users like us.

 Hey visit this site, A few things I've been trying to tell everyone @msitmmb.[ urlLink Message Digital Design Ltd - The Problem with 'CC' ] Why are there no posts on msitmmb? I keep checking and refreshing daily. I find only one or maybe two posts in a week. Can someone tell me?

 Kicha, It was really a long post. Maybe the title should have been "All in a week's work!". BTW, where are the others, the entire group is missing. What happenned. Thanks Ram for your comment. keep visitng that blog. I'll try to update it daily if possible.

 Hi, Out into the deep for a whole long week. Friday of the week-before, boarded the traditional Tuticorin express to madurai along with Rajesh, Swetha and her sister Sonia (sans "Antonio Mano")... Saturday 5-7: Got a TV at my house. Samsung Plano Bio with 300 watts output... Sunday 6-7: At rini's marriage. Met a lot of our friends. Covered by a few nostalgic tears, we went to Gowri Ganga that night for dinner before I sent off the chennai people in Pandian Exp. Monday 7-7: Slept almost the whole day. The only time of the dayt I didn't sleep was when I was taking bath and doing some other indispensable chores. Tuesday 8-7: Boarded Pandian Exp. Last time I boarded the train was when I went to take up the infy test... more nostalgia... Wednesday 9-7: Landed in Chennai and off to VisBabu's house to wake him, bala and ajayan. Remined me of "Sangeeth" days when I wake them all up at 6AM... Thursday 10-7: Went to attend a marriage. Ate heartily. The only trouble was it was so hearty that there was no place for my heart to pump out blood... Friday 11-7: Dragged bala and ajayan to Infy's Chennai Development Center. The last time I walked in there was for my interview... this time it felt awfully ecstatic to walk in righteosly... more reasons to be nastalgic. I met all my training batchmates. This time the trouble was that, the nostalgia was so much that my nose had even forgotten to leave out a few breaths of air. So, all the air accumulated inside my tummy. They got acted by some MealBananoCokicDewic acid and my tummy was proactive enough to flush out all the DiHydrogen Monoxide in differnt colors and odours. This celestial phenomenon needed a tablet shaped tablet and some holy water to take a detour. (whatever u understood don't ask me to explain this in simple words...) ;-))) Saturday 12-7: Went to The Beach. Cudn't find any Leonardo DiCaprios, But were able to see some Titanics and many Kate Winsletts (esp. one yellow tintedly dressed one) Sunday 13-7: Met Ganja and Rajesh and went to "Kaadhal Konden" film. An avial of Darr and Aalavandhan, but better much much than the latter... and boarded the Banagalore mail along with other mails and reached here this early morning... and just finished typing my post to the blog... and now on to the post... Hi, Out into the deep for a (...etc.....etc.......etc......etc....).......

 Hey everyone, visit urlLink Quod scripsi, scripsi . Fill in your comments on the blog itself. Don't post it in this blog please.

 Yep..!! Long post coming soon...

 I am working on the new layout for the blog. So far I managed to complete only the navigation panel "home | about |..." It's moving on slowly. Kicha is back at Bang. Awaiting a long post from his side. BTW where are the others? Nothing from Valli & Sindhu... Busya?

 hey, While looking out for a blog tool, I came across urlLink TypePad . I signed up for a beta test. They accepted me and now I've got my own blog. Check it out at urlLink Typepad . Seems to be my posts are working again. Still working on the blog layout.

 Yes, Ram, I noticed it today. It was present in mozilla. I noticed it for the first time in IE6 today. I have to work on it. So everyone please bear with me till things get alright. bye

 hi all

 Hi Jax, The new layout and updates on bio etc.. are good and fine.... But I face an issue.. i.e, whatever u have typed from the new layout is not visible for me as such.... at times it is visible... But mostly I have to select the text for seeing the content.... Whether its the problem with My I.E or anything else.... or anyone else face the same issue.... By way where do u have options to design the layout of the blog page in the blogger.... Cheers Ram

 Hey everyone, you can now give a title for all of your posts like this post. The title could be descriptive as this post. I feel the Members bio has become too large.

 Yeah, got a little busy visiting a few clients. No post from me because I was thinking of creating a new layout for the blog. So I got caught up with some experimentations. I saw a wonderful urlLink site a few days back. I'm using it as an inspiration. Let see how it comes out. Your suggestions for the layout are welcome. If you come across a nice website (in terms of design and layout), blog it. No sites using Flash. please. Manny, send me the mail ids of Ajayan and Bala (the ids they use most frequently). Update : Members bio.

 Good Morning, fine and hope the same with u all..... Where r u man JAX, no blogs from u for the past 2 days... Eager to receive blogs from ajayan & bala.....

 Hi all, Nice to read all the stories....specifically, Xavier's & kavi's...it took me straight to the wedding hall.....thank you buddies...... we happened to purchase a few indoor games last week.

So all the games which has been existing for ages in our country, has been existing in other coutries too, in some form or the other!! Last weekend was a longer one. July 4th , American Independence.....It was a long time we partied. So we hosted a dinner on friday. We get fire works in America only around july 4th.

 I would like to say just one thing to our juniors. It isâ€¦ â€œLearn From Your Mistakesâ€¦â€� Having made a great mistake by joining M.S. (IT&M) and after spending more than a year in this course, itâ€™s not the time to feel bad abt your mistakesâ€¦ha haâ€¦so think accordingly and try to find a good Koli who can offer a job for usâ€¦(just kiddingâ€¦but this is the fact tooâ€¦oooh!huh!) BTW...I wish u all a "Happpy Ganesh Chaturthi". May Lord Ganesh Bless u all.

 Hi All, How are you doing? We have one code delivery next week.So I am packed with work.Now-a-days I used to leave office only at 11 or 12 midnight. But it's interesting. Then valli..read your blog. My very belated wishes to your wedding day de!. Hey valli.Enna samaiyalla Expert ayitte pola irukku..I haven't seen all the snaps too. I have to. Congrats Rajesh! No calls from you.. It's been long since I heard from ganesh too.I planned to join yoga class here in infy from sep 15th It's for 14 days. (Kicha: I too will be back soon)

 Hi all, I have modified the blog to use an external stylesheet. The advantage is that now everyone can choose the type of layout they like. The blog will be displayed in the layout they want. Currently, I am trying to design a couple of layouts. I'll let you know when they are ready. Bye, Rajesh: I deleted the extra post of yours.

 I will tell "Learn as if you were going to live forever. Live as if you were going to die tomorrow. " gandhi

 Wonderful of you to bing out a topic for discussion. The question looks simple, but the answer isn't that simple. The more I get to think about your question, the more complex the situation becomes. As I had quipped yesterday, if I had the chance to speak to our juniors, I would have stressed upon: Know your core competencies - You have to concentrate on what you do best or like doing best. Some might be interested in moving up in the IT segment and some in management. Improve them - Once you have identified your competencies, try to orient yourself towards it. Learn more about the areas where you would be best suited to. Prepare a resume in line with your competencies - Most people try coping a resume format from others. Break away from that line of thinking. Sit down and think of the job you are applying for. Write down what aspects of that job you are suited to. Prepare a resume that tells the employer that you are the best person to do the jo the job More on this later.

 I hereby strongly condemn Mrs.Valliyammai for misleading the bloggers by using the words " beautiful young girl" for herself. I also condemn the attitude of imposing a non-real and impossible thing(valliammai can never become a beautiful girl ,which the whole world knows) into the general public who are using the blogger.I also warn her not to involve herself in any such activities in future,which on violation would be met legally. G.Rajesh Prabu B.E.,M.S(IT&M).,M.L

 Manny, thanx for the ids.....muluchikko, olunga velaya paaru...... Xavier, yeah, that's one way i shld have got the IDs....Anyway....i got 'em now... Had my first fall session yesterday.....know what....there are two other Indian ladies, with me in my Java class.....but they are all "Good looking middle aged women" & so i'm the only "Beautiful young gal"( in Rajesh's words)..... Vijay, i don't think i'll able to give any sugeestions to our juniors....i can just advise them, not to marry an NRI immidaitely after graduation, that too if she's very particular abt her career in IT. U cannot become a programmer here, unless u have experience or that country's education. Maybe i can give some inputs to our HOD.....ways to improve the standard of education given....& more particularly, how to get the best out of the students.....from a student's point of view..... I won't say our standard was bad.....it was actually very good....that too for our batch, with the best faculties & subjects.....but we could have done even more better...guess, u all will agree with me.... that's it vijay....nee varuva, aedhavadhu public news vaasipa, oodiduva.....tell us something abt ur work, interesting & crazy stuffs u've been doing lately....atleast how many times u played shuttle cock, yesterday...something like that........else, i wud have to rename ur nickname from Roja Babu to Bulletien Board Babu (BBB)...nalla irukku illa!!!..... need to prepare some yummy dishes for our brothers....i may not blog for one week from now...... bye.

 dear Vijay, actually what you said would have happened to me last Monday when I was at the dept. Kannan wanted me to give a speech to the juniors (current first years). But due to Chitra mam's intervention, I was unable to do so. I'll tell what I wanted to say to them tomorrow as I'm going home now. Bye,

 hi, hope everyone in our blogger family is doing well. sorry for didnt post msg for long time. i dont want to tell any reason for that. because, entrepreneurs dont find reasons for not doing things. - Jayaraman (i dont know the actual person who said it. i only know the person who told this one to us) i hav an interesting topic to discuss. we completed our course almost 1.5yrs ago. now everyone is having industrial experience(few has higher studies experience). assume that one fine day our HOD invite us to give a speech on career guidance to our juniors. what ll u say? what could be the core of ur speech? while preparing for it, u hav to keep one thing in mind, ie., the dilemma we had till the last day of our couse. whether to select IT or mgmt? people who forgot those days, pls go through the following incident. one year before, while everyone begin to search for their first job, one guy from IT profession asked one of our classmate that what is his/her specialization? for that our classmate responded as still I havnt decided between IT and Management. that guy now asked tell atleast in which area u did ur projects, because of our unique features, our classmate told that i did projects both in IT and Management. now that guy got angry(because he is a poor IT guy, he dont know anything more than that) and told, hey I am not at all asking abt Management, hav u did any IT projects or not, if so then in which platform u did it, what technology u interested? Microsoft or Java? Likewise he is going on adding questions related to S/W field, that we hardly knew. now this is the situation, we passed through those hard times and learned a lot in this 1.5 yrs of time. what ll u say now? i expect everyone to participate and post their speech. feelings:- ---------- class munnadi vanthu ninnu pesi yevvalavu nazh achchu. neenga pesinathu yellam innum kan(eye) munnadi nikkuthu. innoru santharpam kidaikkiradhu romba kastam, so atleast bloglaiyavathu post pannunga, atha en karpanaila neenga classla pesura mathiri ninaichchukkuven. (hmmmm sentiment work out ahhu thannu paarpom) expecting everyone's participation, vijay

 Dear bloggers and Valli, Everyone faces some problem with the net. regarding your suggestion of including the mail ids of all the blogers was implemented but only for a few minutes, I took it off again. That can be done when I find a way to put the bios of the bloggers. I have got a great idea now. But as it uses advanced CSS techniques, which IE does not support. If you use either urlLink Mozilla or urlLink Firebird , then the bios would be visible. Do not try it today, try tomorrow or the day after. Kicha, the use of marquee tag causes problems in the blog layout as expressed by Ranjini and Rajesh. So it would be nice if you could avoid using tags not supported by XHTML . This urlLink site would give you some idea of what I mean. BTW: If you are viewing this site in urlLink Firebird , you would notice a lot of nice things and also you would not have any layout problems. Valli, you can get the mail ids from urlLink Yahoo! Groups . Ranjini has put in her work in creating a database of our classmates. You can refer it anytime online. Hey, did I tell you, my application for MCJ has been accepted. I have also paid the fees. I'll be receiving my study materials soon. So you can expect a lot of jounalistic entries in the blog from me soon. Did I mention that Firebird and Mozilla allow tabbed browsing? A wonderful feature that you all must try out. urlLink Here are more reasons for trying out Firebird. Bye for now,

 Hi valli and all, My ID is: mahendrapallavan@yahoo.com... and ajayan's: ungalajayan@yahoo.com (if not, try out ungalajayan@yahoo.co.in also) And BTW How do u do dear bloggers... Entha nerathla sindhu anubavi rasa anubavinnu sonnalo therila...i became totally sick with my work...dubukku sindhu see now the time is 1.30 and i am still working...in my office... ok guys and gals...atleast i wish u all a good sleep... Mahen.

 Rajesh, adhu enna "Beautiful young gal", Good looking middle aged women", "elderly gentleman"???......verum girl, women nnu sonna pathaadha???....i thought the hook would be some where there...... we watched "Whistle" yesterday...it was more or less like "i know what u did last summer"....with a few changes here 'n there...... yes Xavier, i was trying to upload the photos in my album today....but i'm facing some probs....i cud'nt figure out what went wrong....i'm in a hurry today....i'll do it sometime next week......BTW, is there a way, we can add the e-mail id of our members somewhere in the layout??.....I was trying to give permission to all the bloggers....& oops!!! i was not sure of manny & Ajayan's IDs......& my souvineir's also misplaced somewhere...... can somebody help me out with their IDs????

 the layout of blogger is confusing there is a big gap in before the first msg in the blog ,Jax take care

 Rajesh, It was really an interesting puzzle. But as Ganesh had noted, in real life the driver would have been punished. I'm waiting to see the photos of Valli, Sindhu and Ranjini. Where are they? BTW, where is Vijay? Never heard from him for a long time.

 Machan , i thought that the driver must be punished & why the hell the conductor must be punished must be the answer. But it turned out to be the other reason. Well u see . hehehehehe (Arasiyala Ethellam Sagajamappa) bye

 Once there was a conductor, of a bus, who was very rude to his passengers. One day a beautiful young girl, of around 18 years, tried to board the bus, but the conductor didn't stop the bus.Unfortunately the beautiful young girl came under the bus and died on the spot. Angry passengers took the conductor to the police station, who in turn took him to the court.The judge was not at all impressed with the conductor and gave him capital punishment, i.e. to be electrocuted. He was taken to the electrocution chamber. There was a single chair in the center of the room and a single banana peel at one corner of the room. The conductor was strapped to the chair and high current was given to him. But to everyone's amazement, he survived. The judge decided to set him free, and he returned to his profession. After a few months, this time, a good looking middle aged woman tried to board the bus but the conductor didn't stop the bus. Unfortunately, this time also, the good looking middle aged woman came under the bus and died on the spot. Again angry passengers took the conductor to the police station, who in turn took him to the court. The judge took a look at the conductor and gave him capital punishment. The conductor was taken to the same electrocution chamber where there was a single chair in the center of the room and a single banana peel at one corner of the room. He was strapped to the chair and high current was given to him. This time also to everyone's amazement, he survived. The judge decided to set him free, and he returned to his profession. A couple of months later, an elderly gentleman tried to board the bus. This time the conductor, remembering his earlier experiences, stopped the bus.Unfortunately the elderly gentleman slipped and came under the bus. He also died on the spot. The conductor was taken to the police station and then to the court, to the same judge. Though he hadn't done anything wrong, but considering his past record the judge decided to set an example and gave him capital punishment. The conductor was again taken to the same electrocution chamber where there was a single chair in the center of the room and a single banana peel at one corner of the room. He was strapped to the chair and high current was given to him. This time he died instantly. The question is why didn't he die the first two time but died instantly the third time ??? The answer is given below .... but try to solve the mystery yourself. This is pretty interesting and the answer is perfectly logical. If necessary read the puzzle twice.

 During the first two times, the conductor was a Bad Conductor, therefore electricity didn't pass through him. But during the third time, he was a Good Conductor, electricity passed through him freely and he died !!!!!!!!

 Dear Ranjini, I am definitely not fidling with the layout as I don't have the time to do it today. I think it must be a problem at your end. If it exists on the morrow, blog it, I'll try to find a solution. Bye.

 Hi, Congrats Rajesh! & all the best. It seems as though, only a few days passed by, since Ganesh started holding my hands.....but, one year has has rolled by, in a wink.....Had great celebs last week....& returning back to the regular schedule today........ He gifted me a cool pair of diamond ear rings.....For my part, i threw out a grand dinner for him on the eve of our anniversery.....with all of his favourite dishes......here cakes are very cheezy & creamy. So i baked a pine apple cake myself with a whipped cream topping.....we called our parents, later that day & went to temple (nearby city)....when we came back, we had a surprise.......our friends, were waiting for us at our door step.....they had also bought a cake...made us cut it......it was, "my" dining room & "my" kitchen....& "they" were moving in & out busy arranging the snacks & stuffs....i was just watching them...I had the least idea of what was happening for quiet some time.... Saturday morning, as planned, we started out to a natural resort......It's called the red river gorge & the danial Boone forest.....we spent two wonderful days there, doing hiking & other stuffs.....we came back on sunday evening.....it's a deep forest....& we've to hike there....to see a natural bridge.....it's called so because, there's a bridge formed out of rocks connecting two mountains, naturally......we hiked for 1hr to reach that place....wow!! it was so wonderful....just a natural rock connecting two mountains.....no extra safety....we fall from there, we're gone!!!it was like walking on a wide board in the air......melae aagasam, Kelae Boomi, naduvulae naan......i had a real tuff time, controlling Ganesh, not to go to the ends..... will upload a few photos in my album today....& u can see them 'morrow.....Rini, indha photos aavadhu paaka try pannu di.......

 Congrats Rajesh! good and All the best! Oh kootam seekureengala kovaila? Serunga, serunga. Enjoy guys! What? A day without blog? Actually my senior had returned from Training today and so we had to finish off the work on friday and so couldnt blog any. btw, this weekend bought a brand new Whirlpool fridge, 220litre, grey(almost looks like white) color, double door refrigerator. Need to learn to do ice creams. So bloggers, send me recipe of icecreams asap. And ya Ram had called me up, but couldnt even invite him to my place for my policy of planning to invite only when learnt cooking properly. So i am still under learning phase and dont want to trouble u guys with all those mishap cooks. Hei guys @ TN, throw some light on Rain water harvesting. I heard that our CM has put a strict order in all corporation bound areas to have RWH setup. Is it so? I really am feeling happy. good that atleast now she has taken steps before it becomes too late. I like this. Remember few blogs away we were talking about environmental protection and we wanted people to encourage rainwater harvesting and now its becoming real is something good! Ok then got some work and will get back to u all later

 i have some good news waiting from my side.i will tell that in next week.until then its bye from raapi

 You're right Rajesh. Seems everyone's busy.



 Hi everyone, I am planning to implement a search and other minor features to the blog. Testing things out now... Bye,

 Hi, Ranjini....the marriage album is just 'tooo goood'. Both of you are looking charming and elegant. Jax, though its a closed chapter Iam suggesting it cos i typed this blog long back but didnt manage to publish it.....the layout looks alright. But I feel the fluroscent green is too bright. How about a lighter shade of green instead? Mahendra...ensoy panra pola??? anupavi rasa anupavi! Two weeks back we went to Warwick castle. The castle was built in 1900 and ranked number 2 in UK. There is so much hype abt this castle. The castle was beautiful. Since this was my first visit to a castle, I liked it. But Boomi didnt as he had been to many. The heat was so much getting into our system that we had to literally run for shadows. There were so many living rooms, dining rooms and bedrooms, each with lavishing decorations and expensive furnitures. The one thing that caught my interest was ' The Dungeon and Torture chamber '- I was really shocked by the cruelity with which the English had treated the slaves and the soldiers captured during the war. Later came to know that there is one museum in London exclusively meant for Torture. In India there are so many temples and buildings around which are dating back to some hundreds or thousands of years but very poorly marketed. Here they blow the trumphets in such a way that we run packing our bags to find the same thing that we have round the corner in most of the villages and towns in India. As you all must be aware this year Uk has topped all the records this summer. The temp reached a record high of 38.1 degrees. Now the weather is slowly getting better. Ironically, France declared that the country is facing a crisis due to heat wave on the day the temp. started dropping down.... Coming weekend is long one for us. guess where we are going.......Scotland.....just desperately looking forward to this trip. It is believed to be one of the most beautiful places in the world. Most Hollywood films are shooted here. Let me see if Scotland meets my expectations. Will upload the snaps shortly. Take care Valli. Happy Weekend. Bye.

 Answer to Jax question... "Uncopyrightable" and "Dermatoglyphics" are the longest isograms in English-language. Isograms are words with no repeated letters.

 Hmmmm jax, i exactly couldnt figure out the uniqueness of both the words. But then i could see that "Uncopyrightable" has got all the vowels in it and dermatoglyphics, sorry i couldnt guess any thing about it. do give us the answers as i am eager to know about it. and Ganesh thanx for the recipe greeting. It was good to look, but wonder how would it be to cook. Yes friends, Ganesh had sent us all the married women an amul greeting having recipe for "Chilled Salad soup" a novel way of wishing! I liked it! and my parents are here and i am learning cooking now from my mom. With in 10 days i need to learn maximum no. of items, let me see how good i can. Ok then will blog u all later till then cares and shares Ranjini

 hi I also met Om when i was in madurai. he did not tell me that he was going to quit. since i was in a hurry i could not speak to him for long. i feel sad becoz he was one of our faculty other than Mr kannan who gave us a drinks party on his birthday(hehehehe). dai jax have a look at the database in our groups. i had added long before that packya was working in Kodai. when i was in madurai i spoke to her also. she is doing fine.then met saravana kumar there and was talking to him for a long time. could not meet sandil & vinoth since they were busy. as for as now iam in vizag and will be here till this month end. bye

 hi ,i just wanted to say that im not one among that ten... hehehehehehhe raapi

 Hi all, we have over ten members and I find that a few of them have not even blogged once even though they have accepted the invitation to join us. This might be due several reasons, but atleast they could send us a 'hi' post. So if anyone is in touch with them, kindly ask them to post to the blog asap. Bye, P.S. What happened to my urlLink question ?

 Ok, here it begin, my one day visit to Madurai. Morning : As usual, I caught an auto to the dept. Enroute, I saw Vinodh Kumar. He was coming down from Sangeeth Lodge for tea. Thought about seeing him later, but couldn't. Came to know that I was the first person in our batch to be applying for a provisional certificate. Most of our batchmates had got thier degree certificates, so they don't require a provisional certificate. Our certificates have not been recieved by the dept. So I was asked to go to the univ. to apply and collect it. Met Omprakash - yesterday was his last day at the dept. He's off to Mumbai in search of a job. Rajadurai was on leave yesterday. Met Kannan and Chitra Ma'm. Kannan is taking almost all the classes at the dept. We were the last batch to have a lot of external faculties. After us, the external faculties have stopped coming at all except one or two. The trimester system has been scrapped in favour of a semester system. It seems that quality of education has dropped considerably. I spoke to Chitra ma'm. Rini, she said she did not get the invi to your marrriage. She had marked it in her diary, but as she didn't get an invi she forgot about it. Valli and Sindu, Ma'm asked if there was any good news from both of you. Afternoon : Made my way to the univ. went around the univ with my aunt to get things on track. I was told that I would be receiving my PC only on Wed, as Tues. is a holiday for Krishna Jayanthi. Skipped lunch. It was 4 pm when everything got over. My aunt said she'll look after things. Evening : Had a late lunch, watched TV and got ready to leave for Coimbatore. Left home around 7:00 pm to catch the bus. Coming to the bus stand, I thought of paying Shana and Philo a visit as they were staying nearby only. Went to their apartment around 7:30. Only Philo and her younger sis were at home. Spoke about things for some time. I came to know that Shana was working in ICICI bank nearby only. Waited till 8:30 to meet her. It seems she got her first salary yesterday only. Exchanged notes about our classmates and life in general for a long time. On their insistence, I had a couple of chappathis for dinner there. Left around 9:45 and caught a bus to Coimbatore at 10 pm. Reached Coimbatore around 3 am today. Valli, Philo wanted to know why you are continuing your studies and Sindu, everyone are suprised to know that you were in a marketing job. I heard that Bulb is working as a lecturer in Mother Teresa Univ. @ Kodaikanal.

 Hi, I was not feeling well last week......fever & head ache......the usual head ache, but it was more severe this time......My doctor said i was anaemic, & has prescribed iron tablets........Ganesh worries too much abt this, & stuffs me with fruits, veggie salads & lot more....he wants my haemoglobin to increase in a single day......he refuses to understand that it's a periodic process.....now i'm ok, other than the anaemic part...... So actually we missed the I-day celebs.......it was scheduled on saturday & hosted by the Indian students association of UK......we just called our friends here & wished them.....On friday, i watched & recorded the pattimandram alone, so that Ganesh can see it later......... I have got an "A" grade in my exams..... Yeah Mahen, i know you are very much interested in networking...but i did'nt know that you are preparing for the CCNA exam.....great!!! All the best...i'll surely help you with the best of my knowledge.....But i doubt my future interests in networking.....Networking is a great field.....But i won't be suitable for the field, i guess....i cannot crawl under the office floors to look out for outlet boxes & cables, nor can i climb up a ladder rack to reach out to the top most switch or hub for connections......I'm not that confident about my physique.....But i'm sure CCNA ceritified network engineers have great value......They can march amidst the entire lot with heads high!!! CCNA pannavae naan indha paadu paduraen......idhula, Ganesh wants me to complete CCNP & CCIE also in the future...... Rini, looking ahead for ur mom's arrival???.....kuduthu vaechava di!!!!

 Research paper rubbishes astrology Extensive scientific research over more than 40 years has finally confirmed what many always believed: that astrology is rubbish, and that it is based on the principle of deception. The research began in London 1958, and has just been published in the current edition of the respected Journal of Consciousness Studies. It is hailed as the most thorough scientific study ever made into the subject. Read urlLink full-story

 After a long gap, I met most of my friends and relatives.... how the entire 3 days went, I am not very sure... It gone in such a tremendous speed.... already I reached 2 hours late due to one way problem and heavy downpour in most parts of t'nadu till Mdu... and ought to leave home by 3.30 pm on sunday to catch bus, so as to reach office on time.... I visited all the prominent temples... Had a nice time with my family, friends and relatives.... My mom, wants me to eat, this that etc... etc... continuous suggesstions and what else??? My sister is doing fine in her +1..... guided her in +1 Maths.... to test her cycling meatle we ( in 2 separate cycles ) went for 8 kms cycling in the busy hours in high traffic area.... she does well... certified her to my mother for her daily schooling thru cycle..... found numerous changes in the native place... remembering memories back to b'lore....

 Well, nothing very special apart from spending 3 days in the warmth of my home. And after a gruelling, sleepless and tiresome bus journey that made me reach office much later than usual, am still feeling sleepy... Y..A..W..N..

 Oh is it! Convey my regards to all out there esp chitra mam! what hasnt anybody asked u to breif our juniors? Ok now, back to my tale section of this weekend.... I enjoyed the three days like anything. Superb it was to be with his friends. Not even one minute did i spend my time idle. Ore aattam paattam kondattam thaan. We played pattukku paatu, Dumb charades, etc. All the films which srini enacted, i was the one to find out first. We went to Ranganthittu bird sanctuary, but no birds to see except crows caw caw..... but the place was good with bamboo trees & rattt tatttt sound. Have u heard those sounds of bamboo ya? Then in the evening we went to Balamuri falls. we went in parisal u know. first time in that. Supera irundhathu. Naan pant shirt potta naala i could not bath in falls, else ore ragalai panni iruppen. then we went straight to Madikeri. Next day our adventure started with a trip to Iruppu falls. Wow the way was so slippery and watery. Should keep ur foot firm, illai keela vilunthu mandai odachikka vendiyathu thaan. The falls was so remote and beautiful. Only few were taking bath and i was the only female to take bath there. Ha evvalavu periya veeranganai. Infact srini never let his hands holding mine. illa thanni adikira adikku, avvalavuthaan, naan nera andha thanniyilaye bangalore poi iruppen. Poor srini! i never let him be with his friends, but then because of all the settais i was doing, he ought to be with me, coz i was climbing on slippery rocks, trodding on wet logs, moving towards force waters and what not....... Finally he managed to throw me out of water as it was becoming cold and i started shivering. Then we went to Nagerhole - Rajiv Gandhi national park. They said, Elephant ride and all is there, but nay coz of dusshera, all elephants had gone to Mysore itseems. Enna panna :- The next day we went to Abbi falls where also i had a nice kuliyal at one of the dangerous places. There also i was the only girl among four of us who had been there taking bath. Not even some of his guys were ready to take bath and i was shivering like anything as it was very cold and early in the morning 7 o clock. Good that srini always comes with me, though he wasnt interested. Really before going only he was telling, i m not interested in taking bath, but then coz of me he had to and we enjoyed like anything. Then we went to a place called Raja's seat where from we had a majestic valley view. So beautiful, with lush green fields, some in parrot green, some leaf green, some in brown color as the field was ready to get planted, some in golden yellow with water stagnant on it and mist then and there, wow superb it was u know. We then went to a place called nisargadhama where in we played shuttle cork and all his friends played volley ball till the last moment of sweat. On our way back from Nisarga we had ice creams drenching ourselves in rain. It was a beautiful place full of Bamboo trees and very cool on all sides surrounded by cauvery water, just like an island. So nice it was. Then we also went to a near by Tibetian monastery where in we saw some exotic and most beautiful sculpture and architectural work of Tibetian culture. Then we returned home merrily and totally exhaust! Photos eduthirukken, u all can have a look when scanned. Tomorrow my parents are coming and i am waiting for them to turn up. From tomorrow onwards i will get proper breakfast. Enga amma panni kuduppaangale. Ok then will blog later

 Iam blogging now from our Dept. lab. Will tell about it later.

 Google now has got a calculator feature. I wanted to blog it on Friday itself but forgot. Anyway you can try it out. Take a urlLink look at the features it has got. I'm leaving for Madurai tomorrow afternoon. So I won't be blogging for the next two days. BTW, someone try to figure out the uniqueness of these two words, uncopyrightable and dermatoglyphics . Answers on Tuesday, when I get back to work. See you all on Tuesday.

 Sorry, Manny, a change much earlier than expected. From now on, offsite links will open in a new window. Thank you for your clarification, I forgot the 'yes' part.

 Yes jax… an SME…it is an “Yes Yem yee” hope you get it…it is spelt as “Yes Yem Yee” (SME)…that’s y that "an" comes there…jax

 Hi Manny, Good to hear that you are now a an SME . Now I can ask you any questions related to networking. BTW are you working on Solaris platform, heard it was a wonderful piece of OS. Good to hear that you are also working on Windows installations. As a SME in that area, I can help you in any doubts in that arena. Feel free to ask. reg. the layout, consider the issue closed for now. I will rake up the matter when I make any changes to the layout. (which will be sometime around two weeks from now) I am hoping to hear from our NRI's about I-Day in their localities.

 Hi all, Back again… Happy Independence Day buddies… But this is the first Independence Day wherein my independence was lost… Yes…My job sucks my time… I have to work even tomorrow. That’s the sad news… And This is for Ranjini, Rini, Believe it or not (But u have to…ha ha)…I am now working as an SME (Subject matter Expert for all networking related projects) and am now working in preparing an e-book on Network File System Implementation In Solaris 9 OE. Also in another project in which I am preparing a course material for troubleshooting Dual Boot Installation For All the Windows Family of Operating Systems. Said enough abt my role, I hope. But I am not that much excited with this kind of theoretical work yaar…I am looking for some concrete hard core networking job and may be I will get one soon. Valli, BTW I am also preparing (of course I am preparing for the past 1 year or so) and still preparing for taking up the CCNA yaar. Let me see when I will be able to take up the exam…but for sure, I will get it soon. Glad to know that u also belong to my category, I mean the networking part of computers… Will get back to you once I get certified for knowing more abt the networking Industry in US. Hope I can expect ur inputs later…can I???!!! And nothing more yaar. And one final question… When will this layout issue be settled? I suspect jax, that he wants this issue to be unsolved just like the Ayodhya issue, to increase the interactions of the group…ha ha. Bye bye Mahen.

 Wishing all bloggers a very happy Independence Day. Question for the day? Are we still free?

 hi guys look into his one year presidency ........ urlLink Salaam Kalam

 The layout is now looking refined as u have polished those thick lines into fine thin lines. good ya Ok can do it later too and it looks ok now with the Archives link format and still the problem persists with the recent posts i believe. Check it out. Hei guys, yesterday i was in full shopping spree. Actually it was unplanned and all of a sudden, we decided to go for shopping to one of the malls where they had put curtains for sale. I bought some 4 curtains for two windows and on our way back, we crossed allen solly womens wear showroom. I was in pant-shirt formals. So when srini just asked, hei u had been planning to buy some pants for the past few days, how about trying now?, i said "yes". All these days i had been saying no, since i cant give a try when i am in other outfits, but then yesterday i thought let me. So went in and started selecting. Meanwhile, the lady there, said, there is an offer like, one garment free with every two we buy. So srini decided to get me two. Great! I took sky blue jean color, a bit elephant grey and dark blue mix color, a bit dark sandal color. Threee pants! I have given it for alteration and will be getting them back today evening. And ya tomorrow morning we and his friends will be going to a near by Hill station in coorg (in tamil its kudagu malai) called urlLink Madikeri and i am going to try all my new dresses on this trip. Oh yesterday i had a nice time removing hefty load from srini's pockets! Then we had dinner @ Shiv sagar. One tasty tasty vegetable dosa and a Gudbud ice cream. Bangaloreans, those who visit the Shiv sagar hotel in commercial can give a try at Vegetable dosa. It was very tasty and costed only 20Rs. ICe cream was ok, when compared to the all time tasty fig&Honey ice creamw hich srini had. Then came home merrily and so does my shopping story ends for the day! Ok then see u all later Ranjini

 I have made a change in the display, but what you want requires a little bit of JavaScript . I didn't want the blog to load slow due to usage of Javascript. I'll out something when I have some free time to jump into the depths of scripting. I'll be going to Madurai on Sunday afternoon and be back at Coimbatore by Monday night. My visit is related to my MCJ course. I can't make head or tail about our university's prospectus. On one page they say I need not send the tution fees, but on the form, they want me to send the tution fees with the application form. Got to straighten out things in person there.

 Jax, i think the month in the Archive section contains the entire name, but i would suggest it to be in first three character format so that when its listed in Archive section it would look good and uniform unlike now. and i think let the year be 2003 instead of '03. Coz there can be some problem in that single quote. If it doesnt occur, then no probs, just '03 is enough. For eg. 10 Aug '03 will do. What do u say? and now after few days the blog is looking good once we start aclimatising it. and that Bach CD is a collection titled Unforgetteble Classics. So there is any particular thing mentioned on CD cover regarding compilation. Two weeks holidays for u valli? Enjoy well. will catch u all later Ranjini

 Ram, it was a very long post indeed. but please don't post the entire html code into the blog. If you notice, I had removed all the formatting that you had specified. Sorry to do it. I had to do it because the blog started to display junk. Hope you don't mind me editing your post before someone starts complaining. It would be better if you could post using valid XHTML . Any queries regarding this can be directed to me.

 Thank You Valli.. Will get one gift for u... when v meet next... Already have purchased a gift for my sister so that I can handover during my native visit (Aug 15 - 17)... Numerous ideas to discuss, from the excerpts of the day 2 day news in 2day's world scenario.... torcher ur brain................. Dear All, Mail might be lengthy but worthy I believe. Don't circulate beyond the limit since it contains sensitive issues. Where, the world leads you ?? ONGC Mumbai - copter crash - Employees demanded the &quot;step down&quot; of it's CEO. Cause of accident, safety negligence or technical snag, enquiry on it's own way. India MPs ( including Laloo, has to surrender his passport on Aug 18 in Patna court after his return) visited Pakistan. Indian Govt not in a position to believe the Musaraff words due to previous experience. Confident level where are we. Balbir Singh looks like one MP whisked the security of Parliament and roamed inside like Hero. Security system under lapse. Pepsi &amp; Coke - May close to BAN due to over level of Pesticides. Will it be a election stunt like Bisleri water. Are you soft to these drinks. Frequent MiG 27 crash. Disheartened family members of expired Pilot given request to our first citizen, who is always down to earth, to take care of the AIR safety level. Hope you all guess. Yes it is Kalam. You know the statement released by them over a Press meet. &quot;We should avoid our people killed by our own machines than the enemies&quot;. 81 people hurt in pile up, series vehicle crash at Bangalore Hosur road. Incident occur after the two wheeler rider lost his control and hit a road divider. Foreign delegates felt comparatively, Bangalore is better than Delhi. Road safety is big task. British troops under threat in Basra, IRAQ. Supersonic Flight service dropped. A boy around 15 years old intruded into India border from Pakistan twice. Ofcourse he has sent back to his country by Delhi -Lahore&nbsp; &quot;Dosti&quot; bus service because of the peace initiative started by PM. Man from Kerala struggled for living with his family due to Pakistan citizenship which he got many years back under the wrong assumption that, with this he can enter India easily. Reinstating Govt employee in TN. Still some people future is under dark. Multimode train (MMTS) derailed at AndraPradesh after a day it was inaugurated. A baby (Noor) from Pakistan got operated at Bangalore hospital. Beyond border issue. David Kelly- weapons expert to Iraq suicide. Tony Blair - UK is cornered. Bush is out of focus. Liberian President steps down. Isrel denied to release the Palestinian militants after the recent suicide attack. E- tickets (for Air Travel) introduced in India too. First ticket issued to Mr. Ramadorai CEO of TCS. Can we &quot;check in&quot; without any hassle? Let him talk after his first experience. If I'll elect for next term, I will make AP like Singapore. AP-CM Naidu Where as Mayawathi - MP-CM , I'll construct RAM Temple. Feel the vision focus. Arnold nominated for California Mayor election. Thanks &amp; Regards Ramgopal C Garden City

 My head-banging continues here... I would have loved it if I were doing it for some kinda rock stuff... Tomorrow am going home.. and will be back on monday morning... tuesday is a holiday for us for Krishna Janmashtami... My blogging frequency has come down, but just for a month or so more... then I'll be back to my original. And one more thing. I want to know what is Enterprise Collaboration . If u get any links to knowing this send them to me...

 Rini, if u had not told anything abt ur boss's absense, we would have guessed it by this time.......the frequency of ur posts usually says how busy u are....Have a great time buddy......yeah i was also wearing (infact, made to wear) the nothy style saree on the evening of my wedding....but somehow, i don't feel as comfortable as our traditional style.....since there was'nt any full size photos, i mistook it to be madisar.....but u look great in this too..... Yep Mahen, Networking, CCNA paper I is over....I will most probably, be getting an "A" grade, i guess.....'coz i've been maintaining a consistent percentage in all my tests......yet to know the results......I told u, right?....theory part is not that bad....but the practical part, i found it very difficult......it needs lots of physical power....the worst part, is the termination of UTP cables.....God, it sucks!!!!....That's why, i made up my mind, not to take CCNA Paper II next semmester...... Lot of issues going on abt music.....namakkum sangeethathukkum romba dhooram........ guess i'll give regular attendance for the next two weeks.......till i go back to school........ Happy Rakshabandan Ram........need to call my anna too.......else i'll have to miss some nice gift...... ok see u guys, bye.

 hi all, blogging after a very long time.i read each one of ur blog almost daily. so i did not miss anything. got to write reg thamizh, education in india, auto problem etc. i will write them all one by one. then rini saw ur pps show. it was nice. iam in madurai now for 1 week of CP training. went to dept today & saw om sir,kannan sir & chitra mam.i felt very lonely yesterday here but now iam ok. tomorrow i will blog some of the issues as said earlier. bye

 ya i do remember now, But tell us what we should do to rectify the error now? And still i dont find the recent posts links working. y? I dont exactly know which composition of Bach its, coz we had bought on sunday and he played it yesterday only. I just listened and was impressed. will tell u tomorrow.

 Rini, the reason why IE throws up an error is: The "Recent Posts" index uses JavaScript to get the titles of the posts. if you can recall our JavaScript classes (which I don't), the single quote mark is a delimiter character. When a single quote is being used in a post like "Rini's blog", the script generates an error, which is what you can see in your browser. Moral of the Story: Never, ever use a single quote in the title of your post. As for Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750), I like his motets very much. Bach also wrote some of most beautiful pieces of music for a wide range of instruments. Most of his work were religious in nature, but his compositions were all easy to learn. Bach came from a musical family. Rini, what compositions of Bach have you bought?

 No jax its not working. Check out once again. Mahen, nowadays, i am focussed very much on Classical music, so i do find time listen to light music or indi pop only when i keep fm. Preference towards music differs based on the individual. Ya will surely give a try to listen to it too when time permits! Which project r u now into mahendran? Ya talking about the music, i want to come out with a small question which i read in a book yesterday! What is the difference between Indian Music and Western music? What is the cause of the difference whether its origin or expression? All can come out with your differences on it!

 The &sect; symbol is the location of that particular post. It is also called as a permalink . I have also slightly toned downed the colors of the blog, particularly the orange and brightened the whites. The links in "Recent Posts" should work now.

 Jax do there exist a link in the recent post to take us to the post? If so is it working? i dont think its. Or u are planning to have? And what is that small $ like symbol near that top arrow? And the error still persists. Not only for blogs but for other windows too. so it must be some problem with my IE. So u need not worry.

 u r right rini, it shud have been mis-spelt in the database. My firm's name is Vannet Techloggix. And this is the first day wherein i stayed in the office yaar... as i got to do my work and finish it within deadlines i ought to sit around this week to complete my task. thats it... and hey... did u hear Adnan Sami's new album..."Tera Chehra"... its nice yaar...if possible, but one and hear the songs... bye Mahen.

 Friends, We bought some more casettes and CDs as we have music system now. A brand new Sony music system. I got MS Subbu lakshmi Annamacharya Kirtans. Kshetra Tirupathi by TM krishna, and srini got Scorpions, one of his favourite band in those days, then one western classical CD by Bach. Its a thing u know. Excellent its to listen. I listened to it for the first time and it gives u the feeling of ascending a beautiful hill as the volume and intensity of music surges and it leaves u atop. Bach is a German musician and he is one of the Maestros like Beethoven in music. U all should listen to it ya. Just beautiful. I dont know much about this musician, may be jax might help us to drill about him a bit and throw light on it. As usual annamachrya kirtans are too irresistible , that too in MS voice it is damn good. Especially Sriman Narayana song. So calm really making u have a feel of total surrender at god's foot u know when she spells, "Sri paadame saranam". The flop of that day's pick was TM krishna's Kshetra Tirupathi. Actually there is a series of casettes released by CDW casettes. Its like compilation of songs on one particular sacred place or Kshetram. Till now five have come out, which include our Madurai(Singer-Nithyasree Mahadevan), Chidambaram(Sanjay Subramaniyan), Srirangam (Aruna Sairam), Tirupathi (T.M.Krishna), Kancheepuram(dont know). The best of it was Kshetra Srirangam by Aruna Sairam. Naan nenaikiran, she is a vaishnavite or one who worships perumal. ya she could pronounce the devotion towards the lord so profoundly in music that u simply cant remain in ur existing state. I havent heard to any of her other songs, but this. They say, only selective listening is recommended incase of Aruna, and this happens to be one of the best pick. We got almost all the Kshetra series except Kancheepuram. Ya Kshetra Tirupathi is by TM krishna, not the CM of Karnataka, but an upcomining vocalist. But we were impressed neither by songs, nor by his voice. May be since we dint listen to it many times, we arent much into it. Need to listen it few more times, to acquaint ourselves with it. Mahen&Valli thanx for ur comments on our album. Expecting feedback from other dormant bloggers too! What kavi, no goodmornings also nowadays. Where is vijay babu who said who will post atleast Good morning or good evening? Mahen whats that technologgix in ur co. name? is it misspelt in our database or its so with some significance? And y do u work late night and whats it that u are working on like this? Jax thanx for u correction on word Procs! I just messed it up. sorry....... Bye for now

 Rini, I viewed the blog in IE5.5, Mozilla 1.3 and Firebird 0.6.1. I don't get any errors as you've noted. Maybe someone else has got a error, inform me.

 yes rini...mostly i will be online...and yesterday i was staying in my office for the whole night and still working...so i was posting then and then... thats all... apram valli...Data Communication and Networks epdi poikittu irukku?

 Hei jax, i am getting an error, which goes like this Error in line 456 expected";" Do u wish to debug? but still i can view the blog, if i clik no to debug. And yesterday i got an error message regarding archives, the error message which i failed to notice properly. do have a check. Soem thing like that of insufficient memeory in archives section of last week. Do others get the same error or its the problem with my IE alone? guys online please check out and tell me. And ya mahen seems to be online always now. Guys u know what today is the flowering day of my plants i beleive. Ya Hibiscus have given two flowers and Sangu poo has given 4 blossoms. And yellow rose has given three buds, which will be blossoming soon. Today is the day where in i got maximum no, of flowers in my pot plants. wow i am so happy. Sangu poo supera valaruthu. And ya i bought 4 more plants last weekend. Actually i bought two plants and since i dint have change for 100rs, (two plants costed 50rs), i bought two more. This time, two croatans and two flowering plants whose name, i am yet to find out as they look different. One read flowering plant and the other gives a butterfly type pale pink with yellow center flowers. Really beautiful to look at. Its leaves are also so good, curly curly and in brownish green color. Its also giving lots of flowers these days. Ok then Will catch u all later Ranjini

 Rini, I'm never far away from the blog. I make it a point to check it every hour. Regarding my postings, I was trying to see how this interactions could be improved. Still no posts from many of us, but can't expect them to post as often as a few of us do. I was also try to get some of my work completed by this weekend. Clearing backlogs, you can say. BTW, the name is made much bigger, as for the line, it is not a dashed line, but a dotted line. If you are using IE, you'll see only a dashed line, not a dotted line. Blame Microsoft for it. Get a Gecko based browser like urlLink Firebird , it's quick and has a lot of additional features. As your boss is not in town, can we see a lot of interesting posts from you? Bye.

 What Mahen, will be online always? Flash comes ur reply!!?? How come. btw guys, y dont u put ur current address which might be ur office address or current residential address updates on to our database. I could see some empty columns. I am planning to add one more column to the existing database with the column name, Office address. so do update that also to make the database look complete. Hei guys, one good news, my immediate boss is out of town, for two weeks and i will be free till Aug 22. Not exactly free, but wont have much pressure though he has given me my schedule. You know guys, i am supposed to be in Hyderabad for a training in my working domain - Railway signal Engineering @ IRSET. But then since i had to go for a trip with Srini and his friends on 15,16,17, i have decided to forego. Even my division head is not ready to send me as i am the only female candidate. So he has promised to send me next year when i would have got more acquaintances and knowledge update too. And jax, y no blogs from u for the past two days? What happened? Layout pottu pottu onju poittiya, illa color combination paathu paathu theynju poitiya? And regarding the solution to autorickshaw problem, i havent yet given a second thought, so will update on it later till then bye

 Hi, it is good to see a lot of posts after nothing for a few days. I am yet to see the photos. I won't be able to view them today, maybe tomorrow. Rini, a small correction in your post about Wordstar and Word. They are not text editors, they are word processors. Notepad is a text editor. Jify . About Layout, later...

 Yes ranjini...i saw that... really nice... u look gorgeous...maami Mahen.

 Hei ram, after wedding snaps ellam set panni eduthathu thaan. Those taken during our wedding are only taken by his friend. He can take wedding snaps, but cant be after us once the wedding is over na. Those which u feel like we have given pose are taken specially by a still photographer and we got it printed soon and brought it with us to Bangalore for our friends to have a look. but big album in which the entire event is covered is still @ Madurai. Valli........ Madisar illa, just NorthIndian style. I like to drape my favourite outfit in this style. Coz it gives a rich look to the Silk sarees. Very often i tie sarees like this and it would make u look good, infact grand with very few jewels on you. So its a secret to reduce the weight of all those jewels but still look trendy and grand. U too can give a try. Its just the same as tieing ordinary saree but for paloo in the front. Mahen did u see the snaps now? Ranjini

 valli...u r wrong valli...there are three ha ha in my post...... ha ha h ahhahah...

 Hi all, Xavier, layout seems good now.......Is this orange ur favourite color?....adha mattum maathavae maataengura??.......If possible try some other shades of orange.....Green is good now.......Do we need the dotted horizontal line after every title?......As Rini, said, it would be nice, if the font size is increased......Other than these minor differences, i find the layout appealing.......good job done man!!!! Good job done by Mahen also.......such a big post from him, for the first time, with only one "Ha ha"......his trademark sirippu......Nice to hear a plastic bag free beach...... Hey Rini, Great photos di........Especially, the couples photo after the marriage looks elegant.....Are u wearing a Madisaar style saree or the ordinary one?.........awaiting to see more of yours........Pallavarukku nalladhoru uvamai koduthu puriya vaithu vittai......sabaash Thozhi.......(just kidding Mahendran!!) About the case study, trying to put myself in the autorickshaw man's shoes, it's quiet nominal to charge Rs.300 or Rs.400, 'coz of the constraints, lesser accomadation, petrol fuel etc......now, getting into the parents shoes, i'll surely try to go in for the cheaper commutation......The part where the autorickshaw association goes wrong, from my view, is "They have no rights to demand.....not the least one to order or force the parents to use autos".......so according to my observation, the change has to take place from the autoriskshaw man's side.......Their association, instead of demanding, has to do some attractive changes, that'll pull back the customers. Or if they try to do this, The customers will have no other way, rather than to get the corps. So my solution is (provided this same situation exists), to go for the SECOND CHOICE..... Saturday, we were invited by an aunty for Varalakshmi pooja.....happened to meet a lot of tamil families....got new contacts...... poittu vaaaraen...... valli.

 Because, some of the photo seems to be like posed... for eg. Rini after marriage... Srini after marriage... I think u ofcourse know that he took photo after taking it.... or he didnt used flash also... k will blog later... rAm

 Sari sari oor suthinathu podhum. And thanx for ur words of appreciation too..... and jax regarding this layout, please increase the font size of the writer and also let it be a bit below the line without dashing the line. And kadaisila keela irukara that notice kooda romba brighta irukku. Can dim a bit. I have uploaded my wedding album in files section in the form of PPS, prepared by srini. FYI all the snaps in the presentation have been taken by one of srini's close friend who is learning photography and its been taken without our knowledge. So u can expect some surprising expressions on our album! As the official photographs are @ madurai, we have prepared this album, using only those snaps taken by his friend. So only his friends and not our friends are there in the album! Dont get disappointed. Will turn out with some more snaps with our friends on it soon. So wait for the next release..... Ok then will mail u all later Bye for now Ranjini

 ranjini... chumma oru kindal thaan... but its really great to know that srini is blessed with a wife who can cook atleast sambar saatham and present it with the name of Bisibelabath...h aha nowadays it is a matter of pride to say that one's wife cooks in home... in that way i shud really appreciate u good luck and i wish u to be busy with ur bisibelabath... bye bye

 Hi all… Hope everybody had a nice weekend. And for us, it was really one of the most exciting fun packed Sundays in the past few months. Yesterday we (Myself, bala, ajayan and one more friend by name senthil who is vijay’s friend) went to Mahabalipuram. It was a nice trip where we enjoyed each and every mile of our travel. Unfortunately ganesh was not able to join us as he had some work related to his departure to madurai for his training. We started at 8 in the morning from T nagar in two bikes. We filled the fuel for our travel…and then we went to ganesh’s house to get his camera from him. We continued our travel in East Coast Road from ganesh’ s house at 9. The ECR is one of the best roads to have a smooth ride enjoying the pleasant sceneries of the seashore and the backwaters…this trip reminded me of the tour we went to kodai in bikes during our MS… And on the way we finished our breakfast in a motel… We reached mahabs at 10.30 I suppose… We went to Mahishasuramardhini temple there…we visited the light house and we saw the five rathas of the pancha pandavas…it was my first trip to mahabs and I really enjoyed seeing those sculptures there… Then we planned to go to the Kovalam Beach. But on the way we entered a forest like area, where we found nobody was there…so, we drove our bikes towards the beach …it was a nice ride on the sands of the beach which we enjoyed a lot…we reached the shore of the sea…and it was a virgin shore…(!!!) I mean nobody was there and you cannot find even a footprint of men in the seashore…it was so beautiful to see such a shore…may be this was the first time we are visiting such a place… And here comes the main part of the trip…ha ha… Yes we had our drinks party in the sands of beach under the sun…It was our first experience to have such a drinks party in a totally litter free, pollution less, open space seashore, filled with the pleasant sounds made by the waves of the sea... We had a bath in the beach with our drinks in one hand and a cigarette on the other… We were lying on the beach sand for more than 2 hours or so…after enjoying the drink and the sea breeze we started back to our destination having some tea and snacks on the way… During our return, bala terrified me a lot with his terrific speed…in fact, I got his helmet from him and wore it on my head…I was really frightened by his way of driving because his driving reminded me of the accident we met when we went to kodai tour in bikes… Ajayan too adding to his enthusiasm was driving at a good speed…but his vehicle was not able to pick up to meet his speed so he slowed down a bit, but bala doesn’t seem to slow down anyway…once he sees a pair of couple going at a far distance he starts chasing them…ha ha…aana pakkathula pona than therinjuthu ellam dubukku couples…ha ha… Thus we reached ganesh’s house at adyar to return back his camera by around 6 in the evening. Thanks to ganesh for loading his camera with a film roll for us… And thus our trip went on this way and we were back to our room by 6.30. This is just a beginning and our plans are there to go to pondy and tirupathi in the near future after I also get a bike. Hope to see rajesh, ganesh and vijay to join our next trip. I will share the snaps we took during this trip soon so that you too can share our joyful moments. Of course this is just a small trip without any grand preparartion…but the fun we had was something which we had after a long time since we completed our degree…that’s it. C u guys and gals. Mahen.

 Enna Meraturiya.... Sambar sathathugu... Besibelabhath eduaugathu???.... Men & Women padichaye... yesterday from ToI.. Reg. Singleton APJAK.... Apuram... Kicha's kitchen lla... Smoke varudhuna... that means... his pan is frying not the content..... (ha ha ha ha aha ha) neerum da... unku ellam... BB illa irundhu cut, copy paste pannita... neee cook ayuruviya.... coming to case study.... I go with Rini's view, moreover... I think Share auto runs in Diesel and other autos run in Petrol.... that also to be considered for their high cost.. and patriotism towards the country in minimizing pollution.... More later... Cheers Ram

 Layout looks good Jax, more about color combinations in later blogs. But first let me talk to Mahen. Enna settaiya? Rendu perukkum, (Ram&Mahen)appuram naan bisibelebhath senju courier panniruven jaakrathai. What u say is true about it, but the way u prepare varies and taste is also not exactly same ok. Word starum oru text editor, Ms wordum oru text editor, adhukkaga, MS wordum, Word starum onna? they differ in the features right, though they serve the same functionality. Adhe maathiri thaan iduvum. Sari onakku enga puriya poguthu? Idhellam kalyanam aana puriyum. Onakkum thaan, coz now a days guys are fast 2 learning cooking. I could smell something smoking in Kicha's kitchen too. Now adays he sends me recipe's too. so guys be on his track and start learning. Naan vena some simple recipe's anuppi vakiren. friends i will be uploading my wedding snaps and vinitha's reception snaps soon onto our groups section by this evening. so watch out for that! Ok then, on to Rajesh case discussion.... Problem: Rajesh, U know in the world of FMCGs Customer is the king, similarly, here User is the king. He has the right to decide his own way of transport. Since the advent of share auto we could see that the same transport can be arranged at half the earlier price. There is no wonder if a person opts for cheap and best service. But its a subtle problem, coz, these autorickshawalas have to charge more as they can accomodate less people, where as share autos can charge less as they accomodate more people. So these auto walas will have to suffer, if they cut the cost to the extent of these share autos.... Solution: Need to think a bit, so will post it later Bye for now Ranjini

 rajesh y is that u did not bother abt the opinions of sangee, ajayan and kathu regarding this case? ask them also to consider this serious case and come out with their opinions regarding this crucial issue... I am on my way to present my opinions sooner or later... ok ha ha haha h aha ha ha h bye da

 dear friend In Annanagar ,where i'm staying in chennai an interesting event took place.im putting it in the blog.you say your views about it.We have autorickshaws here to take school childrens to thier school.They were charging 400Rs per student till now to take them to a distance of 2 K.M nearly (to and fro).But after Share autos were introduced now a share auto person collects a minimum of 5 Rs for a person to cover that distance.So on calculating it takes 10 Rs per day for to and fro,which comes to 10 * 5 days/week = 50 Rs/week.so in total it becomes 200Rs/month which is almost 50%.On a concession he had agreed to get 150 Rs /month.But this auto persons who were on business till now are forming informal associations and threatening the share auto person not to do the job.They had also decreased the fare to 300 Rs which is still in expensive.due to the autocratic behaviour the school childrens are finding difficulties to go to school on time. Now the matter is before our appartments association.Now we have to choose from the below decisions. 1.We have to go by the autoRickshaw persons statements and pay them 300Rs/month. 2.We have to give a criminal complaint against the auto rickshaw GANG in police ,where they will be arrested and remanded.here they will be treated as criminals.(the shareauto person is ready for service whenever we are ready to give him a legal protection) so i want xavier,Mahendran,ramgopal.ranjini,kishore,valli,ganesh,sindu,vijaybabu to study the case and reply in this blog there opinion. bye and take care raapi

 What happened? I expected a few blogs by you. Nothing for the past couple of days. Seems everyone is busy. No posts from Rajesh, Vijay, Kavi and Ganesh for quite some time. No posts from Kathu, Ajayan and Sangee. Here are a few nice links to visit this weekend. urlLink A good joke urlLink To all thanni parties urlLink Resume of George W. Bush What about the new layout, guys and gals?

 Nothing to post but same message of new layout.

 Hey ranjini bisibelabath is called as Sambar Satham in tamil Nadu… I enquired some of my friends…I mean friends who cook…abt this… Bisibelabath is nothing but our Sambar Satham with more onions and ghee added to it… This is what they said to me. Sambar satham senjuttu…atha ennamo puthusa etho senja maathiri blog’la solriya…ha ha Atha vera valli ezhuthi vachikkanumnu oru suggestion veraya…ha ha… Nadathunga unga samayalai…good luck…

 I guess you all must have got used to the white background for almost 4 months, so anything other than that would seem unsightly. Most of your suggestions has been to eliminate dark backgrounds. I feel that a contrasting background would be wonderful. Right now, I have got a black background with a near-white grey text. It really looks good. Valli, any help is welcome. That's what I've been telling all the time. The best way to check things out is to take a look at the page source. I have mentioned a lot of details to help you out. save the webpage to your computer. Play around with the styles. Any help in figuring things out, blog it. As for the menus, Kicha, I think the menus are on the top, just below the Title. Or are you talking of the sidebar. Please clarify. Rini, Tell me how to put the content in the center of a two column blog. I feel geometrically challenged. Can Ram help me out on this? BTW, can someone suggest me a good birthday gift for a nineteen year old guy? His birthday falls day after tomorrow (Aug 9). Got a busy few days ahead of me, can't say if I can blog or not? Luckily, I don't have a bang-bang project. I've got six like them. So it is bang-bang 6 .

 hi all, I have my final exams for the summer semmester this week. I have the last one tommorrow. Had a very tuff time in my practicals, trying to terminate a twisted pair cable, with a connector & then setting up a LAN......somehow, finally i succeeded.....phoooo, stupid networking, takes so much of physical energy. Next semmester i'm going to just opt programming langs like JAVA, perl & SQL. Guess I would continue my Cisco certification, next year. My summer break starts from this weekend, & extends for the next 20days. Me & my friend, we are planning to do something in our hols......yet to decide.... Last saturday, i recieved greeting cards, one from my brother & one from my parents, for our anniversery(they posted it far ahead, giving allowance for postal delays). The cards were really fantastic, with so much of touching touching words, that i started crying. Ganesh had a really tuff time convincing me that day & finally he took me out, to stop my tears. That day we ended up in getting a brand new big wooden dining table(for which i had been pestering Ganesh for the past 6 or 7 months. All these days we just had a very small one, made out of steel, which Ganesh had got before marraige). Poor Ganesh, he wanted me to smile. But that can be done, only when he cries!!!! Xavier, that background color does'nt suit. Try avoiding dark colors for backgrounds. The green colored text seems to be even worse in this background. I understand that, basically, u need four colors for the blog. Maybe i can come out with a few suggestions, if u want. Rini, nice that you enjoy cooking. It takes time to pick up speed. i used to spend three hrs to prepare lunch, & three hrs to prepare dinner earlier. I purchased four books for cooking recipies on the day we boarded. Uma Devarajan, & Malliga Bhadrinath are the miracle angels who guided me throughout & ofcourse, my mom thru the weekend calls. I wud suggest u to get some good recipie books. It would help u a lot in the beginning.One more important tip i can give u is, record all ur recipies. Bisibelabath, u said u got it from ur friend....have u written it down?.....u might have to refer it atleast for the first four or five times, u prepare it. Only after that u get familiar. Have some burns oinment like burnol or silverex handy always. U might need them often in the beginning. will blog once my exam is over, bye.

 jax, When I said "most of ur post" I meant most of "that particular post" and not other posts... in fact, I don't even remember u mentioning about Patsy(mcox) earlier... I too think the only drawback is the background... pretty dark... and we seem to be more used to having the menus in the left rather than right... that might be one more option... It was an awfully hectic day today. Some issues in my code made me bang my head against the table.... bang...bang... I went throughout the day... and it'll be more bang..bang... tomorrow. The better part in the day was, we moved to a new building. Actually not yet completely... I got mail asking to come immediately to my place (from my project place) and pack-up everything from our PMUs (Personal Mobile Unit alias drawers) into a big box that was given to everyone. Then they were taken by the facilities people and placed in the new building (No.33). There, the entire ground floor will be occupied by our team.. Cubicles have been "allocated"... we were asked to search for the cubicle that had our name written on the white-board (usually every one has a white-board next to him). We have to occupy that place only. We got new terminals too. Black... Flat screen monitors..!!!! Thin ones... The terminals are not ready yet. They told it'll be ready by tomorrow and we have to transfer all our files very soon as the old ones will be formatted. Later tomorrow, I'll try to make some time from this bang..bang.. project, to transfer all files from old one to the new one...

 Hei jax, Ennappa Background color idhu.... thoongi valiyudu. Adhukku yellow color was far better. Come one give a try with some other good combination. If u ask me, Other than White i dont find any good background color, but then i wont stop u from experimenting with colors. Happy coloring! and put the blog content in the center instead in the left. Like the white and grey layout. That really eases our reading. I am not satisfied with displaying blog content in one side, be it right or left. Right or left Center is the best! Others look ok to me. will get back to u later Ranjini

 Hi everyone, Keeping in mind everyone's suggestions, behold the first set of changes to the blog layout. Now that it is done. What's your suggestions?

 Kicha, I guess this was my second or third post about her since this blog began. You call that often. The reason I'm using names is that I am tired of saying 'my friend, who is ..." and "My friend said that...". I makes me feel like a hypocrite. No harm in using names though. Also the message is clear when you use names. Consider, "I am a member of a blog with several of my friends. We post what we can in the blog, one of the blogger got married recently. Yesterday that blogger friend of mine posted a very interesting post on her cooking experience. Another friend of mine recently posted her travels around the UK. Yet another friend of mine sadi how he had spent his weekend." Easy to understand who did what. BTW, She isn't my cousin, otherwise I would've mentioned it. Coming to the next set of choices... Anyway, I have a question regarding your question, ' Girl Friend/Friend who is a girl ', what's the difference between the above. Literally, they are the same. Emotionally they differ. Let us say she's both two and three . Maybe she's not neither. Rini, That was really a very interesting post about your cooking experiences. Sindu, Continuing your tour of UK still... Yellorum Orua suthuvanga, nee nadu suthura. As Rini said, where are the photos? And Rini where are your wedding photos? Tired to read a novel and watch a movie (League of the Extraordinary Gentleman) at tha same time yesterday. Completed half a novel and half the movie. Planning to complete the rest today. more later,

 jax, I'm reminded of Pat Sy mcox... So... Who is Patsy... Most of ur mail is about activities concerning her only... Cousin/Girl Friend/Friend who is a girl/ or what...

 Hei friends Happy friendship day! u know what i did all these days, here it comes! Friday I bunked my office to slide my hours from the monotonous work. In the afternoon I prepared Bisibelebhath. a new dish, which I listened from one of my colleague and tried out. It came out good only. Ellam naanthaan sollikiren, sollikka vendiyathu thaan. My cousin Suganya was my test subject and she gave pass mark...... I dint trouble srini this time. Next time, probably tomorrow, I will make him also to undergo the test. Full day I thought I would take rest, but then cleaning the house and arranging things ate up my entire day and so did the week end too go with work and work. Especially washing clothes and dish washing is the biggest time eater. Its becoz srini often gives me leave in cooking, I do get a bit of time to relax. As I am new to cooking, I do cook slowly and need to pace up. I would like to learn cooking North Indian Dishes as Srini loves it, (girls/ guys if u know any good north indian recipe kindly intimate to me especially paneer items, let me give a try) but then he insists on not spending much time in cooking. But cooking is my new venture, and as I see, that I am not such a worse cook, my interest in it doubles and I long to cook too. But srini toh, ties my hands, and I dont know, from whom to learn all those north Indian dishes. Anyway soon I will give a try at those too and surprise him. We bought a new Sony Music system yesterday. Its in Grey&Silver color chasis. we actually ordered for grinder too, but its yet to be delivered. So as such we have now started furnishing our home. Hope by this weekend all the most necessary amenities would have been taken care. Saturday srini invited his friends and i cooked tomato rice. It was also good and i am becoming an expert in preparing that u know. Sunday i cooked rice, sambar, meal maker fry, cabbage and carrot poriyal. Everything tasted good u know, especially mealmaker fry, srini loved it. Arey i cook so many new items and i have to drill this fellow to eat. but he never repents and abides. But still to learn so many. We dint go to any concert as planned before. I would have loved to go to Sanjay Subramanyan's concert on thursday, but as srini went to donate blood to one of his colleague's acquaintance, he couldnt take me and so i couldnt go. Yesterday evening we planned to go to Sudha Raghunathan's concert but then as it was raining so heavily, we couldnt. Anyway we had a nice time chatting with his friends, who are so humourous to the core. My god, what a bunch they are!!! Yesterday evening i went home late waiting for srini. But as he was busy, he couldnt pick me up and so i had to go by myself. How boring its to be alone at home. Thanx for the music system which we bought! Then i started cooking for three of us(Srini, myself and his friend). As i started cooking, i started receiving calls after calls and so i couldnt cook properly with full concentration. Illatti mattum romba olunga samikirennu nenappu. Finally with milk boiled over and onion and dal, fried a bit (all these happened as i was talking over phone) i presented a delicious dinner to the two. Poor them!! But the thing is, it was like, u can eat and the side dishes tasted really good inspite of some hiccups. What every body's mouth is watering to taste my samaiyal? Wait wait, avvalavu seekiram invite panna maaten. Still i need to learn some special varieties which i am planning to do once my mom comes for a vacation from 18th Aug! So after my coaching classes are over, Bangaloreans, keep ur tummies empty to fill up with my Sourashtra Cuisine! Sindu, nalla oor suthriya! Sari sari snaps aavathu anuppu enna. Nangalum nee kandukittatha kandukurome. Why so many people have gone for Hibernation? Wake up everybody. Otherwise i will come out with my tasty preparations to be tasted by u all soon! Hei other than Bangaloreans, u all have to wait till u get ur chance. With lots of hopes to cook for u all soon, its bye for now from Ranjini

 Why is it an '1.62' million dollar question? I expected something much higher.

 By now, its not a news anymore. It only throws up ripples of thoughts, of our days at our 'famed' campus. 2nd trimester... when we first had a glimpse of this "mystery man" who didn't marry a punjabi girl and who did MCA, all just because his mother had asked him to do so... and who stacked up a series of degrees next to his name... all just because he "felt like" studying them. It really amazed us when he allocated topics for our seminar in the field that we were interested in. Be it electrical, mechanical, electronics, political science or even biology , he was up there with no dearth of knowledge. We knew him in the campus as someone who would ask his students to study Software Engineering book in 3 days, or teach the 25+ chapters in ERP or e-com book in less than a month... but off the campus, we know the kiddish side of him too... someone who would sneak into Rajesh/Ganesh's room in TTS to play a game of RoadRash or pick up a CD and sit down watching movies... or get tangled up with some frivolous conversation with our guys there... that made a lot of sense to him... but was just another pastime for we people. And who could forget the adventure of "looking for a girl" to get him married... or the day when we took him out for dinner to make him postpone our internal... Now, he is not there amidst us. May be, his only unfulfilled wish was probably that he didn't get married... But looking back, I feel, its good that he didn't get married... if you understand what I mean... From our side.. these are the things that peep in once in a while, reminding us of the harsh realities of life... Life could be so simple and yet so complex... There's a long way to go.. after all, we are hardly getting started with our lives... and miles to go before we too sleep...

 I can't believe it even now......I always thought, Mr.Kannan, to be a very cool man....never imagined, he had hypertension or blood pressure......More than a good proffesor, he was a great man, with so much of patience......I've myself tested his patience a lot many times.....Remember, he was writing all his degrees once on the blackboard....I'm never going to meet such a mastermind, again, in my life.....May his heavenly spirit, rest in peace.....

 Hey, I talked to Sam and Vinothkumar, s Kannan Sir is no more, On sunday (28th Sep 2k3) morning after feeling pain in his chest, he got up and went to wash his face... there he couldn't manage the pain and fell down near the door, Michael found him and called TTS physician, they suggested to take him to Grace kennet... they routed to Appollo but they opened their hands, Thereafter he was cremated in Thatchanery near his sister's home by 12:00 pm on the same day... His soul should rest in peace....Hope he had high BP as well hypertension. Yeah coming to 2 hours at Rini's home.... really she is Best cook for Tomato rice, Rosemilk, Raitha and Green chutney... Rest, yet to test particularly Bisibelabhath... Rgds

 Hei what, what all of u r doing? Diwali is nearing and what u people are going to buy? I have bought two new chudi's this weekend. and will be getting a set of sarees too from my parents and my in laws. hope this diwali is going to be grand for me with many new dresses from all sides. And ya during pooja hols, we are planning for a small trip u know... Ya we are planning for a visit to chennai on Oct 2nd & 3rd and then a trip to Pondicherry on 4th & 5th. This weekend Ramgopal & Kishore had been to my house and we had a nice time. Hei wait i forgot to tell u, they gave me .. Best cook .. award after tasting my delicious Tomato rice and Rosemilk. Others wait please........ I know all of u r eager to have their turn, but then dont worry i wont miss anyone. Vijay u met sachina? hmmmm must have felt so happy. but then Shuttle thavira Crickettum theriyuma? And ya here is a small article on the Carnatic Music Trinity. Hope u all to enjoy reading it! *********************************************************************** It is rarely that a phenomenon takes place in the world. An epoch-making event of far-reaching consequence that would change the course of history. The advent of sages, saints, great men of science, sacred men of art, have all heralded new beginnings in their respective realms. In the world of Indian art music, the advent of Shyama Sastri, Thyagaraja and Muthuswami Dikshitar changed the course and perception of music. The harbingers of a new age in classical music, the threesome are reverentially referred to as the Trinity of Carnatic music. Not without reason, the foremost of which was their being born in the same town and being contemporaries. But this was not the only reason. Their pioneering work was such that after their times, Carnatic music was never the same again. Looking at their works, one finds a unity of purpose behind them. This unity of purpose is reflected in the fact that the Trinity refined the medium of the kriti and made it into a wholesome entity. They also brought into vogue several ragas that had fallen into oblivion. That they adopted almost the same methods and utilised the same tools speaks volumes about this unity of purpose. All the more reason why, they are hailed as incarnations whose specific task was to elevate the art form into a true rasAnubhavA. The art form as an experience that would ennoble the heart and lift the soul of man to greater heights. The purpose of an incarnation is to transcend and transform. Shyama Sastri, Thyagaraja, and Muthuswami Dikshitar transcended the mundane and transformed the way music was handled. The Trinity proved to the world through their music and through their exemplary lives, that the sole purpose of music was to make man perfect and help him realise his unity with God. *********************************************************************** (Jax: Since i got this interesting info thru mail and dont know from where its taken, i have pasted the entire article and so couldnt have link alone) A very good introduction on Muthuswami Dikshitar compostions is available in a semi classical-fusion album Panchabuthams featuring carnatic vocalist Bombay Jayashree, it contains compositions themed on the five elements. L. Vaidyanathan has composed the music with contemporary orchestration, while the rendition of the krithis is purely carnatic. I happened to listen to this Casette. Hei do u people know that its brought by "Dinamalar" paper? Ya really surprised and indeed felt happy to see that such good music albums are supported and Canvassed by one of the popular daily. Supera irukku indha casette. U people need not know carnatic to listen to such songs, but then any good listener could see the beauty in each rendition. Its about 5 elelments of Nature. There are five songs , one each for Agni - Fire, Akash -Space, Vayu- Air, Anila-Water, Prtihvi -Earth and each song, preceeded by a hymn from rig veda. Actually its sung in praise of the Lord siva, who is represented in the form of five elements at five different temples in TamilNadu. A descriptive back cover helps us to learn more about the renditions. So hope u people to plunge urself into some good and different music in days to come. Till then its bye !

 Hope everyone had a nice weekend. Kicha, you need forward messages sent to msitmmb to me. I have taken steps for the mails to reach me. Thanks for your help. Is it true that Kannan sir had passed away (via Sampath)? Update : Bala confirmed it (via Sriprasath). May he rest in peace.

 Congrats Valli, on ur new assignment.. and yeah, u are right... this guy/gal is among us only... a little bit of research into the mail, makes a few points clear on who it is... after all, there aren't many people who would go to this extent... rini, it seems, is not able to access the blog too, coz of some problem with their server... Have nice weekend...

 Hi, I've got a part time job as a programmer intern.....will be joining work from next week....& I'm going to help my department as well, in their web site maintanence & get credit hours for that......kinda fully loaded myself, for this semmester...... Kicha good job done....but i have some strong strange feeling that, the guy/gal is one among us....He seems to know all of us.....Since he had the access to our groups, he shld have easily laid his hands on all 45 IDs...then why did he pick just a few IDs & send them that junk again??....What so ever, we've witnessed, one of the ugliest disadvantage of electronic mails....Hope this does not happen in the future.....

 While the unprecedented global popularity of the Indian Diaspora is on a constant upswing, there is more news to cheer. Eight young NRIs join an impressive list of people responsible for innovating anything from wireless networking to artificial organs, by making it to the prestigious List of Worldâ€™s 100 Top Young Innovators, complied by Technology Review , the Massachusetts Institute of Technologyâ€™s (MIT), magazine of innovation. urlLink more..

 Dear Kicha, Thanks for your response. And this is for everyone. Do you think you know scientists from serial killers? Find urlLink out . BTW, I have managed to change my preferences so that I receive all the group mails at my postmark id till the yahoo groups problem gets sorted out.

 I've just sent the following mail to the groups... Hi All, As rini and jax are not able to access groups, I have communicated with jax, and have taken the following action on their behalf... Membership Type : Restricted (you approve all requests for membership) and raghu_boddu@hotmail.com is removed.. I'm Cc'ing this to the great boddu.. to let him know he'll not be able to receive the mails sent to msitmmb anymore... or send anything...!! Kicha

 Kicha, as you should have known by now, Yahoo groups has been blocked by most of the Indian ISPs as per a GO. I tried to access msitmmb from several browsing centers yesterday, but to no avail. I'll send you my yahoo password. you try changing the group settings from my Yahoo id. OK. Reply soon.

 Raghu Boddu strikes again..!! rini, jax... is his ID removed...?? I've sent the following mail to groups this morning... this is for those who can't access the groups... Hi, Boddu will be removed from msitmmb soon... but he seems to have found another way to work around.. He sends to the individual IDs... to stop receiving this stupid mail block his ID by clicking on the "Block" button... Latest in Raghu Boddu's hit list are these IDs... mvinitha@rediffmail.com, jxavierroy@yahoo.com, chatchander@yahoo.com, yourskganesh@yahoo.com, vallichidambaram@yahoo.com, tilaka666@yahoo.com, rini_1978@yahoo.com, funvijay@rediffmail.com, karthi_nov26@yahoo.com As u notice... He has put the subject as "Job Offer!" and sent the same nonsense... Please block this idiot... Kicha

 Hi all, Rini: I have mailed you a reply. My postmark id is xavierroyATpostmark.net. You can do as Kishore said. But before that I really would like to know Raghu is. Damn the DSL guys. I'll go to net cafe today evening and go through the groups. Life would be much easier if I had the source code.

 What the hell is happening in the groups... Whatever the poll tells, moderators please remove that stupid Raghu boddu from the group and make it restricted.. jax, I've forwarded the mail to ur postmark ID... rini, as jax may not be able to access the groups, u please take immediate action... We should not allow this to repeat...

 Hi all, I found out the reason why I was unable to access urlLink Yahoo! groups . Damn urlLink Dishnet DSL . Read urlLink why . I'll let you know about my tour later.

 Hi, Some problem with my system here.. it has been off the network since y'day morning.. am typing this from my teammate's system.. will be back once I get my system going...

 during last thursday and friday i thought that the sunday is going to be one of the worst sunday i had ever pass through. with the absence of ajayan(in kumbakonam) and senthil(in bangalore) i didnt know what to do. after analysed various possibilities, i decided to go to MAC statium to watch Irani cup. as i dont like going alone, i convinced one of my colleague(naren) and took him to "Rest of India" versus "Mumbai" match. i didnt believe my eyes, my favourite, all time star, cricket god (romba overa irukko) sachin is standing just few yards away from me. the scenario was like, ROI has to chase the target around 320, and they were 90/2 at that time and the greatwall of India(dravid) and the local boy(balaji) were at the crease. the other key players i hav seen were agarkar, kambli, laxman and salvi. around 12.15 they went for lunch. we too left for our lunch to naren's home. supppper sappadu. (chicken)biriyani, fish fry, white rice with fish kozhambu, rice with rasam, rice with moore,............. I really tired in this process, i was unable to get from the chair, so naren took me carefully to the wash basin... initially we planned to go back to the match. but naren's friends came to his house, they pulled him to the "Thiruda Thirudi" movie. so we started to that movie, we went to 3 theatres, but in all those 3 we didnt find the ticket(not even in black). so they started to beach, but i decided to go to my room as i hav to wash my clothes. so the remaining day went in washing the clothes. ram, dai venni yennada valliya orediya pugazhura. what u told??? "American school has taught u a lot". how can u say like that. in American school she has only very few things to learn but more things to teach. she ll teach there based on the knowledge and skill acquired from msitm(professors and classmates) da. valli, beef rice - in chennai, in the road side fast food hotels, they usually call the beef fried rice as beef rice. reg. new members - chance kidaicha pothumae, vanchi theerthuduviyae. but i havnt expected my name to be the first one in ur list. ranjini, un samaiyal mega serial enna achchu? jax, sorry for not answering for ur qns reg blog layout, bcos i m not at all interested in it. anything is ok for me. kicha, eppada formukku varuva. sindu,mahendran,ganesh,rajesh,kavi - ellam enga poiteenga, bcos of ur absence i m posting lot of msgs, it is not good for the health of our blog. so return soon. (actually the blog's heading should read "two hours with sachin")

 Hi, Hope everyone had a nice weekend. I'm going to visit a few locations at a client place today. So there won't be any posts from me today. Rajesh is on tour. Today, he'll be at Nagercoil. Hope he blogs about his tour. Science is organized knowledge. Wisdom is organized life. - Immanuel Kant Still unable to access the Yahoo Group!

 Rini, That was really an interesting link on the universe. It was almost a revelation of the universe and its beauty. BTW I got no reply on the set of styles from anyone except Valli. Plese view the style sheets at " urlLink Quod scripsi, scripsi " also. I am planning to bring them to this blog. Still not able to access Yahoo groups. Rini, as one of the moderators, can you tell me the result of the poll? Have a nice weekend,

 Hi, The Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida has put up a very interesting Java applet on their site. It begins as a view of the Milky Way Galaxy viewed from a distance of 10 million light years and then zooms into towards Earth in powers of ten of distance. 10 million, to one million, to 100,000 light years and so on and then when it finally reaches a large Oak tree leaf. But that is not all it zooms into the leaf until it reaches to the level of the quarks viewed at 100 attometers. Copy and paste the link below to your browser address bar to view this: http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/primer/java/scienceopticsu/powersof10/index. htm This is a fantastic representation of how magnificent the Universe is and how vastly infinite it is both in the macroscopic and the microscopic level.

 Hi, I might be busy today as I've got quite a lot of work scheduled for today and tomorrow. I guess everyone would have harboured a thought of being a scientist at least once in thier life, wearing white lab coats, working with microscopes and other scientific equipment. Take a look at urlLink some really interesting jobs in the world of science. Tell me which job you like. And still be doing, never done. - Samuel Butler , Hudibras (pt. I, canto I, l. 204) I have also added a couple of stylesheets in " urlLink Quod scripsi, scripsi ". Check out the styles and let me know which ones you like to have in " urlLink All in a day's work! ". I'll be updating " urlLink Quod scripsi, scripsi " soon. Rajesh and Bala are finally entrenched at Coimbatore. They are staying at a mansion here, just a few right and left turns and a couple of S-bends from my house. Rajesh has got a cell now. He'll be posting his number soon.

 On to another weekend... am yet to be released from this project... its just the warranty period for maintenance (for 1 month)... not much work to do, but still they are hesitant... my PL wants me to time-share and begin work here also, but that project's PL is telling I shouldn't do anything until I'm released... I told this to my PL, he says, if he tells that the next time, ask him to talk to me... am getting sandwiched between the two... Reminds me of how we had a similar situation tackling the two extremes of RT Swamy and Balaji during our placement activities... Though it didn't achieve anything atleast now I'm not finding myself in an unfamiliar situation...

 Don't get excited Man.... Our Yahoo groups namely "MSITMMB" has got to its earlier stand.... Thanks to Rini, 2 B'day reminders namely Kicha & Ajayan.... Cheers

 Hey I'm unable to get into Yahoo groups at all. Any messages there. Someone please forward the recent messages to my postmark id (xavierroy@postmark.net).

 Valli kallaikita... poo... Chance yeah.. illla Gr8.... American school has taught u a lot.... gud... By way, I doubt whether u will accept the same kidding messages if it comes from others instead of vizbabu, ganesh, rajesh or some of us.... Note: This blog is to prove that I ought to post a lot but couldnt.... Cheers

 Hi, The reason why I had asked you all about inclusion of new members was because everyone was included in a similar fashion, if you can remember. I was just asking for the sake of it. Nothing else. But as Valli and Kicha have noted, things said to a person should be treated as it would be if the person is in front of them. Things intended in the light sense should be taken lightly. Maybe we can have some rough guidelines to follow in the team, not rules but simple guidelines or a sort of docs and donates. They could be related to the interactions between the members. For example, we mostly do not discuss political issues in the blog. I hope you understand what I amtrying to convey. Such a guideline would be helpful to newbies. BTW, I cannot access the Yahoo groups for the past two days. Kicha, can you forward the recent mails to my postmark id? Don't send it to my office id da. Valli, that was a lot of synonyms that you used. I have put up the stylesheet at my yahoo id. So if Yahoo fails, then you must have to view the blog sans styles. I am still working on them. Maybe soon. Thanks for your suggestion on the fonts. Kavi, there is a "Switch Styles" heading on the right side. Click on any of the links to change the style of the blog. If it doesn't work, try clearing your system's cache. And if it still doesn't work, send me the browser details and the exact problem you are facing. Note : Please do not use the quotation marks in the title of the post. It creates Javascript errors. If you want to use quotation marks, please use the following tags to indicate a quotation. &amp;quot;example &amp;quot; . It would be displayed as &quot;example &quot;. It is good to have a discussion about the inclusion of people. Ideally I would be really happy if there were 45 members in the blog. If we had no faults, we should not take such pleasure in calling attention to other people’s. - Francois La Rochefoucauld

 I support valli's point... that "play with each other" point... it has been there in college days and continues in the blogger... and it has to be that way to maintain this cheer in the interaction... Today I got a mail from (name censored) who told me in his/her own way that I'm trying to act smart by that last mail that I sent to msitmmb and that nobody else kidded like that. Oh...Boy..!! Has our people lost a sense of humour... or rather, lost a sense of differentiation between humour and something else... I've mailed a one-liner reply to that person saying "But I thought you had sense of humour." If that person gets to read this post of mine and that of valli's (I wish he/she does), he/she will get to know, the very informal and cheerful culture prevailing among us... if that person doesn't like this, then we can't help it...

 Kicha, glad to know that u were also furious, watching those kinda programs.....& Vijay, that was a great news abt the IITs.. Xavier, the color scheme is a good idea.....it was nice too.....guess it would be better, if the post's font also changes to that color(with a slight variation in the shade....a darker shade).....I shld try one of those sofwares Xavier....thanx for the info......i'll surely disturb u, with all my inquistive(??!!) questions, when i try them........ & abt the new members....as u've mentioned earlier...any of our batchmates are invited......on one legitimate condition..... we are a group of "INFORMAL FRIENDS"......we, by all means, have all the rights, to tease, kid, josh, banter, fool around(ivvalavu dhaan enakku theriyum!!!) in a nutshell "play with each other"....... for instance, if i say that Vijay is a loose mental , Rajesh is an Aan asingam or even Ganesh is a maramandai , nobody is going to take that seriously.....anybody joining us has to accept this...hope u guys agree with me...... Hey Rini, saw ur photos .....u look gorgeous...... Vijay babu, nobody's going to critisize, abuse, upbraid, berate, revile, rail, grumble, dress down, reprimand me.....podhuma???(Xavier, plz don't try to find any fault in this....aedho oru enthu....dictionary.com la irundhu "cut, copy paste" pannitaen). BTW, do u have beef????.......what's that beef rice?..... yep Kavi, i know the whereabouts of Anitha, courtesy: a few of my UG friends......kishore, nee konjam late pa.....vacancy filled....nee olunga un kayathukku marundhu pottuko(ulkayam, velikayam ellam dhaan) bye

 Hi, Vijay really you had a great day with ajayan it seems. Kishore pothum.... She is good looking.. But she is already engaged..So try to look someone in Electronic city itself... Rini..How are you? how is life going? Jax here I am getting the same old layout..Why???? Hope I will be in office this saturday and sunday.Nothing very spl. Good Night!!

 Actually I have to post Praising mails to RamyaPriyadharshini, viz babu etc.... But What to do?????????? no time.... Extremely showing as very busy.... Ganesh, Note the TIME Plz.... Cheers Ram Note: - This blog is to prove that I am active....

 Two gentlemen from a bglr based mgt training institute, conducted a workshop for us at the end of our 5th semester. In that workshop they mentioned "Mind reads what it wants", and they explained that with few examples. The following one is somewhat similar to that. Aoccdrnig to a rscheearch at an Elingsh uinervtisy, it deosn't mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are, the olny iprmoetnt tihng is taht frist and lsat ltteer is at the rghit pclae. The rset can be a toatl mses and you can sitll raed it wouthit porbelm. Tihs is bcuseae we do not raed ervey lteter by it slef but the wrod as a wlohe. to Xavier, xavy there is no point in asking whether to add someone from our msitmmb group to blogger or not. bcos u clearly mentioned in ur mails to msitmmb as, "If you want to become a member, the only requisite is 'active' participation." "The blogger group is not a form of elite group where only a few are welcome. If the bloggers have made the other msitmmb members feel unwelcome, I apologize." so after said all this, u cant avoid someone based on existing bloggers view.

 just came from the doc.. she cleaned up the wound and applied ointment... it was soo painful... when she was cleaning the wound with a cotton I just danced on the bed... then asked me if I fell on a muddy ground or road or somewhere else... I told on a road.. then she gave a TT injection also... now, my hand is also paining... and prescribed some tablets and asked to continue applying soframycin...

 Good to see a long post about Ajayan and Vijay. It's been a long time since Sindhu blogged. Hope she isn't too busy. No news about the colors yet. Ram and Kavi, don't send your replies to my office id. Either blog it or send it to my postmark id.

 Hi, I was a bit over-enthusiastic this sunday... and played cricket with my house-mates with some extra energy... and got badly hurt in the right leg... don't want to to describe the injury... but its bad... am literally walking on one leg... and didn't have a good sleep for the last 2 days because of the pain... going to see the doc today afternoon...

 Yesterday it went really nice. Myself, Ajayan and Senthil(my friend) left our home around 12pm in two bikes for purchasing dresses for ajayan. i think everyone know ajayan's another name, ie., Royal. if anyone doesnt know, then dont worry at the end of this blog u ll come to know it. First we went to Nungambakkam High Road and get into "Cavin Kellys" show room, after commenting abt all the dresses present there, atlast ajayan selected a trouser, fortunately for his size that model was not available. i said fortunately bcos we wanted to escape from there without buying anything, so now we got a reason for that and escaped from there. Then we went to the "Basics" showroom which is also present in the same road. Ajayan only showed interest in seeing all the dress, but hasnt interested in buy one. but this time i didnt want him to escape from there, so i thought of kozhi pudichifying him, senthil too helped me, so senthil and myself ran here and there and selected some shirts and one of us told ajayan this one was really superb, then other one opposed, no da this one suits u better. but after putting all those efforts ajayan told in a very cool manner, ok i select this shirt but we hav enough time, so why dont we go to some other show rooms and come back in the evening and take this shirt. but somehow senthil convinced him and made him to buy a shirt. so he took almost 2 hours to buy a single shirt, then we had our lunch at Ceylon hotel. We continued our purchasing, because there is no more show rooms at Nungambakkam High Road, we went to Pondy Bazaar. There we went to "Derby" show room. Here Ajayan selected a trouser immediately, bcos that trouser matched very well to the shirt we bought earlier. Ajayan told come on we can continue our purchasing, bcos he needs to buy one more pair. but senthil told we can go some where else. Muttukkadu ---------- So we started to Muttukadu, it is famous for its backwater and boating. it is 30kms away from our place and it lies in ECR(East Coast Roadways). it was a very nice experience to drive in this road, the people who travelled in this road know y i m saying like this, bcos it is difficult to find such a road in our Tamilnadu. After rasichifying the crowd for sometime, we decided to take a boat along with a helper. once our boat moved little bit, ajayan got the oar from the helper and he begin to row the boat. initially he struggled, but after that he did well. asai yaarai vittathu? so i too tried, the helper patiently told me how to ride 3 to 4 times, but even after that i havnt did well, so he took incharge. after that we walked to the centre of the bridge present over that backwater and stand there and viewed the sea from there, it was amazing to see the sea from that view. then we started from there to our place(T.Nagar). Continued purchasing --------- ---------- After returned to our home from muttukkadu, ajayan again started saying abt purchasing, so avan thondharavu thanga mudiyama, we started from our place. but it was almost 7.30 at that time, still we went to Madura Garments factory outlet, which is present in Velachery. we reached there by 7.45, but the security told they closed it 7pm itself. I was too hungry, so I thought of having some snacks, so we went to a Food World present in Velachery. We only entered to buy something to korichifying, but ended with a Rs.800 bill, bcos senthil and ajayan potti pottu kittu bought axe effect,this effect and that effect. i silently watched all these things and when we came out it was 8.30, but ajayan was still strong in his points, said that we hav to buy dress now itself. so we went back to our home, left the vehicles there and ran to Jeyachandran textiles. There he bought a Van Heusen shirt and Sparky trouser. Appada, oru vazhiya ajayan dress eduthu mudithan. Have u now understand what Royal means? To wind up the day we had our usual beef rice and special milk and we went to bed. Note:- ------- If i bored u with this blog, then u can very well scold valli, bcos she only mentioned that if i continuously send msgs in general then she ll rename my name. so who is going to take the honor of scolding her first? a kind request, i dont know to use a better word in place of scolding, i searched in online dictionaries, even i had come up with lot of words, i dont know whether i can use them in this place or not, so pls post some synonyms for scolding with examples of where & how to use it. this is the nice opportunity for everyone, bcos in the examples u can use the name of the person whom u like(?) most. it is default that u all like(?) me most, so dont use my name, use some others name.

 Hi everyone, I have added a few more color schemes to the block. You can select it through Switch Styles option. Hope you like the colour schemes.

 Hmmmm... ding..ding...ding... my bells are ringing.. The "good looking" Anitha is coming to Bangalore... jax, am open to invite any of our people.. so long as they are participating its good for all...

 Hi all, I have got requests from Kurinji and Sriprasath to join us. Shall i invite them? bye for now,

 Hi, Now on to my views... Its been kinda fancy in some channels to project countries like India and its poverty in the most "pathetic" ever way possible... A few programmes I could recollect... AXN - there was some travel program where India's railway stations and a typical sleeper class coach was shown to be "dirty and stinky"... they showed a beggar begging in the platform and the program host was emotional and said "this is poverty for u"... Naional Geographic.. a quiz program was on... and the question was "What does an Indian style toilet comprise?" and the answer "A hole in the ground".. imagine some non-Indian hearing this... what would he imagine of a "hole in the ground" being used as a toilet... and in one program in BBC there was an interview with some guy (an Indian), I forgot who... he was talking about how India is perceived by other nations.. and what he told was "Some people still think India is a country of kings and demons... while there are others too, who understand India as an intellectual capital.." But my question is, does America stand any differnt... In fact, the so-called Americans do not even belong there... the native Americans (also known as Indians or red-Indians) are the actual natives who were overthrown by the British/European settlers... the native Americans live in ridges and valleys and most are not even aware that something called electricity exists... they are still a century behind in development... who is to be blamed.. the so-called Americans... (this part is courtesy: Oprah Winfrey show)... But still we are left at the mercy of being projected in whatever way the world likes to see us.. We do have shortcomings... we are poor compared to other developed nations... education levels are lesser.. no doubt... but are the other countries spotless...??? Its only that, we are still dependant on the heftier nations... and they wouldn't hesitate to pass such actions... after all, they call the shots... But its only a question of time... it could be a few decades... and India might well be seen atleast much better positioned than what it is now...

 Hi All, How are you doing? I know I am not in the loop for more than a month. But I cudn't get away with all my work. We have one delivery next month starting . Till then I will be in office till night 1 or 2AM. My team is so nice..so I am not getting bugged of this. Hey..valli u know anitha got placed in DSL adn she will be moving to bangalore tomorrow. Bye!

 Sure Valli, I know what typing is, but I don't know how to type. I'm more of a four-finger typist. I use two fingers of each hand to type. But interestingly, a couple of days ago, I got to a site where I found a software to help type pout text faster on the screen. It is really an innovative piece of software. It is titled urlLink Dasher . It sure looks good. I am trying it out right now. The s/w is very small in size (about 580 kb). Try it out. Valli, why don't you try voice recognition s/w. It is available in Office Xp. All you need is a good microphone and some time to spare. Once you get the voice recognition trained to recognize your voice, you can reduce your typing to a great extent. Any help in this regard, contact me. Will get back to the discussion later. I've got an interesting question for all of you.

 Hi, Great to see so many soothing words Yep Rini, i read that article, as soon as it was posted....The moral was really good....but the style, it was presented ...was a bit tuff....I lose the ultimate point to be grasped in such cases......The author is right....we are losing our spiritual & Cultural integrity......need to debug all those corruptions....... If i'm right, Ganesh is getting closer to stuffs offered in polytechnic schools. & his idea of "Work while u learn" is something very very very important, that has to be inculcated in our system......When students stand independently, they get the confidence to fulfil their dreams.....I really had that feel of personal satisfaction, when a group of us, worked in the Samsung exhibition..... wanted to share many more views with you.....but, i don't know...somehow it takes a long time for me to type ...Xavier do u know typing?..... I have my Dental appointment this evening (just the regural check-up & cleaning stuffs. It's just one of those attractive offers, our insurance company gives us). My dentist is a soft lady, who does her work so sincerely, that she flosses so hard inbetween my teeth & end up in making my gums bleed!!!

 dear ganesh this is bala and rajesh.where r u and what are u doing?call us in 9843336512 as soon as u see this mesg raapi

 Hi, Regarding valli's opinion, i think we should not care much about what is shown in foreign media. but there r a lot of things that have to be done here in India regarding education. I personally think that our education system needs a lot of changes. A lot of factors can be said regarding why poor people do not send their children to school. but that can be changed by bringing in few changes. This iam saying with those poor children in mind. my views on what can be changed are: 1. It is waste of time in having so many subjects in our syllabus. we study history & geography right from 1st to 10th standard. the same old wars, asoka, buddha, india, ocean, mountains etc. these subjects can be stopped in 5th standard. i think basic english, maths & science is more than enough. what importantly can be taught is other subjects related to work. for eg like carpentry, painting etc. there r so many in this world. this can be taught after say 12 years of age. by this he can also earn some money along with his education. but then we may hear a few voices which will say there should be no child labour. we think we should not care about it. if a child enjoys what he is doing then how can it be harmful to him. he will only gain more by expereince. this will not be a 12 hours job which some children go thru now. he will also get time to enjoy his youth. Goverment should play a important role in this. it is giving so many subsidies for so many unwanted things. those can be reduced or stopped and this kind of education should be encouraged. then only we will see a next generation which thinks logically, votes to select the leader he wants, which is not poor etc. See kicha, abdul kalam cannot come every where for everything. it is we who should do something. we r the present generation and it is in our hands to do something may be after another 5 years of time. We should be happy that these kind of issues r being discussed here. but it is also important that we play a role in implementing atleast some of them. bye

 Hi all, I have included a stylesheet switcher. As of now I have included only one style sheet. You can now choose either a black based stylesheet or a white and gray based style sheet. The option is available just above the search blog option. Try it out. Your comments are welcome.

 Hei they are in 2003 folder of our group photos album. Hei have u subscribed to our groups thru yahoo id? Only then u can access these, else u cant. Hope u have. Regarding education portrayal, the scenario is going to change ma. Slowly there is an awareness in people about this. U r also an example of it. the anger in u is an example that u deny the fact that the education that what we get in India is not as low as whats been portrayed. But then its obviously low when compared to the intellectual property possessed by our forerunners. Similarly in most of the fields we are depicted with low values which we have never cared to give enough attention and we let it go astray. But then now people are realising that its not the case. And i think in forth coming days, we will surely try to behave more refined and prove them that, the notion which others carry, about our nation is not true. To make this happen it needs proper understanding of our culture and live as an execution of it to them. If u read the article which i had posted a few days ago about Education in India, it will help u understand the underlying facts that obviously we are far to go in certain things. Yes to set right things which were made wrong by british is a mamoth task, but then there is always a hope in me that it will happen. What u speak about here is the external facts of the current education system. To be frank it seems, its the poverty that made u feel anger and by the peripheral things we cant judge the education system. Read that article once again to have more light on current system of education and how britishers were higly successful in achieving what he needed. Yes, he wanted us to become a foreigner in our own land and here we are good example of it. He could wisely cut us off from all the treasured knowledge and let us squander thru all the nasty meanders of the dark part of life and let us not think but only work as said. How tragic its to imagine the once so rich nation, not so long ago, probably around 250 years ago whose % in world trade was 25% of the world trade is now having just 0.5% as its share in world trade. But USA whose history dates not so long back, and which dint exist few hundred years ago is now doing 25% of the world trade. How we have left all our riches to drain....... Got some work now, will continue in next blog Ranjini

 Hi Valli, The other things like social conditions, plight of women and also working conditions at times project our nation in a bad light. I would agree that a few portions are true. But generalisation of the conditions as Indian is unacceptable. Blogger has changed a few of its services. Expect a lot more of these changes in the future. A spell check option is also available.

 Hi, Today is my project's delivery.. please pray that my modules do not throw up any defect at this stage... Let the delivery go on peacefully... (uh, feels just like a mother waiting to deliver her baby)... Irrespective of whether I'll be released from the project or retained for the 1 month warranty period, atleast the work pressure should reduce, hopefully... so that I can be back to my old form... Got a lot of things to tell about Valli's query... will post them peacufully next week...

 hey Rini, un photos enga dhaan vaechirukka????........groups la, naan thaedaadha link illa...........

 hi Xavier, I understand that, the literacy rate is not 100% & that there are villages which have'nt even got a pre-school...... irundhaalum aethukka mudiyala.......U had mentioned that majority of us are poor....are'nt the majority of us in middle class?.....I thought it to be so..... we'll hope for the best in the future.....hope that our President, who knows the real value of education takes some serious measures to cultivate literacy on all nook 'n corners of our nation...... what else is projected in a way, not so appealing, Xavier? I see some difference in the composing screen......what's happening?......seems to be good......

 It is true that India is being projected as such in foreign televisions. I can understand your anger. But you would have to admit that it is the truth. A large percentage of our population live in rural areas where education per se has no value at all. There is an ad going around in Indian TV channels showing a young girl (a Rajasthani or Gujarati girl) going for an eye checkup. The doctor (a lady) asks her to read the eyechart. The girl remains silent. The doctor once agains asks her to read. Yet the girl is silent. Then the girl's father says softly she cannot read. My first reaction on seeing the ad for the first time was rage (on the girl's father for not sending his daughter to the school.) The next couple of times I saw the ad, I noticed the dresses and the condition of the girl and her parents. They were poor people. The truth hit me. They do want to send thier daughter to school but they cannot afford it. You can see it in their eyes. Then my anger turned to pity. I can recall a similar incident told by my aunt. This happenned in Madurai, just opposite our MK University. My aunt, working in MKU school, says that she finds it difficult to get children to come to school from the nearby areas. A parent told this to her she asked him why he was not sending his son to school. &quot;I am a stone breaker. I get around x ruppees every day. My son if he works with will also earn around some x ruppees. We can use this money for our daily gruel. If my son goes to study, we will have to forgo a certain amount of money every day which we cannot. Additionally, we might also have to bear the education costs. So I will send my son to study if I am somehow assured of getting the same amount of money that my son will earn if he works.&quot; How would you answer this question? The problem is that a majority of the people in India are poor. It is a truth that we Indians should accept first. Secondly, the cost of education is high, as you might have known. Thirdly, the cost of educating a student is also high. A government has to spend a lot in terms of infrastructure, salaries and other things. So what can be done? You cannot blame the people; you cannot blame the government. The least you can do is wring your hands in despair. Yet all is not lost. We can change things through several ways. How you can change things is best left to the individual to decide. But things have to be changed. Indian education is not the only thing that is shown in a bad light in foreign media. So what can be done on that? your thoughts... Here are a couple of quotes on education. To prepare us for complete living is the function which education has to discharge. -- H. Spenser. Education : That which discloses to the wise and disguises from the foolish their lack of understanding. Which of the above is more true? You decide...

 hey, yesterday evening, while having dinner, i was just switching over channels looking out for any game shows or talk shows. I ended up in one of the state local channels, which concentrates on kids.....they telecast kids shows & try to teach them something evrytime......yesterday, they were telecasting a documentary with the topic "Education in other countries"....for the rest of the post, just imagine the reels u used to watch in theatres before the actual movie being played...... First came a poor Japenese kid (10 yrs).....wakes up in the morning, has their kind of breakfast (inbetween he talks to the camera, which is being translated for us)Japan seems to be very clean, his outfits are really good, his classroom is very tidy, he comes back home & relaxes himself in a bath tub(remember he's poor).....Then a poor girl from Benin was shown (same 10 yrs).....has two sisters & two brothers(she too talks the same way to the camera, describing their life style).....her mother lost her job when the last baby was born......she's wearing torn out clothes, her bros were with shorts.......If the kids go to school their mom will get a stypend of $15/month & a packet of food everyday.....her class room is just a small hut, with 60 other kids in her class....they are asked to practise writing alphabets & numbers on the walls.....In the evning, they cook somehting, thta looks like porridge & everybody has that for dinner.....then came an poor Indian girl, named Neeraj.....from a village in Rajasthan......she did'nt know her age correctly.....she's going for school only for the past one yr....that too, night school, where only girls learn....she's already engaged to a guy, & will get married in another 5 to 6 yrs.....the whole morning, she works in her in-law's home.....evening she goes to school....but the guys, they go to the morning school.....her granny says education is a waste for her grand daughter.....only life'll teach her.....they cook in mud stoves (three stones on three corners, firewood in between)the place around is not tidy at all......they have roti for dinner( which was told as dry bread here)......& then came a Rumanian kid, then a brazilian kid & one another kid from south Africa....... Finally their conclusion was, the kids from Japan & Rumania....their education is safe it seems, & hence thier lives too,....but for kids form the other developing nations, their education is not so promising, it seems.....So, when a kid here, watches this show, u know how he picturasizes India in his mind. I was really wondering.....are Kids like Neeraj, the majority in India....Shld this how, India be picturarised?.....I do agree that, there are kids who can'y afford to go to school in India.....but to give a true picture of India & Indian kids(any country for that matter), they shld have taken a kid from a middle class family (Which is the majority of our country)....ennavo oru inam puriyaadha kovam.....is my anger worthy enough????guys, need ur inputs on this.......

 Forgot to add the link... Read full-story about the Telstra project urlLink here .

 B R E A K I N G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N E W S ... Infosys bags $50 mn contract from Telstra Indian software major Infosys has signed a five-year $50 million contract with Australian telecom and information systems giant Telstra for software development and maintenance and is planning to open a development centre down under. Infosys will be taking over the work, which was earlier carried out by IBM Global Services Australia, formerly a joint venture between Telstra, IBM and Land Lease. Infosys is also looking at office space for a development centre in Australia for which it plans to hire 250 employees.

 yesterday i went to kumarapalayam to attend my colleague's marriage function. after that function was over i started to coimbatore to meet our friends there. from the moment i landed in coimabatore xavier took incharge of me. from there onwards i was totally under his control, he took me to a nice hotel(where we had our breakfast during our coimbatore-ooty tour) and ordered whatever he liked, sorry whatever I liked, vittah sappittu mudichathum kaiyila rupaayum kuduthiruppan. after lunch i waited in a browsing center for either xavier or bala or rajesh to come after finishing their work. xavier came back from the office and picked me, then we went to bala's office, he hasnt turned out from the field. so xavi took me to his house, there xavier provided me a nice bed to take rest, original home made coffee and kerala chips to refresh. bala and rajesh came there when i just started to see the movie "kakka kakka". imsainga vantha vudanae off pannittanuka. antha padathai theatrela poi than parkanumam, yenna avanukallukku theatrela ticket kidaikkalaiyam, so naanum athu mathiri kastappadanumam. rajesh told abt his first day exp, may be he ll post it. thank God, around 8.30pm they left xavier's house, i m waiting for that moment for long time. bcos, xavier's mom prepared idly for me. so once they left, xavier asked me to take idlies, but it was 8.45 at that time, actually that was the reporting time for my bus. my watch was showing only 8.30, then only i realized it has slowed down. i thought of skip the dinner and start from there, but xavier, his mom and dad havnt allowed me, they compelled me to eat idly. nice idlies but i took only 3 as i dont hav time, his mom alos prepared paayasam, wow it was really superb, but due to time constraint i had only 4 spoons. yenna tastu, unmaiyilaiyae supera irunthuchu. BTW, xavier called to KPN travels and informed that i m on the way and asked them to wait for me. i not even told his mom abt her samaiyal and left the place. xavier dropped me in KPN travels exactly when the bus was abt to start. omitting bala and rajesh from the scene, i had a very nice time in coimbatore. xavierukku romba nandri kadan pattirukken. this morning around 7.30am i reached chennai safely. intha kadhai ithudan mudinthathu. ithil kurappatta sambavangal anaithum unmaiyae. so ithu yaar manathaiyum punnakkinaal, marunthu poda kaasu kodukka pada maattathu.

 Hi guys, as our mail server had some problem, we couldnt access net for the past two days and so i had a tough time working all the work hours. Anyway it helped me do a lot of things which were pending and gear up my way of work. Hei one more news guys, really speaking i have joined carnatic vocal classes from last week and hope to continue. Not only that, i have also joined Classical dance class too. Adha mattum yen viduvanennu thaan. But ya its for my sake i am learning and not for entertaining others. So people dont worry, i wont test u to hear all my songs. Innum kathukkave aarambikkala adhukkula ippadi oru padam pottutu irukken. both are tough and i wish to manage it atleast for a year or so. Wish me u all please! Hei thanx for ur response to RWH, though i couldnt read much due to net problem. Once its set right i will read and post back my opinion to our cm rajesh. Jax that article was sent by srini and i dont know where from he had picked it up. It ofcourse was a controversial article in his group and thought such discussion would be triggered in our group too and posted it and i could see no response. Its ok, it happens. Valli where r u photos? Have u made me eligible to access? If so send me the link. Ok. by the way i have uploaded my snaps on to our group , there are few which i dint send to u people. so check out for those in our group. Ganesh "Midnight walking" made me feel that u r going to review some english movie. Never thought u were the hero of that movie. Thrilling it would have been..... Hei i forgot to tell u guys .... cha blunder of my life! Ofcourse, u people know that i am not interested in watching movies and for the first time, srini was successful in convincing me to go to a movie. He told , the movie choice was mine. I am totally untouuhed by any movie these days and i know only those which my colleagues or friends talk about, or the one whose critic or review i read. Other than that i was totally cut from movie world. Dint know which movie to go..... But then remembered that "Koi Mil gaya" got released and read about it in some magazine and heard one of my colleague telling about the demand for the movie tickets and many hye stories about the movie and opted for that. So we along with 2 of his friends decided to go for the movie and started..... Kadavule padam poi utkaarntha illa theriyuthu, namma oor Jagan mohinila varra alavukku kooda maayajaalam illatha uppu chappu illatha Kolanthainga padam. I was bugged up totally. Such a nasty acting by Hrithik and very weak story line. I had a good headache when i came out of the theatre u know. Dhath......... But then he had to get me Pineapple papaya ice cream @ Baskin robbins to get rid of that nasty feeling of having watched a kothu movie. Adhu supera irundathu. It was hyped in a way that i imagined it to be full of graphics, special effects and my disappointment was deeper than Mariana's trench. Cha inime padame nee paarkaama irukarthu thaan nallathunnu srini feel panra alavukku aaiyi pochu en nilamai. Really my hope on movies got lost like anything. The worst part was, the two friends who accompanied us knew that the movie was not that good and still they made way, since i had opted for. Really it was sick saturday evening this weekend. Ok then will blog more about my weekend tales in my next blog if my n/w is set right. till then bye

 Kicha, it's good to hear that your project is almost over. Looking forward for lots of posts on the difficulties you might have faced during your project. Ganja, what was it about you being a cowboy? Has the Tiruchi sun affected you? Valli, the photos were nice, Sindhu where are your photos of your UK roundings? Vijay, hope you reached Chennai safely? Manny and Kavi, how is Chennai now, hot or cold? Rini and Ram, any interesting news? Seems both of you are very busy for the past week.

 Hi, Its been a while and I've been tied up a lot with my stupid project. This weekend it will be delivered to the customer. Irrespctive of whether I'll be released from it or retained for the 1 month warranty, I hope the work pressure to come back to normal over the next week. Amidst all the hurdles I faced in the project - both attitude-wise and otherwise... a few things this has taught me - What it means to have a "work stress". I'm reminded of all the stress management workshops where we had skits and other performances on how to handle stress. It was such great fun doing all that stuff in college days.. but facing it is altogether a different matter. Its a test of nerves, as I see it. Another aspect I've learnt... my usual dept is the R&D unit (called SETLabs, as u might know)... where its only research that happens and very little interaction with the customers.. if at all we interact with customers, it would be for some requirement analysis or consulting and never for any kind of delivery work. But project is an entirely different thing. The moment u have someone called customer to deal with, it no longer remains the conventional 9-5 job. As we've learnt "Customer is King... (and blah..blah..)".. Now I know why he is the king... and how he has to be treated. Third point... Leadership... my PL at SETLabs is a person who takes utmost care of his words and would make sure, he get things done in the kindest possible way.. but still make it clear that he means business... But it was the other extreme in the project... I would rate the project's PL 4/10 on leadership qualities while rate my PL 8/10. And I learnt a lot of things here too... I remember a quote that I used in one of Mr.Raja G'swamy's class.. "If u want to be good, u have to know what is not good".. in similar lines, I learnt how just a little way of speaking demoralizes the entire team.. I learnt all about what a leader should not do.. coz I was the one suffering... Its been a really hard struggle for me over the last 2.5 months or so in this project.. its not over yet... but atleast not a very long way to go (hopefully)...

 Yesterday, Rajesh and Bala had come over to Coimbatore to search for houses. Beofre embarking on thier search, they came to visit me and later on we went to see Karthiga. I promised them I will look at a few houses, which of course I did. They saw a few houses and didn't like them. I guess Rajesh will be posting about his house-hunt shortly. Today, Had a surprise. Vijay Babu was in town. After lunch, I left him at a browsing center to spend his time. More later.

 Temporarily I have disabled Ajayan, Kathu and Sangee's accounts. I'll enable them as soon as I get an intimation from them.

 Hei Jax, Your quote is superb.... By way, It seems MSITMMB groups is in Hight Spirit... Cheers

 hi, yesterday i had said that a mgmt skill is necessary. For example if a person is an extrovert he may be suitable for marketing etc. so for identifying that the workshop would be helpful and most important is with a professor like Mr Raja Govindaswamy. I will suggest the following tips for persons who wish to get into marketing. First choose a city where u think there r more oppurtunities for marketing . for eg chennai, bangalore etc. U should know the local language of that particular city like tamil or kannada.this is a must because without local language u cannot go & speak to a local customer. Have a definition of marketing and the difference between marketing & sales always in ur purse.becoz as a fresher these r the two definite questions they will ask in an interview if u go as a fresher.(Questions out pannitenna hehehe) I always keep one & still i have it with me.(i know u r all laughing because i used to bit adichify in exams & it continues even in interviews) Second delete all the IT projects & packages u know from ur resume. u can include at the most Ms office.( padichethalleam waste aaa ) Third after joining in a job the same evening post ur resume in all the job websites & keep applying for all the jobs u see. If u r in a company which is big (say for eg Reliance ) u will definitely get atleat 5 calls for interview in a week. If u get a good offer with a hike in salary go for that job. this process can go on till u settle down into a good company where u think there will be growth and where there is good salary. These r the tips i can give with my expereince so far in marketing and sales. Bye

 Don’t show our degree certificate at any cost to the employer when you have cleared your written test and tech interview...ha ha…coz if you do so...you may have to regret for your blunder...

 By kidding Vijay Babu, I have heared advices / suggestions from most of you people, Thanks, Thanks again..... Yeah coming to mine...... What we lacked (I Certainly see & feel in my job career) is v r not aware of the exact things going on in the business world while v r doing our studies..... V had a wonderfull opportunity for spending 1 month of First year vacation in a company.... But most of us didnt used it properly.... But I am not frustrated with my current job (my first job) coz we should accept whatever we get and tune overself towards what we can provide in this job; side by side sharpenning our saw (i.e, core competancy, or ur life aim whatever you put) than to get sulk over the issues arrising out of the current job.... What I have mentioned above is for tuning yourself for a long term career..... I go with Vijay's suggestion for an immediate get thru for a job after studies.... To succeed in life.... The same thing "THINK WIN - u r sure to win" Thinking any one can do... But u should feel u r winning.... crossing a pebble over the expeditition towards Everest is also a situation where u have won.... Believe u can do with full cofidence not even a nanocm less that that... then u have achieved. yeah, rest personally.... Cheers Ram

 Hi, Getting back to my routine, after a good Family Re-Union(??!! that's what they call it here )......they were here for five days.......had so much fun....toured around places.....cooked good food for them.....& now, i'm all alone......the same sulking lonliness......getting used to it again..... I've uploaded my photos to the album "Red River Gorge". All the bloggers can see them at urlLink photos Has snaps of the past two weeks.......i've just added a few for now.....maybe i'll add a few more in the weeks to come....since, i hook up to the net using my phone, it takes hours to upload photos...... As usual, we had our Java class yesterday & obviously, i was the only beautiful young gal.......Rajesh, eppo meet panna poroem, legalaa????...... dharmam, niyaayam ellam en pakkam......what does that M.L stands for after ur name man??? fraud fraud 420...... Rini, where exactly, are your photos in the groups??....i was searching under the photos & files link...but could'nt find it...... Nice discussions going around.....I missed all the posts for a week..... now got to speed up & streamline with u guys.......

 Hi, I am giving my views on what juniors could do : 1) I think when doing our course itself they should be adept in IT & any one of the mgmt side also(may be marketing or hr or finance which ever they r good in) To fine out in which they r good in i think our workshop on mgnt skills will be of great help. because if u see 50 % of the people today the work they r doing will be irrelevant to their education. so i do not think in todays job market they should restrict themselves to IT alone. more on this tomorrow. bye

 hi, I didnt mean to post my last msg.....i was typing 1 or 2 lines inbetween my work.....dont know what i did...it's in blog!!! anyway...thank you Xavier, your link abt RWH cleared my head. Regarding Vijay Babu's question...as most of you said...i am not sure either....cos i want to change my job now..but dont know what field to choose....im in real limbo....in UK mgt job means sales and marketing.....the title may differ from company to company but the role is the same.....telemarketing!!!.....i dont want that sort of job....i want a mgt job in an IT company....this is what im doing right now! my current job profile is ok but not the company.....when i try to look out for a job there is not much scope for me.... all I can tell our juniors is.......be focussed in what you want.....develop your core competencies in the chosen field! All the plans for TN govt sounds promising....just waiting for the day we see the result! bcos all I do is compare the atmosphere in here with what we got in India......v really wonder many times...' when these dumb heads can have such sophisticated living, why not we, who are much more superior and advanced in technology? ' as far as im concerned....the core reason for what India is today is ' CORRUPTION '.....i dont say corruption doesnt exist here....it does....but not for petty things and more importantly when it comes to the question of people's welfare! bye

 dear ranjini see these links also http://www.dinamalar.com/RWH/index.asp http://www.dinamalar.com/2003aug09/fpnews5.asp http://www.dinamalar.com/2003sep03/fpnews1.asp hope this would help you in getting a view about the real reason and seriousness behind the implementation of RWH in Tamilnadu raapi

 everyone responded very well for the topic "career guidance to our juniors". i assume that i know something more than what our juniors know abt job market and tell the following to them. for the people who interested in mgmt - many of u think of getting into a marketing job. no problem for u, as far as u dont consider the company & the product/service u r going to market. but if u want to get into a good company, prepare general apptitude well, bcos most of the companies r conducting written test as part of screening process. thorough with basic concepts of marketing, that ll be helpful to u in the interview. for the people who interested in IT - software development - u hav to be good in apptitude, C, C++(basics) & the technology in which u did the projects. definitely u can get into a good company. dont worry abt the companies which r not allowing M.Sc to take up the test, bcos only very few companies r like that. contacts r very important in IT field, so try to establish ur network, that ll get u the opportunities. people who interested in getting into technical field but not interested in software development - u have got plenty of other opportunities like software testing, Call centres providing technical support, Content Development, etc. in general dont give up at any point of time. u ll succeed. -vijay

 To be honest, I simply dont understand what ' rainwater harvest pit ' is or how its being made....I will really appreciate if someone could explain me the logic behind it! Rajesh...all the plans sound interesting

 On education : Rini, a very good use of an interesting article. I would like to know the source of the article. It seems familiar but I don't remember where I read it. Universities are a fount of knowledge. Some come to drink, some just to gargle. On RWH : You hit the nail on the head when you said that planning alone is not going to solve any problems. Execution is the other part (reference: our Principles of Management class). I had read an interesting article in the Sunday edition of Hindu a few years back. I don't know if it is available online. I hope, in addition to Rajesh's reference, you have the time to visit urlLink this link . It is wonderfully written with lots and lots of examples and diagrams. As you had said, everyone is forced to invest in a rainwater harvesting system without undestanding why it is required or how it should be implemented. I have never seen anything in the media in the recent past highlighting how RWh is to be implemented. All I had seen is our CM delivering a monologue on the benefits and reprecussions if you don't install RWH. Now every house has a RWH, but will it function as intended is to be seen in the days to come. I have also posted another post in urlLink "Quod scripsi, scripsi" for your perusal. I may not be updating it daily, but I'll inform you if I update it.

 hi rini you can see the details and tips reg RWH in http://www.chennaimetrowater.com/rainwatermain.htm see this and post your views further raapi

 Good rajesh, it helped me to get a picture of what current TN govt. is planning. but then i would be happy to listen that all these plans have fruitified rather than a change of govt. left all these plans at the planning stage itself. I think, its not one of the election stunt which politicians usually do. Has there been any accomplished tasks by our govt. recently, apart from planning? And did all ur people have ur houses dug up with rain water harvest pits? Yes, its there at my place and also at my inlaws place. Hope these pits not to disappear in years time with all mud on road. Rajesh has our CM made any provision to insist that these pits should be left open or covered properly and not become waste in course of time? The sad thing is, most of them are trying to just make a pit and put some stone(jalli) and then let the water get into it rather than adopting the exact method of stuffing with charcoal, fine sand, coarse sand and things like that. Hei guys, can u come up with how the pit should be stuffed? If i am clear about how it should be, then i am interested in submitting a proposal of insisting to check the healthy condition of pits once in a year or insist that if not. And on to Vijay babu's ques, i like answering to it with a quote in general on the current Indian Education system . Here starts the quote............. (I have posted it onto our groups too) One of the most remarkable features of British rule in India has been the fact that the greatest injuries done to the people of India have taken the form of blessings. Of this, Education is a striking example; for no more crushing blows have ever been struck at the roots of Indian National evolution than those which have been struck, often with other, and the best intentions, in the name of Education.... The most crushing indictment of this Education is the fact that it destroys, in the great majority of those upon whom it is inflicted, all capacity for the appreciation of Indian culture. Speak to the ordinary graduate of an Indian University, or a student from Ceylon, of the ideals of the Mahabharata he will hasten to display his knowledge of Shakespeare; talk to him of religious philosophy you find that he is an atheist of the crude type common in Europe a generation ago, and that not only has he no religion, but he is as lacking in philosophy as the average Englishman; talk to him of Indian music he will produce a gramophone or a harmonium, and inflict upon you one or both; talk to him of Indian dress and jewellery he will tell you that they are uncivilized and barbaric; talk to him of Indian art it is news to him that such a thing exists; ask him to translate for you a letter written in his own mother-tongue he does not know it. He is indeed a stranger on his own land. It is hard to realize how completely the continuity of Indian life has been severed. A single generation of English education suffices to break the threads of tradition and to create a nondescript and superficial being deprived of all roots a sort of intellectual pariah who does not belong to the East or the West, the past or the future. The greatest danger for India is the loss of her spiritual integrity. Of all Indian problems the educational is the most difficult and most tragic. Ananda Coomaraswamy There is a need for change in the education ssytem as such and i dont know to comment on what we got in our Master's! I really wonder what we get in Universities and educational institution now a days is the true education! When i myself is not clear about it, i dont want to advice others and confuse them too. so leave them to decide on education for their choice. Adhayum choicela vidaama irundha sari!!!!!!!!!!

 jax give me your id to which i can send a document.just fill it and give it to me .it is urgent and also a step in my interview with amtex

 You can also post your ideas to chiefministers cell by using the following id cmcell@tn.gov.in if you are doing so also send me a copy of it rajesh

 with reference to our discussion reg environment awareness we had on blogger a few months b4 here are some steps that are taken by tamilnadu government.Tell your views about this and if you have some suggestions kindly publish it here so that it can also be submitted to the government. The Tamil Nadu Government is turning a welcome shade of green with Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa announcing a series of measures to protect animals and the environment. From banning animal sacrifice and protecting elephants to cleaning Chennai's famed Marina Beach and enforcing rainwater systems in every house, Jayalalithaa is doing it all. And most of it has happened in the last fortnight alone. The immediate provocation for banning animal sacrifice came from a complaint about 500 buffaloes being "sacrificed to God" in a village in Tiruchirapalli district with senior police officials watching. "A ban is already in force under the Tamil Nadu Animals and Birds Prevention of Sacrifice Act of 1950. However, the provisions of the Act are often breached. Therefore, people should be educated not to do so," said a letter from the Chief Minister to district heads. She also ordered that the senior police official present at the spot be suspended. For political expediency or otherwise, Jayalalitha has supported the proposed federal legislation for a ban on cow slaughter. Responding to reports of a temple elephant running amok and injuring its mahout because it was "too stressed out" and another being forced to beg on Chennai streets, Jayalalitha took several corrective measures to "de-stress" captive pachyderms. Elephants used and kept in Tamil Nadu's temples have been granted a holiday for the first time in their lives. Moreover, the government has ordered that all temple elephants be kept in a camp for one month in a year. The one-month camp would not only be a holiday but also an occasion for an annual compulsory health check up. Jayalalitha has asked officials to ensure that all 41 temple elephants in Tamil Nadu temples, on government records, are taken to the rest camps. Besides, a coordination committee with representatives from the government and the temples have been entrusted with the task of identifying distressed elephants. And there is still more. To take tips on how to go about the job, a special team of experts has been formed to study protection and healthcare measures for elephants in Guruvayur temple in neighbouring Kerala. On another front, the Jayalalitha government's environment activism has resulted in a compulsory rainwater harvesting system in every building in Tamil Nadu. The deadline for implementation is August 31. If buildings don't comply, municipalities will enforce the system and cut fresh water connections from the corporations. The Marina beach in Chennai too has been cleaned up vigorously by the civic authorities, which even demolished all old structures on the beach last week. Enforcement agencies would keep a vigil to ensure that people don't litter the beach. The government has this week also come out with a notice to fishermen asking them to confine fishing only to specially demarcated areas. The department of fisheries held a meeting this week to give notice to the millions of fishermen working in the state's 1,000-km coastline through the Tamil Nadu Fishermen's Union. Besides, the government has been working at Tamil Nadu's largest vegetable wholesale market on the outskirts of Chennai to generate 5,000 units of power every day from bio-waste. To be set up at a cost of Rs 5 crore, the plant would supply power to the market itself. This bio-methanon plant would be supported by the ministry of non-conventional energy and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Another pet project is Enviro Vision 2005 set up to monitor the quality of air, water and land resource in Tamil Nadu as part of a 15-point agenda for development. A federal grant of Rs 492 crore is being used to clean up Chennai's five canals and rivers. When complete, the city river conservation project will help plug the 422 outlets into the waterways flowing through Chennai. A Rs 37 crore project to stop sewage flow into the Cauvery river is also being implemented. Many more plans are expected

 I really wish I had urlLink this .

 I guess most of you might have known about the blog " urlLink Quod scripsi, scripsi " I had started a couple of months back. As that blog will be removed from urlLink Typepad in a few day's time, I am moving to urlLink Blogger . You can view it at urlLink Jax says . I have rehashed a lot of posts from "Quod scripsi, scripsi". I have also included a comments module, so that you all can leave your comments on the post. Bye, for now.

 Rajesh, that was really a thought provoking question and a very interesting solution too. Looking forward to more such philosophical insights. But don't give the answer immediately. Let us post our views first. At times this may also lead to very interesting solutions. Everyone is busy. Vijay, that i2i was very informative. Where were you all these days? Sindhu, No posts from you for quite some time, working hard or roaming around?

 A group of children are playing near two railway tracks, one still in use while the other disused. Only one child is playing on the disused track,the rest on the operational track. The train comes, and you are just beside the track interchange. You could make the train change its course to the disused track and save most of the kids. However, that would also mean the lone child playing by the disused track would be sacrificed. Or would you rather let the train go its way? Let's take a pause to think what kind of decision we could make. Most people might choose to divert the course of the train, and sacrifice only one child. You might think the same way, I guess. Exactly, I thought the same way initially because to save most of the children at the expense of only one child was rational decision most people would make, morally and emotionally.But, have you ever thought that the child choosing to play on the disused track had in fact made the right decision to play at a safe place? Nevertheless, he had to be sacrificed because of his ignorant friends who chose to play where the danger was. This kind of dilemma happens around us everyday. In the office,community, in politics and especially in a democratic society, the minority is often sacrificed for the interest of the majority, no matter how foolish or ignorant the majority are, and how farsighted and knowledgeable the minority are. The child who chose not to play with the rest on the operational track was sidelined. And in the case he was sacrificed, no one would shed a tear for him. The friend who forwarded me the story said he would not try to change the course of the train because he believed that the kids playing on the operational track should have known very well that track was still in use, and that they should have run away if they heard the train's sirens. If the train was diverted, that lone child would definitely die because he never thought the train could come over to that track! While we are all aware that life is full of tough decisions that need to be made, we may not realize that hasty decisions may not always be the right one.

 tonight 10.15 i m starting to Mumbai in Mumbai mail. ranjini i liked ur blog reg., behaviour, character and personality. but really i dont understand the Being u mentioned in the personality.

 The Mercedes Logo The "Mercedes" name was registered right back in 1902, but at that time there was no logo or trademark to accompany it. The idea for the 'Star' logo came when Paul and Adolf Daimler, the two sons of the company's founder (and then in charge of the business) remembered that their father had once used a star symbol in his family correspondence. Their father, Gottlieb Daimler, had been technical director of the Deutz gas engine factory from 1872 until 1881. At the beginning of his employment there, he had marked a star above his own house on a picture postcard of Cologne and Deutz, and had written to his wife that this star would one day shine over his own factory to symbolize prosperity. In June 1909 the company registered both three-pointed and four-pointed stars as trademarks. Although both designs were legally protected, only the three-pointed star was ever used. From 1910 onwards it began to appear at the front of the cars as a design feature on the radiator. The three-points of the star were supposed to represent Daimler's ambition of universal motorization: "on land, on water and in the air". Over the years the logo evolved, to include the 'Benz' laurel wreath, and then, in 1923, the three-pointed star enclosed in a circle was registered as a trademark. Since then it has changed little, and is now a powerful symbol and integral part of the Mercedes-Benz brand.

 Ada paavi, inime ethaachum anupinaa olunga nee eluthinathaa illa vera yaarodathaannu mention pannu ya. no probs let my words of praise soon become true. Ofcourse u too can write like them. And sujatha is not a great writer but ofcourse unique coz of his flare for writing things which are more scientific which very few writers almost none are popular. Some are good, but not all of his works. For me a writer when he attains a level in writing should be able to produce stuffs which are of better or equally good quality and not less than that. If i start feeling so, then i dont feel like getting back to the writer with the same interest as i did earlier but never shun him totally too with the hope that he might produce something better than that. Recent days i felt a sag in his writing and it double up when i read a story of his recently. At the same time, i read Srirangathu Devathaigal in Kumudam or vikadan i dont know and was impressed by his mild strokes of humour and lauded the lifestyle of their fun filled way of living in those days at srirangam except for the last story in the series. Yes when i read the stories, i felt it was true and almost could take me to those days. But then the last one failed to. dint know y! more after lunch.......

 Jax i think, u dint get what i exactly meant. See its going to be from one of the articles which interests others other than the usual fun stuff.. Again i too feel that implementing is time consuming. but then when u have done enough to create a blog with much sophistication, i think doing this will take a day or so more.And i think its not going to be much difficult if u just cut the first para and paste it and provide a link to that blog. It will remain permanent till another interesting article pops up. since u visit our blog daily and has got admin rights, u can do it in minutes time since u need to fiddle with the template to post it permanently till next change. More over Recent posts gives me the list of titles which has happened in a week. But it doesnt give me the content and prompt me to read. Where as what i am talking about is like reading those few lines must prompt every one to read and in the end it should let them leave with a feel of having read something good as i felt in the end, after reading the down posted article. So that was my idea. That article on sun is again not as expected. Summa summa bhaya muruthaatha. This is also a very old news. Have u heard of elnino few years back. Its much based on such natural calamities on Earth due to celestial changes. and having a solar flare is not new to us too. Get me some thing new original and fresh! And even if i keep blogging, then thats all i too will loose my job one day. But never mind, by that time i would have got another one! Dear jax, i am not a fairy to grant all the wishes u have. But surely i will put a request to Santa to grant all ur wishes come true this christmas. By the way started anticipating christmas or u too are feeling like Vijay and manny as they felt towards Diwali....... Source of that BCP article is not known as it came as a forwarded message from srini. So i cant help u out even this time! Raama, nee engagement kathai solliye thapichittu irukka. Sari parava illai poittu vaa. and snaps 500k kulla anupina download panna vasthiya irukkum. sariya. sorry vijay that day when i was chatting with u, there was a disconnection and so couldnt proceed further. anyway All the best and happy journey ya.

 The post at "Quod scripsi, scripsi" is not a poem and it is definitely not mine. It is a song titled "Can't fight this feeling any more" by an artist named Reo Speedwagon. The title would have said it all, "The way I feel". This song and another urlLink song keep popping up in my mind so often that I start humming them unconsciously. The link to a story I sent you is again not my story. It was written by urlLink Humphrey Hawksley . The link was a special preview of the first chapter of his latest book, " urlLink The Third World War ". BTW, Sujatha is a great writer. I definitely cannot write better than him. It is true that I haven't sent any stories to you. The truth is most of the stories I have are half written. I lost interest midway or I am thinking of an ending. I'll try to put up my earlier stories online soon. So the first victim is Vicky. I can't say if I would be able to attend the wedding. But if I do and also Ramgopal turns up, I'll kick him for you. Ram why don't you put it online in your Yahoo account and send us the link (don't forget to give us permissions) like your thangachi Valli had done earlier. Thangachi irrukkure mulla alluvukku kudda annanukku illa.

 Yeah jax, U r saying right... but it seems u r chasing someone......... S Rini, its not fair from my part in the friendship focus by abstaining for your marriage that too on a holiday and paying a visit even in a working day, Any way let me wait and see what is going to happen. But, please do remember I made on time for your engagement (working day). Reg. snaps I will get u the best jpegs in a zip(around a MB) to ur office inbox.... BCP article is good.... plng. to call kicha by noon, let u know later... one more point for vijay's querry is that, we are matured enough to maintain balance (to some extent) between ordinary day and a festival day........... Yeah MDGs are really scintillating, but what efforts are taken towards the same.......... I think the time period is also very low compared (just 12 more years for 8) to the goals. coming to empty space, put something let me comment later (hahahahaha ) sorry too busy to break head...... Cheers

 I guess you are mentioning the Sideblog when you are talking about "empty space". The "Sideblog" is actually another tiny blog. To put up gists of posts is time consuming. That's why we have post titles. You can use the post titles to highlight your post, example your earlier post "Behaviour, character and personality" or the one before that "Suggestion for empty space". They really were meaningful. We can use them effectively. The only detrimental factor is that javascript is used to pull the titles from teh blog posts and put them under the Recent Posts sidebar. So if some one uses &amp; or an apostrophe, it throws up errors and also the post title does not appear in the Recent Posts sidebar. Other than that, I feel that the title serves the best purpose in highlighting the post. More on the butterfly note, read about the danger of the urlLink Sun . Also be careful, blogging can get you fired as urlLink this person recently came to grief. Ranjini, Kicha is still feeling sick. He'll be coming to Bangalore only on Sunday. BTW the mail you forwarded to me, I couldn't understand a single word of it. What is the job for and what are the requirements. There were some skill sets required that I have never before heard of. Anyway, I'll try to pass it on. Were you able to change your email options in Yahoo? You can get me anything from urlLink this list . My usual question, where did you get it from? Please mention the source whenever you put up an article. It is always useful in case I need to get background information on the article. It was quite interesting to read and quite thought provoking too. The link to Rajini's fan site is to show that art and appreciation of art is universal. But I doubt how many of us would be able to sit through a Japanese film without knowing the language. I don't seem to find a theatre where they show movies by foreign film makers (other than English). I would really love to get my hands on the following movies: urlLink O Brother, Where art thou? urlLink Akira Kurosawa 's The Seven Samurai or any of his other movies urlLink No Man's Land Anyone able to find a copy of the above movies, kindly get a copy for me.

 Its too heavy for my inbox and will block the entire traffic. u can chunk it to less than 1 mb and send us ya. be it HSS celebs or Pondy trip. And i welcome one more poet! ya Jax i read ur poem at ur jaxsays blog and found it good! By the way dint u write any stories in recent days and one more thing, the story which u had sent us some time back, i could not read fully. The story which starts at Indian PM's residence. can u resend me again? Is it a thriller? and by the way these days thrillers are not very thrilling with much twists and turns. Recently i read one sujatha's story. Hope all of us know Ganesh & Vasanth. His prime detective characters. It was a detective story and the story was so dull that in the end there was a billow of disappointment of having read a kothu kathai. Yes, the end of the story was so plain and i wonder how sujatha could write like this and it has got a place in Vikadan's Deepavali malar. That time i felt, even jax would have written better than him! So send me some interesting story which i havent read till date or the story which i have missed. Though got lots of work, my mood is kharaab and so dont feel like working only.

 Behavior, character and personality are distinct levels in the evolution of the human being. When people display nice behavior, we say they are presentable. At the next level, when they have character, they can accomplish something. At a further level, being endowed with ‘personality’, they can create something original. Let us first examine behavior . Behavior is superficial and comes through training. It is a channel through which a man expresses himself. The energies for behavior come from the vital emotions, whereas the energies for character come from the mind. The vital energies are short-lived responses to a situation. The ordinary man who is popular with everyone behaves well, has polite manners and does not criticize anyone. He is very presentable in society. But if this is where his growth has stopped, he cannot accomplish anything in the ordinary sense of the word. When a person has developed character , he can accomplish something by himself. Character is organized in the mind. It has a memory and never forgets. When the essence of the vital experience which is behavior is received in the mind and organized well so that the mind accepts that as its central direction, then it becomes character. A man with character fits into that level of society to which his character has risen. If he has a noble character or a weighty character, he may be a philanthropist or a CEO. If he has a character but his nature is small, he can organize and raise a family successfully. When the mind comes into play, it generally acts on an opinion or bases itself on an idea. It tries to understand and begins to think and organize itself. The vital does not think, it responds to the situation, but the mind listens to an idea. On the basis of this idea, the mind organizes its values. The mind gives its sanction to certain behaviors which it has accepted as right. This behavior then becomes a pattern. The essence of that pattern is based on respectability, on social values. The mental understanding is based on the idea that what is valuable must be respected. Once the mind accepts this, every behavior will be directed by that characteristic. If a mother teachers her child to be polite to his grandfather, the child does not know it should also be polite to his uncle. If the child’s mind, which is capable of understanding, receives the essence of this pattern of politeness towards elder relatives, the pattern becomes continuous and his mind accepts it as a general direction. A person with a mere behavior can follow instructions, but he cannot think on his own, whereas character comes from the mind and enables the person to carry out a task with self-direction. What is personality ? Character is necessary to achieve something in society, but when something has to be created anew, personality is needed. Where character may hesitate to attempt something completely new, personality will not. Personality can accomplish something original, whatever the field is. Personality is deeper than character. It does not confine itself to an organized expression as character does. Character needs the support of the social and psychological milieu. Because mind is a narrow organism which functions on thought, it draws its values from the general level of thought in the society. Something in the person feels safe in that climate and then the mind understands, the heart is able to be enthused about that understanding and the body is able to work. Usually when mind has to think of something original, it begins to shake. Personality cannot be centered in the mind. It does not care whether anyone else has attempted a certain work before. It has the initiative to start a fresh work in a new field. Personality does not require the extraneous support of the social sanction. After it has understood and the mind has consented, it has the imagination to give a mental emotion to that consent. Once the mind is able to visualize something in its own imagination, the heart does not hesitate to release its enthusiasm for the accomplishment of the work. The support for the work comes from the Being which is above the mind. If the mind is clear and the Being supports, it doesn’t need the support of the society. That is the difference between character and personality. Character is an efficient mental organism functioning within the social fabric of accomplished levels. Personality is an energy which comes from the Being, able to understand on its own, be enthusiastic on its own and be a trail blazer for the society. Whether the field is in literature, or scientific discovery or in industry or in founding a college, this is the basic difference between character and personality

 Jax that site on Rajini is in Japanese i believe and so its not loading properly and even if it loads also i dont think its possible to understand. Think u might have sent us to make us aware that there are websites of rajini by japanese which is a very old news to me. And that link on butterfly......... Sari kadi. Yarru adhu ippidi time waste panni ivalavu aaraaichi panraangannu theriyala. But the site on UN Millenium goals is scintillating! Hei vicky is younger to me atleast by two years manny. and so i felt too early. Hope u guys to have a good time at his marriage. Ennadhu ram is cominga? he dint come for my wedding and now he is going to go for vicky'sa? Ram this is not acceptable. ponaa othai thaan solliten. by the way ram did u contact kicha? has he come back? how is he now? he hasnt posted even a single blog till date. seems to be so sick. Hei Jax we can put in that empty space few lines of some interesting blogs. For eg. a gist or some punch lines of the discussion in our blogs. What do other guys say? coz putting a review or some good articles might demand more space where as this gist or punch lines is more short and sweet. Moreover such good articles can be posted directly on blog itself if its a forwarded one or a link can be established for such things. So lets reserve that space for something interesting . As an attempt i will post in my next blog an article which grasped me very much by its simplicity in explaining abstract things in such a clear cut manner. And jax u can use the first para of that artcile as the highligh of the article and put it in the empty space which also acts as a gist of what the article is all about! A link to the actual blog will follow at the end of this highlight ........ This is my idea jax and to implement is in ur hands. Ok others, do tell jax, what else can be put. bye for a moment to cut copy paste the article which i read in next blog

 Welcome sri, atlast u logged in...........ah!!!!!!!!! OOPS, bad login...... Jax, What they r conveying from the butterfly site, I couldnt understand anything, coz I am reading in between lines of the events, and trying to grasp something quickly, can u provide a gist in the blog. Rini, which snaps u want immdtly, diwali_hss_celebs I have zipped nearly 3 MB, other one Pondy tour yet to arrive.......... Ganja, naanum irukaen nnu soollitu poriya..............fine........ Cheers

 Dear Friends, Thankyou very much for your overwhelming welcome and wishes! Manny has pointed out has rightly that I cannot trouble Jax too much for adding 1 more id. That was a lesson for me. I am happy to announce Manny @ this moment that I had successfuly closed the id vsriprasath_chat@yahoo.com to avoid any more future problems. So no troubles, no worries! Manny! I saw Boys 3 times due to technical features involved in that film. I admire Shankar's ideas, thoughts and his love towards film career. Shankar struggled in the tamil film industry for 11 years, Vickram 14 years, A.R.Rahman 7 years to get a break through! Don't think I am advocating these people. These are generic lessons we should learn. The best way to reach people is media, films, TV ads. Ok no boring again! You may face tougher time with ur Superiors/Boss. I have Translation Software for you people. Suppose your Superior/Boss says "I totally agree with you" means " I totally disagree with you" "You are Right! But... " means "Even if you agree! I don't care" "I didn't have time to go through your mail and I can't understand what u said" means "I don't know to access the e-mail software" "We have an opportunity" means "You have a problem" "Convince your client for this deal" means "Hell with your Client" Ok guys and gals! Meet u again! Sri Prasath Venkateswaran

 We all wud have heard about "God Fathers"... but now I hereby add crown to Jax by giving him the title "Blog Father". Namakku ivlo goals irukkunnu ivlo naal enakku theriyave theriyathu my dear blog father....nenjai thottuteenga ponga... che...intha blog'la emoticons ellam illa...illatti namma expressions innum nalla sollalaam...enna naan solrathu??? Ok dears, i will be on leave and will get back to work on monday only. Till then bye and I request our Blog Father (Jax) to take care of our blog and bloggers...ha ha. Mahen

 Welcome to the blog, Sri . Good to hear from Ganesh after a long time. Meanwhile, if you are a Rajini fan, this is a urlLink must visit . As Manny had said, we at time get to discuss about things like urlLink goals , whenever we are not discussing about Bisibhelebhath or Rava Kesari.

 And Sri enna ithu Technological Challenge is frightening, threatening'nnu ....athu ithunnu ethetho solra...!!! Hope he shud have a wrong notion or in other words a high hyped thoughts about our blog activities... I mean somebody wud have told him that techy discussion is encouraged (of course it is) in our blog... But Sri, dont get fooled... we will most often discuss about how to prepare Sambar saatham (Bisibelabaath in new terms!!!) ha ha... so come out with some recipes too.

 hi all, nice to read the deepavali expereinces of some. then annan Pachai Pachai Sri welcome to the blog. bye

 Vanthuttanya...vanthuttann....!!!!! welcome Sriprasath...but one thing da...here in blog we cannot keep on adding more Ids of yours as you r used to with the messenger...(!!!!) so keep this in mind sri... poor jax will have to send separate invitations if you want multiple Ids (of yours) to be added...ha ha... Apram Boys padam paathu sri romba affect aayirukkannu ninaikiren...RAC...Ticket...Train'nnu solli irukkan...(FYI dear bloggers: Diwali annaikku veetukku call panni Boys padam Paathiya da'nnu kettan enkitta...ha ha...avan moonu murai paathanam...enakku pidikkala da'nnu sonnen...but avanukku romba pidichirunthatham...ha ha...so probably...antha "friendship enbathu RAC...." song thaan avana romba affect panni irukkumnnu ninaikiren). BTW...myself, vijay and Ram has planned for vickky's marriage...Vijay is going to mumbai this friday and since he will be in his initial days of induction into PCS, he said that he was not sure abt the plan. But he said that he will make it up to be there on 12th. And, ranjini..how can u say that this is too early for him yaar...when u, valli, sindhu, and vinitha were able to marry, then y not vickky??? this is really not fair on your part ma... Mahen

 Hi, Greetings to ALL! Since a long time I was quarelling with Xavi, to reserve a berth in this group. I though it will be RAC, but finally I got a berth for travelling in this train. I thank all who responded to my mail. Technological Challenge, it is the phrase which frightens u and me day to day. I read an article in which how top tech companies invent technology and how people experiment the same! Here are some samples. Compaq is considering changing the command "Press Any Key" to "Press Return Key" because of the flood calls asking where the "Any" key is. A Dell technician advised a customer to put his troubled floppy back in the drive and close the door. The customer asked the tech to hold on, and was heard putting the phone down, getting up and crossing the room to close the door to his room A customer was asked to send a copy of his defective diskettes. A few days later, a letter arrived from the customer along with the photocopies of the floppies. Hope u enjoyed! till then! Bye! Sri Prasath Venkateswaran

 Really.......????? Its too early for him and i think even the month of April is far away to fool us. Pooor girl! by the way, it seems many of us had a grand diwali except few like vijay, manny.... Ofcourse i did have a great time with dresses pouring from all sides along with wishes. Ya Diwali collection was around 2500rs/- Need to plan to spend it properly. Since i have got a bit of work, i couldnt blog and will keep in touch later. jax thanx for helping me change my mail delivery options for the group. Ram post the snaps soon and can send us soon. till then bye

 Hi all, as I said earlier, Vignesh prabhu is getting married with his cousin (athai ponnu) on 12th Nov. he will invite all thru our msitmmb soon. This is an expected but immediate arrangement it seems. and the interesting thing is that both vickky and his brother is getting married on the same day and that too his brother's bride is none other than the sister of vickky's bride... really interesting... hope to c all boys soon in V'nagar

 Shocking news!! Everyone likes butterflies. But you should know that they are very dangerous. Read urlLink on for more information . BTW, Kicha is still sick. He had called this morning. He'll be back on Monday. I have added Sriprasath to the blog. If you have some time, read urlLink Quod scripsi, scripsi and leave you comments there, not here.

 s manny, I forgot that... He called me but I was not at home... I think he might have called me to convey the same... anyway hoping to catch him online... But Nov. 12th its quite difficult for me to get leave, as just now I had 2 days leave. le'me try...

 Hi all, One (probably a shocking but true)news... our vignesh prabhu is getting married on 12th of november 2003. Ijust got this message from him...this might be an unexpected news to many of u. but some of the boys may not feel so and I expected this to happen ... got to go and i will post the details soon in the evening Mahen

 BTW...Vijay has said that he has lost something....which he had in his school days... Yes machaan...for me too... i too have the same kind of feeling that u have as if we lost something... May be we wud hav lost our good friends (!!!!!) and unfortunately we ended up getting into all new contacts in our UG and more precisely in our PG...(diyounnnnnn!!!!!!!!!*!*!!**!*!*!) The kind of bad and bitter PG life...(ha ha ha...) may be the reason which wud have made you feel so. ok da past is past...hereafter dont spare any efforts to make your life full of joy and surrounded by good ppl.(Like me). Mahen

 hai all, fine and had nice time after a short gap at native. Sriprasath called me up and conveyed his wishes, from him only I came to know about kicha's ill health... but I thought he would have reached blr by this time... Jax, any idea when kicha will be back.. howz he feeling now... Jax, do add sriprasath to our blog members.. and let him / me know once its done... Actually, Oct 18 - 19 I was slightly not feeling well.. something iritated me.. might be diwali fever... by Oct 20, really I got Fever, I tried 6 Paraceatamol.. and half filled stomach...gud, it saved nine.... I have booked tickets to (oct 22 -> ngl) and fro (oct 27 -> blr), but a shocking news, That I have to stay and go next day... coz of some delivery etc... somehow I convinced the PM (project manager) and made alternatives for my position... had a nice trip in Volvo (Imported from Japan) really a fantastic trip in A/C bus with 150 Rs/- more from actual fare.. just 12 hrs journey (798 Km in Indian Roads).. really enjoyed well with Boyz film (I slept coz I have already watched). Yeah, coz of the tension on the day of my journey at office, I couldnt find time to read blogs too. we had floor decoration for Diwali, our Floor stood second.. will post snaps soon... Our chidambaram tour snaps are ready & is in courier section.. will post them as soon as it reach me... Congrats vijay for ur step towards a new challenging envt (Career, Climate, Culture, Food & Language: Mumbai PCS). Coming to ur question, I have the answer, but I am not sure to what extent the same will convince you... Gud man, u purchased a week b4, I purchased a day b4 that too only a shirt for formality... Yeah I watched most of the debate, "Just we have come to know that these are yet another day which acts as a family get together, but in childhood these days are time to relish away from study, no pressure from teachers / parents the whole day, moreover new dresses only during festivals / functions... but now.. we can get dress rt. now also if needed.. those days need is not the criteria but function is the criteria, nowdays viceversa" Kavi, since strugling with gr8 responsibility and placing little effort I couldnt find time to post, although I read often.. moreover there is no matter to be posted. Manny yet to read your links.. will come to both discussion (Marriage & Religion later).... enna da.. pillion seat free ah??? irukooo??? hmmm irukatuumm... Valli, Sindhu, how about ur diwali celebs... Rini, how was urs... During my stay at native, talked to Ganesh, Rajesh, Rohini, Sindhu, JK, Shoba... all conveyed their wishes to all... Cheers

 Hi All, Hope everyone enjoyed this hols..What happened to kicha? Not feeling well. Today morning just I was wondering why there is no Good Morning mail from kicha. I came to chennai sunday afternoon itself..'coz I forgot to book the return ticket and in last moment I didn't get any tickets in bus or train.So I preferred Day journey. It was too boring on sunday evening..I was alone in home. Then just started with all the housekeeping work pending. My roomi came in the evening..Then we went out for shopping..had dinner outside. Valli..How is your job going? I didn't see any blogs about your experience..I might have missed that also..I am not sure. Expecting all your blogs soon...

 hi all, hope everyone enjoyed deepavali very much. thalai deepavali, rendam deepavali, irupathi munam deepavali, irupathi nazham deepavli, irupathi anjam deepavali,... yellam eppadi irunthathu. regarding myself, i enjoyed a lot. but comparing to deepavalies which came during my school/college days, i havnt enjoyed that much. y it so? i asked myself. during that days i start counting days for deepavali well before 2 months. like the world cup starting day counting in ESPN/Star, i used to start counting like 70 days to go, 55 days to go, next month this day it is deepavali, only two weeks to go,.... like that i used to start purchase dresses one month before the deepavali. usually in our town all the dress shops start deepavali sales exactly one month before the deepavali. only that time they start advertising. but in my house we buy dresses before that. but for this deepavali i only bought dresses 2 weeks before, and also i bought it in 2 days. why it so? i lost something? i m searching reasons for that? if anyone hav similar sort of feeling then pls tell me if u find reasons. i ll blog once i found the reasons. btw, has anyone watched patti mandram in Sun TV on deepavali day? it is related to what i said above. i ll blog all these things soon.

 Hope everyone had a wonderful diwali! Kicha spoke to me today morning, He is still sick. so he'll be on leave for a week. He said he'll try to blog if possible.

 Hi all, Diwali Wishes from Ganesh & Valli. Wish you all a happy & safe Diwali.

 Wish you all a very Happy Diwali... I'll be going home tonite... heard the weather is not so good in many parts of Tamil Nadu... nothing different in Bangalore too... last 2 days I was down with high fever and diarrhoea... and feeling better today... its an erratic weather here... y'day morning it was raining heaviliy... then there was 3 hrs of bright sunlight in the afternoon with virtually no clouds on the sky.. and in the evening it started raining again... at the moment, the clouds and the sun are playing hide-and-seek...

 Hi All, Wish you all a very happy Diwali!! I am going home tomm evening. Hope Rini is going home today. What about sindu and valli....U are going to take off on Friday or what? Ram no blogs from you? When you are going home?? Have Nice Time!! Bye

 This year Diwali seems to be quieter than usual. Maybe the ban on the decibel level ratios is responsible or have people woken up to the fact that their hard earned money is going up in smoke. Those who didn't read today's newspaper. Surely, urlLink here is a good reason to get married soon guys. Read a description of avial and sambar, as described in the New York Times. One of her classics is avial, a ragout of vegetables, in which she uses matchstick-size pieces of carrot, cucumber, green beans, drumstick (long, ridged pods from the moringa oleifera tree, rich in vitamin C, with a delicate flavor resembling that of asparagus), kovakka or little melon (a kind of gherkin) and brinjal, a longish eggplant. First she boils the vegetables with green chilies. Then she adds a mixture with the texture of oatmeal, including turmeric, coconut, garlic and cumin, along with home-made cow's-milk curd and kari leaves (highly aromatic and widely used in Kerala, these are often confusingly called curry leaves in the West; they look like basil leaves and taste of citrus and bell peppers). Sambar, a lentil and vegetable stew, makes use of two unusual spices. Asafetida, a resin taken from the rhizomes of giant fennel, is admired in Kerala for its earthy scent when fried in oil, and fenugreek seeds are liked for their bitter caramel flavor. Together with tamarind, a souring agent, chilies and coriander leaves, they give the stew intricate layers of flavor. Interesting to read the different names that the foreigners give to Indian dishes, trying to findsimilarities between thier food and ours. Try figuring out what sourdough crepes are? Anyway, Have a wonderful Diwali, guys and gals, at home or not?

 Interesting to read the essays that Manny had posted. here are my views: Mankind has always been fascinated by religion. As someone said, it is the opium of the mind . A short look at the number of urlLink religions in the world will baffle the mind. So many religions, so many views... Add to this mixture, a large heapful of urlLink mythologies , you get a totally confusing volatile potion. But after understanding many mythologies, it is possible to point out several similarities between the mythologies, be it a greek, egyptian or matabele. So all I can understand is that there has been a common origin for the beliefs. The question is where? Africa (as scientists say), Ancient Persia (according to Judeo, Christian, Islamic and Hindu myths), Mediterranean (Greek, Egyptian, Atlantis). That's one question for which no one has been able to give a correct answer. But as George Bernard Shaw said, " There is only one religion, though there are a hundred versions of it. "

 Hi hi hi... Quite for a short while I have not blogged anything... Not because that i should not....just lack of more free hours to rest myself and share things with u all. But am used to read all ur blogs... Then happy to know that vijay has got into PCS. But at the same time I lost my sleep for the past few months...the reason being many in number but very specific about one thing...nothing but all chennai guys getting placed in good cos. First Ganesh into CPL Ajayan got into Eveready... Then Rajesh into Godrej... then Vijay into PCS... ipdiya pona enna aagumo therila...haha as a result I was not able to bear these shocking news one after the other in a very short while of abt 2 to 3 months...(Just kidding) (Just kidding'nnu bracketla pottathu summa oru formalitykkaga naama solvom illa...athukkaga...but really i lost my sleep over this matter...ha ha) Anyhow...Congrats boys...have a nice time ahead in ur new jobs ...(dei...ithu vayitherichaloda solra all the best da. unmainnu nambidateenga...) and my life is going cool...and hey one thing I forgot to tell to u all..

 Hi mates, An interesting article on the new restrictions laid over the H1B visas for foreign pros. US is no more a country which will dictate terms to others especially for countries like India and China...and the "son of the soil" story no longer helps them... urlLink Read more... Regards, Mahen

 Hi all, If you go to to the bottom of the sidebar in the blog, you might find a new title called "sideblog". Tell me what we can use it for. Will post my replies to the two topics soon, Bye.

 Dear mates, My wishes for a happy diwali... On the eve of this festival, I came across an article abt Hinduism... Worth knowing the whats of our great religion and makes me feel something good about my identity... if u have time have a look at this urlLink link Also, a bit of news that i found was as follows... "Some liberal religious historians have raised the possibility that stories of Jesus' birth, ministry, execution, and resurrection were copied, at least in part, from Krishna's life." To see what they say in its entirety abt this issue have a look at this urlLink link Ur views are welcome... Regards, Mahen

 The flight to India The jobs Britain stole from the Asian subcontinent 200 years ago are now being returned. by George Monbiot Britain's industrialisation was secured by destroying the manufacturing capacity of India. In 1699, the British government banned the import of woollen cloth from Ireland, and in 1700 the import of cotton cloth (or calico) from India. Both products were forbidden because they were superior to our own. Now the jobs we stole 200 years ago are returning to India. Read urlLink full-story

 Its history in the making..!!! Kavitha posting her blog all by herself...!!! Anyway.. nice to know that u r able to get some time to browse and post... I'll be starting home on thursday night for diwali... and at work.. am doing some programming with.. guess what... COBOL and CICS... Yep..!! some mainframe stuff... no... not moved from my good old .NET ... but this is an initiative to integrate mainframes with microsoft technologies.. and I'm starting with the mainframe part of it and have to look at ways of integrating it with .NET so that we could get a real-time processing (rather than batch processing) with mainframe in the picture.. And yet to see views about that topic... I too am thinking on it...

 Hi, Congrats Vijay Babu....iyyo pavam Mumbai! Xavier...I'll try my level best to make it...but cannot assure you....cos next weekend is Diwali...anyway can you tell me the exact place of the ITMA fair in Birmingham. Rini, as Valli said i dont have the same enthu as it would have been in India... My Mother-in-law sent me a silk saree and Boomi on his behalf got me a couple of trousers and jumpers...planning to take off friday afternoon to prepare some sweets ....have a party - not the sort that i would love to go....There is a huge Indian community in Leicester and they have fireworks...planning to go and watch it. Boomi's friends are coming down to our home for Diwali...so hoping to have nice time... I never imagined that Bulb will be such a big kozhi, at the same time prooving that she is a Diana as well! Kicha, we are not certain of how long we'll have to stay...as u said one yr is over...and our visa is getting expired by jan 2004....probably v'll get it extended for another 6 months or so... gud topic for discussion...will pour in my thoughts later!

 It's Nice to get to know from vijay that He got an offer in PCS. Congrats!! For Diwali..This weekend I went for shopping. I got a saree for Amma and a shirt for Anna. I got a plesant surprise from my brother for this diwali ...he got 4 chudi's for me. Yet to see all that. This time I am eagerly waiting to go home.

 Remember my urlLink link in urlLink earlier post on a house designed with CSS. I got a mail from the site's designer. I am reproducing it below. Thanks for linking to my demo! Not sure what you mean by "Please don't view it in Internet Explorer." though. Works perfectly in IE5/Mac and IE6/Win. -- Chris Hester http://www.designdetector.com Good to here that Vijay has entered PCS. Congrats, da.

 hi, i pleased to inform u that the poor Patni Computer Systems did a blunder by offered me a job in one of their Mumbai office. so i m going to join there next month. i ll update u shortly with more details regarding it.

 Kicha, an interesting topic for discussion. I'm eager to know what the others would like to say about these, especially our married ones. I'll post my comments later. But before that, everyone take a look at urlLink this and tell me your comments. Please don't view it in Internet Explorer ver 5.x . View it in IE 6 or Netscape 7 or Mozilla or FireBird.

 jax, feel free to use anything... and about the chat in blog... how personal is a "personal" chat... am sure there was nothing "personal" in that chat, that I have "revealed" to the world... its more a sharing of "something funny" that went on between two people... I intend to propose a topic for discussion... this was going on since morning in our BB.. so just felt like knowing what all of us have in mind too... This is was the post in our BB which started it all... Here goes... Drop in your views if u find the topic interesting... Hey dear guys and gals ….. This is not a silly question. It’s very tough to answer. Easy it may seem, but given a second thought it could raise a big debate. What according to you is the right age to marry? Is it in the early twenties, when you are full of the so called “josh” or should it be in the late twenties, when u have gained experience of how to handle life. Whatever you may feel right, may feel absolutely wrong for another. Doesn’t matter though, coz it’s always free to express your opinions. Now the importance of the topic – Why should it be a concerned issue? If you must have read last Sunday’s supplements of Times Of India, you will agree that yeah… people do choose career prior to family. And when their career is all glory, they turn to family. But then its too late. Either there aren’t too many books on the shelf, or you may havta pick what you get, not what you want. On the other hand, we also see cases where kiddos fall in love and marry right after college. They don’t realize the responsibilities and duties involved in a married life, and often end up in disasters. Many a time, the not so forward Indian parents come in between, and they set a deadline, which could be as late as 30 or could be as early as 20. Now again, the average Indian youth, doesn’t have the guts or doesn’t feel it proper to stand up for their choices especially, when they are against the parents. Some may call this discipline, some may call it orthodox, some may call it obedience, some may call it fear. Tis not easy to bring a trend among a social culture. And very often, the beginners of the trend are often branded as the maggot in the apple. Open your views, and let’s see what the Bulletin Board has in mind. Keep the ball rolling

 Bon Jour, Kicha, that was really an interesting chat transcript. Since when have you taken over Rajesh as a chief Kozhi catcher, Kicha? But is it ethical? is a question that I would want to ask everyone. I know there was no illwill meant. But what if two persons are having a personal chat and one of them puts the chat transcript online? Just my thoughts... Kicha, my comments on what you sent: Wonderful . Can I use a part of it (especially the 2nd and last paras) in any of my stories. I'll give the proper credits for it. Can I? Those who didn't know what I am saying. You'll know soon. It has been a long time since we had a long discussion on the blog. Anyone giving out topics, please let us avoid rehashing old topics once more. Let us discuss some new things this time. As for movie reviews, I watched " urlLink LOTR-TTW " on urlLink DVD a couple of days back. It is amazing to see how a movie becomes more interesting when you watch it on a DVD. I was unlucky to miss it on the silver screen. Waiting for the next installment to be released in December. As for books, I am currently reading " urlLink The Sons of Fortune " by Jeffrey Archer. Those who have read Archer before might understand this story would contain, the twists and turns etc. which reminds me. Hey Sindhu, where are my books. Does Vinod have them? If you have not yet read any of Archer's books, start with " urlLink Not a penny more, not a penny less ". You'll love it. I am still trying to get my hands on " urlLink The Avenger " by Fredrick Forysth. The librarian has asked me to collect it tomorrow. So I have to complete reading "The Sons of Fortune" by tonight. Other than that, I'm waiting for my project to be completed by today.

 Valli, I've seen "Bend it like Beckham" 4 times, and "Mr. and Mrs. Iyer" twice... Konkana Sen, who played the lead role also won the National Award for "Best Actress". After so much... America is just waking up to these movies... the country is becoming as dumb as its president... why don't u people kick out that dumbo... Sindhu, how long still to go in ur stay in UK... Its been almost a year, ain't it... any plans of returning home... Rajesh seems to be travelling a lot.. no posts for quite some time from him... and Manny too...

 Hey Kicha, had a nice time laughing......So finally did she understand that you were playing the fool around, or is she still expecting ur arrival on 22nd???? Happened to watch two wonderful movies last week......one was "Mrs & Mr Iyer".......An Indian movie.....The hero's nativity is said as Bengal, & the heroin's is from TamilNadu....So they communicate in English, with tit bits of tamil & hindi inbetween.....& for our convinience, we get close captions when the dialouge is in Hindi or Tamil.....The whole movie is about a journey, from the deep south to Calcutta.......It was simply wonderful..... The other movie was "Bend it like Beckham"......an Indian(Punjabi) family in London tries to raise their soccer-playing daughter in a traditional way.......Her dream is to play soccer professionally like her hero David Beckham.......Does her parents allow her to chase her dream or ties her with family values and stuffs??....This is the whole stroy about...The director is Gurinder Chadha(who's given one another hit..."Bhaji on the beach")...This movie was a sleeper hit in England.....a late pick up....but recieved an overwhelming response.....Now, picking up speed in America too......Don't ever miss a chance to watch these wonderful movies...... Kicha, so at what time u'll be at my home?....this week end we are celebrating Diwali, right????........

 urlLink CSS Tutorial - Interesting articles on using CSS to practical usage. The blog has utilized a few concepts from this site for the navigation bar at the top. urlLink W3Schools CSS Tutorial - A simple intro on using CSS. http://www.csszengarden - A wonderful site showcasing the capablities of CSS. The html page is the same but the CSS syles are different. My favorite designs are urlLink Mnemonic and urlLink I dream in colour By the way, urlLink Firebird 0.7 is out. If you want to get the best of CSS, you better download and install Firebird.

 Dear Rini. I didn't get what you want properly. You want an article on CSS, right? I'll let you know after some time. I was on leave yesterday. And guess what my boss is off to Dubai for a week.

 Hey Rini, I'm feeling so sick Rini...I wanna get chudi or saree for me too......But, poor me, I've just got a pair of Van Huesen Trousers and shirts. However i still have one unused silk saree....new in box....Persian blue (If I'm right)....... We have two functions here, conducted by the Indian community......we'll be going there.....we have planned to go to a temple, with our friends.....we don't have a temple, in Lexington......need to travel to a nearby place....one and a half hr travel....90 miles.....We have also planned to make some sweets, one dish per family(Kinda Potleg)......will sure be speaking with our parents & bro's..... But inspite of all these, I feel, i'm missing something terribly.....the festive mood, the sound of crackers, flooded readymade showrooms, busy bakeries, my quest for chudis 'n sarees.....everything...... But this is far far more better than last year's Diwali......It was a friday......Ganesh went to office asusual......I hardly knew one family here....who were also far away from our place.....I was not that confident about my cooking experinces....So I did'nt try out anything new or different......I was afraid of deep frying also at that time(I had this problem for a long time....I've witnessed two deep frying accidents....one to my mom & the other one, to one of my aunts.Though now I'm very comfortable)......I was crying the whole day, so depressed.....nobody around me....Finally, i was okay in the evening, when i got dressed up, in my new silk saree & Ganesh took me to that one place whom we knew..... This year, Bless me, we have so many friends around us.....we have plans to celebrate it together.....Hope we'll have a great time together......

 Yes, this weekend, Srini surprised me by getting a sari for Diwali. He had already got me two chudi and now one more sari. Its in Maroon color with embrodery in the palloo section and with small buttas. Good it looks on me. What guys how about u people? Esp. Valli &Sindhu, ennadi panna poreenga?

Y not much of blogging these days? ok guys, nothing more interesting. Will share if something crops up. Till then bye

 Dear Kicha, Good to have you back. I've been troubled by a project for the past two weeks. Not much work for me literally. All I have to do is co-ordinate the proceed and it driving me nuts. I hope I can get the project completed by the next two days. BTW, Sindhu, if you could visit Birmingham again sometime between the 22 nd and 29 th of this month, visit the ITMA fair. There if you can locate the pavilion of Lakshmi Card Clothing there, spend some time to take a look at a video presentation going on at their stall and then tell me how it was. Was my work for the past two weeks worth it? Can you tell me? Planning to work again? Somehow, I managed to install Windows XP, Windows Me, and Windows Server 2003 (in that order) on my machine. My Visual Studio .NET installation went fine, except that I need to activate my software through the net and I don't have a net connection at home. I'm still wondering what to do. Damn Microsoft and their stupid activation scheme. I realize I have to find a way to crack that stupid activation hurdle. Anybody willing to render their services?

 Hi, My system is fine now... and am online in Yahoo messenger and MSN (this is for Kavi alone)... the exciting world of internet is open to me...

 Hi, System still off the network. The support people here are too slow. I've escalated the request. Hope something will be done atleast today... couldn't do much y'day because of this...

 Hi... Have a look into urlLink Procra Also urlLink Pareto ... All the very best.

 Hi, Hope everyone had a gud wkend.... Great to hear from Kavi after a long time.....yes kavi as u said it's very difficult to manage ur worklife and family in one-go.....but a lot depends on ur life partner! Xavier...i read the piece of story in the link.... it was well-written, narrative and simple in language.... Most importantly I was able to visualise things....it has a great take-off....but the momentum can be fine-tuned a bit...a few sentences can be rephrased....like... "The soldiers seperated...." other than these it was really great to read....kept me intact until the end... this weekend we went to Birmingham along with one of Boomi's friend....a new shopping complex was opened recently called 'Bull Ring'....had the usual set of shops that we find all over UK.....everything under a single roof.....it was so much crowdy like T.Nagar Ranganathan street....but the interesting part was a shop called ' selfridges'...it has everything and anything u need for a house...clothes, books, music Cd's, bags, cosmetics, decorative items, electronic goods,entertainment and what not....it even had a restaurant....English, Chineses, Itlalian.......just amazing but a bit messy as well! Watched ' Bad Boys II ' in a nearby cinema complex...horrible movie...it was dragging on, on and on.... oops...i forgot to tell one more thing.....I have resigned my job....right now i'm under notice period...so will work until the end of this month!....looking forward to staying at home for some time before my next assignment!...Boomi is just waiting for the d-day.....so that nan oru nalavadu Boomi ya torture pannama thaniya samaikarthukku.....

 Hi, I'm released from that stupid project. From today am at my good old place. But still, yet to get back to full form. My system is still giving problems connecting to the network. Once it gets sorted out, I'll be back to full form...

 Hi all, Matthew Hayden has just broken Brian Lara's record (375) of being the highest test scorer. Looks like the Zimbabeweans are being massacred by the Aussies. Meanwhile, read the origin of C urlLink TRL + ALT + DEL . Bye for now.

 My terminal is still not working... and I'm still to be released from the project, so not able to spend time with the support people to get my system going... Y'day, I had one of the most frustrating days at work.. got bugged up with the project's PL... just felt for a few moments like bursting out at him... restrained myself... just praying that I get the hell out of this project soon... hopefully, I might get released by the end of next week.. but nothing has been confirmed yet.. hoping for the best...

 Hi, Read urlLink this and tell me your thoughts on it. Bye.

 Thanx for the wishes, guys. Xavier, i enjoyed the alternate lines in your poem.....first, third etc....The best of all, was the last couple of lines......." You've got good friends, And we're ALL getting older "....inba then vandhu paayudhu kaadhinilae....... B'day went, as normal as any other day...with tit bits of celebs, then 'n there.....like, getting phone calls from parents & brothers, to bless me......Ganesh surprising me with a very very big mickey mouse (if i make it stand, it's 3/4th of me) I loved it so much (by the way, collecting plush toys is my hobby)....getting so many e-cards from all our friends.....other than these, the day was the same.....infact, more crucial....morning, at work, one silly stupid bug, was irritating me for more than an hr....& i had'nt prepared for my test for the afternoon class.....I was "Mulichifying" like our class boys do, whenever we used to have test there at DES.....thank god it was cancelled..... Kicha, did'nt you celebrate, your anniversery with Infy???......We need a treat man....... Kavi, great to see your post....I'm working in VB.Net and Ms Access. abt the cookery doubts.....ofcourse to me, Sindhu & Rini......unakku koluppu di......

 You can insert a single quote using the escape sequences. See the list urlLink here. Yes, you can change your posts after it has been published. There is an link called "edit" next to the post details in Blogger. You can click on it to load the post and then edit it as you like. Your admin rights allow you to change the posts of others if you want to. BTW the past week, I am receiving a CD everyday. It started with a urlLink Windows 2003 Server evaluation copy. A few days later, a copy of MS urlLink Speech Server SDK and a DVD of urlLink Visual Studio.net 2003 . Yesterday, a copy of urlLink Sun's latest desktop , codename "Mad Hatter", arrived. And today, a copy of urlLink Bullfighter , a software application. The coming week is surely going to be very busy with these things. I have also updated " urlLink Quod scripsi, scripsi " after a month's gap. If you wish, you can leave your comments on that blog.

 Jax, how to insert a quote? i forgot how to use a quote, i mean single quote. and onew more doubt, once my blog is published and its in archive section, can i still change some of my posts? Can i do changes to posts by others? i am asking this coz i remember u telling that still i have got admin rights.

 Hi,How are you All..the members the blog family? I was a little bit busy so I coudn't blog, Really I am feeling like living in island. No contact with anyone for atleast 1 or 2 months. Few calls from friends now and then keep me updated about you all. Then yesterday I spoke to vijay and he sent me all the blogs and archives...From 8.40AM I am enjoying reading all your blogs. When I saw sam's mail in yahoogroups..Really I shocked to get to know that kannan sir is no longer with us. It's really so sad..Then hope valli and sindhu are very busy with their work.Hey.. you know I took a flat near Besant Nagar with my friends(I don't remember whether I already updated you about this) and moved there last week. We started cooking. our Dishes are good compared to our hostel food....But yet to buy books to learn varieties. I hope valli ,rini and sindhu(Should I say in this order ganesh,srini and boomi) can help me to learn cooking. We 3 are staying together...Really I am enjoying being in home after 9 years of my hostel life. Valli..How is your work going? Which platform you are working now..? Gals......I really would like to know how you are balancing between your personal life and work. I had my product delivery on last week. Till last week..work is too tight for me. oct 2nd and all..I left the office at night 4.30AM(I should say 3rd morning). I couldn't find time to sleep all these last 3 to 4 weeks. Just I was thinking about rini,sindhu and valli. But in my case 'coz of some problems we went for redesign of the product and the time duration was too short..so it was like that. But really I would like to discuss '"Working women (that too married and got childrens) have time to live their life?". Ram, Bala told that you planned to go to cbe also..So I called bala on saturday to talk toy ou all. But he said..no they haven't come. seems all had a Great Break!!Jax...I like the present blog color which you are using for the page and title. Time is 10AM..I am going to start my work. 1.30 hrs passed by reading and typing blog and attending conf call. Have a Great Day!! Cheers....... Kavitha.N

 Many more happy returns of the day valli! How was ur celebration? Mail us all with a big story as it follows. Really great time i had u know. All his friends are nothing but a cloud of humour, care, smile, laughter, fun, friendliness, love, concern wrapped together to show me the rainbow of life! Oh my! how i envied and also enjoyed being with them. Appaaaaaa, naan theriyaama savaal vituten, that i will cook for those guys when i am at chennai and they dint leave me till i cooked for all of them though i said -n- no. of saaljaapu. Atlast, they made me cook Veg. biryani & Curdrice. Paavam, those guys u know, they had to eat the Biryani which was almost like pongal. Ya i had kept more water and so adhu kolanji pochu. but then taste wise it was good it seems. Curd rice was really superb. In the end, with the threat that i will cook for the next time, every body submitted their results that my cooking was good! Thats Ranjini!! The thing is i cooked for 12 of them at a time. I could not believe that i cooked for so many at a time that too all alone. Ofcourse everybody helped me by cutting vegetables, cleaning rice, opening the grocery packs, cleaning utensils, operating mixie. Ore kalebaram thaan. Kadavule, Water mattum naan correct proportionla vachirundha, today i would have come out with good name & fame ! No probs, i will try sometime later too. Really it has now given me a confidence that i can cook for -n- no. of people with out any fuss. woweeeeeeeeeee i can manage situations like this in future tooooooooooo. Hmmmmmmm regarding our visits, we had a great time at Mayajaal, hope u know its a multiplexer and has got bowling alley. U know what, i did bowling for the first time. And the most funny part was, i was the only one who dint know bowling and literally every buddy of his taught me how to bowl. Ya, they were almost praying for me to hit atleast one pin when i was enjoying a full pack strike by them. Good they play u know, including srini. Everytime i bowl, it goes in the side lane and one time u know what happened, as i was swinging the ball front and back, before i could release, it slipped from my fingers and rolled back and almost hit srini. Poor he! then what, every body were flying away from the place, if i was bowling. It was really fun to see a guy hiding behind his friends as i had told that my next target was to hit him. Ah, atlast, i too could shake some 8 pins in one stroke. Oh, how good they were u know, trying hard to make me hit atlest once. Obviously, had i enjoyed something @ mayajaal then it was due to their friendly move to make me not feel despaired as i couldnt hit and was struggling to hit. With such an exhibit of concern and fun we left from Mayajaal to Muttukaad to enjoy a classic evening while surfing the backwaters in a rowboat. The whole water was almost bathing in moonlight when we reached muttukaad. Really speaking i was the only one who desparately wanted to go to Muttukad and so coz of me, all the other 12 came with us. Ofcourse worth was our visit, though it was getting dark. Everybody were happy with a new kind of boating experience. U know i struggled hard to row and all others in the boat panicked with the fear that i might drop the oar any time in water. But then they took even this risk for their new guest(its me)! Then atlast that day i left them free as i was feeling tired and said will go back home. The next day we started towards Besant nagar beach. The climate was so cool even at 9 o clock and oh my! the beach was clean u know. Not much of Garbage. Good it was to trod on those golden sand and get wet in white waters. All his friends played volleyball and i had a nice time watching them play. Ofcourse we both had a pleasant short walk along the waters to make our morning come live! In the evening we went for shopping to a Casual wear shop and came out with baggages of shirts and pant for srini. Poor me, i dint buy any as i dint get any of my size and dint like too. The next day was the day of testing! Yes i tested almost all the members out there with my cooking extravaganza. When everybody were tired we slipped to one of his close friends house to be given a warm welcome to their place. As hari happens to be one of srini's best friend they had a nice time plunging themselves in nostalgia about the heydays they had spent together and also they were discussing on how to bring those days back now! Good move! With a warm heart we all started our move towards Spencer plaza as i hadnt seen even once. My god, its big man. Hmmmmmmmmmm bigger than all shopping malls in Bangalore. Very spacious were every shops and fully A/ced. Good shopping experience for me. I had a good time, getting into Landmark, one of the biggest book store i believe. We bought a Casette on Madukya Upanishad by Pandit Jasraj. Its a classic! We searched for it in Bangalore, but dint find any and finally caught it at Chennai. Then we stepped into every garment shop there like Provogue, Blackberys, CP and bought one shirt for Srini at Provogue for Diwali. I liked it. His friends toh, appaaaa, teasing him like anything, coz when ever he enters into trial room, they will ask if i like it or not and when he comes out, he straightly searches for me amidst them and asks my opinion first and then goes to his friends while i was feeling shy to tell my comments infront of them and blushing a bit. Ofcourse, before trying he gets suggestion of Hari, who has got a taste similar to Srini and is more particular in getting the best for srini than me. Nice to see such friends ya! Finished our shopping spree with a chocolate icecream and mini samosas. Went home and started packing for our trip to Pondichery. Arey, u should see that East Coast Road from Chn to Pnd, my god, just beautiful and to value add it, the climate became so soothing and cool. So good was the weather and our travel that we never felt the distance covered. We had a graceful darshan of Mother and Sri Auribindo and got their blessings from their Samadhi. From there we went to the Auroville a city in the making, where people from almost 30 nations are trying to realise the ideals of Mother and Sri Aurobindo. Its fully covered by nature, beautiful was the surrounding and they insist on silence which is really worth in such a divine atmosphere. Oh, it was really surprising to see that almost every soul was dipped in silence when we reached the MAtri Mandir, which is the soul of the city! With blessings and grace, we left the city and started towards bangalore with a comfort feeling of having spent our days merrily and peacefully.

 Should Microsoft Be Liable for Bugs in Its Products? Should Microsoft be held financially liable for the vulnerabilities in Windows and its other products? Granted, this year hasn't been good, security-wise, for Microsoft: This summer's SoBig.F virus and MSBlaster worm interrupted businesses and individuals worldwide, albeit without any loss of data, and recent vulnerabilities in Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) facilitated the deadly new QHost attack, which runs malicious code on users' computers when they navigate to unsafe Web sites. But Microsoft, like other software makers, has historically relied on an End User License Agreement (EULA) to protect itself from customers seeking restitution for the allegedly shoddy quality of its products. Is the EULA legally enforceable? Can Microsoft be held liable for problems, including financial losses, its customers accrue from using its software? Post your views...

 Hi Jax, Earlier, I was searching styles in the typepad url of the same blog.... Today I got it thankx, and yeah I like "simplistic" style the most.... coming to news aggregator I got some overview... If u dont mind suggest some freeware which is best suited for our purpose of news aggregation... Cheers

 Dear Ram, Go to my urlLink other blog . There will be a style switcher just like the one in this. Click on any of the styles to view them.

 Am back too.. aftre a quick weekend trip home... Many More Happy Returns of the Day, Valli... there's one reason that I can never forget ur b'day... Last year, it was this day, that I wrote my test in infy... Things seem that I might be released from the project next week or so.. let see... some problem with my system again... not connecting to network...Will update later on other things as soon as it gets going...

 Dear Ram, Here is an article that I wrote for my company's internal newsletter last week. What is a news aggregator? A news aggregator is "software that periodically reads a set of news sources, in one of several XML-based formats, finds the new bits, and displays them in reverse-chronological order on a single page." A few months back, we had seen about weblogs. Aggregators and weblog software are two sides of the same coin. Weblogs are for writing, while aggregators are for reading. How does it work? Every hour the aggregator reads the "feeds" or "sources" you're subscribed to, as few as a half-dozen, or as many as you like. The information is displayed it in a user-friendly format, one for each source. How do I get to read news? A computer, running an aggregator software, reads information from various sources. There are a wide range of sources, news websites, weblogs and even commercial sites. A search on google for "news aggregators" lists a range of software for reading news. There are news aggregator software for various operating systems. Recently Indian Express and Financial Express (the first from any Indian news website) have put up a "feed" containing the headlines, a brief description and links back to the full story available on their websites. Mostly all the "feed" available on the Internet are free. The news aggregator is an example of how technology can be used as an informative medium. Hope you understood it. More on this tomorrow or the day after.

 Hey Jax, What is this News Aggregator....(Desktop version, browser version etc...) Yeah coming to styles I use purple only.. I like that... light bkgrd.. dark text... by way I cant find any style on your other blogs... Can you give me the exact URL for those... Om prakash Sir, conveyed his wishes to u all....

 Hi all, Glad abt blogging after a long gap... BTW...Many more happy returns of the day valli... Jax here is the reason why we are not able to name folders and files with certain reserved words... Illegal file/folder names and conventions for the Windows Operating systems... The following file/folder names are reserved under Windows: com1, com2, com3, com4, com5, com6, com7, com8, com9, lpt1, lpt2, lpt3, lpt4, lpt5, lpt6, lpt7, lpt8, lpt9, con, nul, and prn. You cannot use these names for naming your folders and files. There are lot more reservations for naming files/folders in Windows. ok then..bye bye and meet u all in my next blog. Mahen.

 The good news is... It's your birthday! The bad news is... It's means you're growing older. The good news is... You'll get some gifts! The bad news is... You're still getting older. The good news is... There's cake and goodies! The bad news is... Yep, you're getting older. The good news is... You've got good friends, And we're ALL getting older! Have a wonderful day!

 So after several days, Rini has gone and reviewed the other blog and suggested improvements. Thank you. As for the book review, I have everything ready. The only thing to be done is integrating it with the blog. Due to some very tight work schedule, I was unable to put it up. Maybe the coming holidays might allow that. Have a happy hols everyone.

 By the way jax, the plum style seems to be good! Apart from that Sea, Guava are also good. Others not so appealing to me. In Dayswork blog, black is the best and all others are not that appealing. Coz they are all of the same background with only the color changes. But jaxsays blog has different layouts too which are appealing too. Can move plum, sea& guava too to dayswork if u and give off all those similar purple, mint, peach color styles. And those are all DOs commands i believe. PRN is for printing onto Parallel printer port and COM are for writing on to Communication ports i believe. So it might be like keywords of OS and so will not allow us to create folders of that name. Dont know exactly but! hope to see the correct answer soon.

 Hey huge hoardings, highly hair heightening.... By way I tried the kicha's one in Win Nt client, I get some error.... Gud, gr8 info. after quite some time...nice... by way as kicha has let out v r leaving tonight.... happy pooja.... Jax, I ought to learn french.. can you suggest some sites.... which provides from beginning that too free of cost... Cheers

 Oh, really i am unable to believe till now. Its a sad ending for one of the adored faculty of our course. May his soul rest in peace. Ok guys, have a nice and long & happppppy weekend. Me too am going to have a fine weekend. will tell all fun when i am back. and yesterday too i bunked my office as i dint feel like going. so to impress srini, i plunged still into the zone of cooking. Prepared some sweets and one special item, i mean Kolukattai to eat for dinner and not usual rice. He envied the way i was enjoying my leave. And dint feel like coming to office today. But then veetla irundha bore adikkumnu kelambi vandhutten. Hei guys, i have got a suggestion pa. Why not we write some reviews? Ya the way i have reviewed the casette Panchabhutam, why not people who read books like jax, kicha, ram, sindhu, valli and almost all i think read something or the other and keep in touch with the literary world. So it would be nice if we start posting some reviews. Need not exactly be on books, can be on Museums or exhibitions or casettes or any thing worth reviewing. Thats what i can say now. Gadsby good lipogram work! Ok then guys will meet u all after holidays............. bye for now

 You cannot name folders as such because they are name of devices used by the Windows File system. More info urlLink here . But MS says that WinNT and Win2K do not face this problem. Don't know if it is caused by Fat File System. Maybe it does not occur in a NTFS file system. Maybe Manny can help in this issue.

 Try this... You cannot create a folder with the same name as any of the following: CON, PRN, LPT1, LPT2 ... LPT9, COM1, COM2 ... COM9 Can you tell me why...? PS: It holds true for Win 2000/XP/2003 ... I have not tested on other OS's...

 There are more such works in several languages which leave out a particular letter. As you said " urlLink Gadsby " is one in English. urlLink Perec 's "La disparition" in French (available as "A Void" in English) also leaves out "e". I started reading Gadsby a couple of weeks ago, but never got around finishing it. BTW, any such works in Tamil?

 Wow.. What Wizadry Work... Wonderfully Woven... Wondering Who Wrote... I've also heard of another novel "Gadsby".. seems the entire novel was written without using the letter "e" ... jax, any lights on that...

 Hi all, I found this interesting story. Anyone care to tell me its uniqueness. "Warm weather, Walter! Welcome warm weather! We were wishing winter would wane, weren't we?" "We were well wearied with waiting," whispered Waiter wearily. Wan, white, woe-begone was Walter; wayward, willful, worn with weakness, wasted, waxing weaker whenever winter's wild, withering winds were wailing. Wholly without waywardness was Winifred, Walter's wise, womanly watcher, who, with winsome, wooing way, was well-beloved. "We won't wait, Walter; while weather's warm we'll wander where woodlands wave, won't we?" Walter's wanton wretchedness wholly waned. "Why, Winnie, we'll walk where we went when we were with Willie; we'll weave wildflower wreaths, watch woodmen working; woodlice, worms wriggling; windmills whirling; watermills wheeling; we will win wild whortleberries, witness wheat winnowed." Wisbeach woods were wild with wildflowers; warm, westerly winds whispered where willows were waving; wood-pigeons, wrens, woodpeckers were warbling wild woodnotes. Where Wisbeach water-mill's waters, which were wholly waveless, widened, were waterlilies, waxen white. Winifred wove wreaths with woodbine, whitehorn, wallflowers; whilst Walter whittled wooden wedges with willow wands. Wholly without warning, wild wet winds woke within Wisbeach woods, whistling where Winifred wandered with Walter; weeping willows were wailing weirdly; waging war with wind-tossed waters. Winifred's wary watchfulness waked. "Walter, we won't wait." "Which way, Winnie?" Winifred wavered. "Why, where were we wandering? Wisbeach woods widen whichever way we walk. Where's Wisbeach white wicket, where's Winston's water-mill?" WistfuIly, Walter witnessed Winifred's wonder. "Winnie, Winnie, we were wrong, wholly wrong; wandering within wild ways. Wayfaring weather-beaten waifs, well-nigh worn-out." Winifred waited where, within wattled woodwork walls, wagons, wheelbarrows, wains were waiting, weighty with withered wood. Walter, warmly wrapped with Winifred's well-worn wadded waterproof, was wailing woefully, wholly wearied. Winnie, who, worn with watching, well-nigh weeping, was wistfully, wakefully waiting Willie's well-known whistle, wholly wished Walter's well-being warranted. With well-timed wisdom, Walter was wound with wide, worsted wrappers, which wonderfully well withstood winter's withering, whistling winds. Wholly without warm wrappers was Winifred, who, with womanly wisdom, was watching Walter's welfare, warding Walter's weakness. "When will Willie wend where we wait?" wearily wondered Walter. "Whist, Walter," whispered Winnie, "who was whooping?" "Whereabouts?" Welcome whistling was waking Wisbeach woods when winter's windy warfare waxed weaker. "Winnie! Walter!" Winifred's wakefulness was well-grounded. "We're well, Willie; we're where Winston's wagons wait." Without waiting, Willie was within Winston's woodwork walls. "Welcome, welcome, Willie." Winnie was weeping with weariness with watching Walter, weak with wayfaring. "Why Winnie! Wise, watchful, warm-hearted Winnie," Willie whispered wheedlingly. "We won't weep; Walter's well. What was Walter without Winnie?" Wholly wonderful was Winifred's well-timed womanly wisdom, which well warranted weakly Walter's welfare. Whenever wandering within Wisbeach woods with Winnie, Walter would whisper, "What was Walter without Winnie? Wise, watchful, warm-hearted Winnie!" Good Luck!!

 The art of questioning has become a lost art today. We are being taught not to ask questions. It begins from childhood. a young child begins to understand its environment. It's mind is filled with curiosities about its surroundings. What it learns forms how it will act in the future. The child is told by its parents that this is good and this is bad. It accepts that as realities. It also learns a lot from its own experinces like hunger can make you cry and falling down hurts. It grows older. Our young lad/lass goes to school. Its mind is filled with premonitions about the school and the teachers there. S/he takes time to adjust to the new environment. S/he learns that there are a lot of children like her. S/he likes some and dislikes some. It cannot understand why. Soon a couple of years pass. S/he is now five years old, learning quite a lot of things in school and home. The mind is now more inquisitive now. Lots of questions arise in thier minds, but no one can answer them. Parents and teachers now unable to cope up with the flurry of questions adopt a new approach. They tell the child that it is wrong to question everything. They tell that the child will understand why some things are the way they are when they grow up. The child accepts this. It knows that if it asks questions, they may not be answered or worse, it might be admonished. Our lad/lass is now entering its pre-teen years. It understands that questioning things might lead into trouble and that it is better to accept or keep quiet. Inwardly looking, the child is like a pot, brimming and boiling with questions. But poor soul, what can it do? It accepts what it has been told or comes to its own conclusions. Teen years - the wonder years. The child is now aware of many things. It is now becoming increasingly aware of changes, both physically and mentally. It is still hard to find answers and questioning at this age is dangerous. Unable to find answers from the people it has known for years, it turns to other avenues for information. Some turn out wonderful guides and some turn out rotten. The teen years end, moving through college, work, marriage and finally, even at the deathbed, the child ponders on the questions left unanswered. The child could be you... Like I said, the art of questioning is lost, buried under fear, prejudices and pure stupidity. And people who question are treated as if they are some rebels. Kicha had pointed out instances where questioning led to eminence and improvement of society. Yet it has been drummed into our minds that questioning is wrong. It means you are not trusting what people say; It means that you do not respect your elders; it means that you are not grown up. I could go on with a similar list. I remember an anectode I read. An outgoing teacher tells his new young replacement the following words. "In every class, you might find that there is someone who is eager to question your every statement. Your first impulse would be silence him. But before that, consider this. He might be the only person who is listening to your words." Interesting, if only teachers listened to this advice. This does not mean that nor do I endorse that you should question everything. I say that if you don't know something or don't understand something, question. And never let go till you find out the answer. And that requires courage and tenacity. A Norse proverb says, "It's better to ask twice than to lose your way once."

 Hi, as always it is nice to see everyone sharing their thoughts and views on various topics. One small note on posting: Avoid using font and marquee tags. Instead of b, use strong, and em instead of i. When you are including quotations, use the blockquote tag, instead of using align=center. Whenever possible, give your post a title and avoid the apostrophe sign Hope no one is inconvenienced by these suggestion, these are to improve your HTML skills and also have a semantic blog. If you want to know more on semantic, try googling. I'll post my views on the last few posts later.

 Hai all, A couple of days before, Bala was emphasizing that technology has made human being lethargic in all ways and means. I do agree that technology had made human inhuman, lethargic in some ways. But not in all. You might be wondering that why myself is speaking something without any correlation with the heading I posted?. There is relationship. Today, I participated in urlLink Coimbatore IT.com(Achieving India's IT Vision 2008). Among the speakers were Mr.VivekhariNarain(IT Secretrary,Govt of TN), Mr.Subramaniam(President & CEO, Covansys), Mr.Ravichandran(Sr.VP,olaris lab) etc., In the seminar, a lot of topics were delivered on BPO, Bioinformatics and Achieving Vision 2008 etc. But, the interesting part of the session was e-governance by Dr.Karthikeyan,(Commissioner,Coimbatore Corporation). His explanation, eye for details about e-governance is simply astonishing. He explained us elaborately about e-governance, How coimbatore corporation is doing reforms and carrying out infrastructural and corporation activities. How general public can pay taxes through payment gateways by means of their urlLink Coimbatore Corporation website. He also showed a live demo how the general public feel about this modern way of using paying taxes through their website. You know what was the reply from an 60 year old citizen?(Middle class Indian). He said it is very amazing, he spend only 3-5 minutes in paying taxes. He also added that the corporation response is very positive in all the problem solving aspects(Like handling of enquiries like water problem, road problem etc). Mr.Karthikeyan is only 31 years old. He was honoured with Best e-governance implementor for the year 2001 by Mr.L.K.Advani(Dy.PM). Technology is growing for the people. We must see it as a boon for our life, not as a stumbling block. Bye for now.

 That was the caption of Ms Office XP. Relevant too for what am going to say. Just reminding you of Ranjini's lines in one of her posts - the inspiration behind this post..!! "....... is not a problem which is identified today but then long time back and a vivid solution to all such things were also proposed by eminent writers to be followed by all! " A phrase that needs to be looked upon with utmost care and caution. There is always a tendency for everyone to "accept" something from someone who is "eminent" (and "eminent" is a relative term). The human mind is so much attuned to "follow" the "greats" that we often tend to forget our ordinability in life... That stems from the fact that we feel that we know "lesser" compared to some people who are accepted to be eminent across times... Not completely untrue... I don't say we know "more".. but that, we have the power of discretion and of course the "common sense" that is expected to ring the horns on our heads to whatever the mind tries to perceive. What was stated as "this" by the 'eminent' person may not be "that" for me. But the mind often forces us to reject our thoughts and rather falls upon what the 'eminent' person has said, just because we feel "I can never be as right as that 'eminent' person. After all, the whole world agrees he's eminent...". This same theory can be extended to religion and religious practices. We do things just because some 'knowledgeable' person has said it should be done. I take you back to one of my earlier post about superstitions.. and am precisely referring to those same aspects. There is also a demarcation between being spiritual and being religious.. (I'll devote a separate post to that last line later, may be next week)... Religiousness is, among other things, predominantly confined to practices laid down my "eminent" and "knowledgeable" persons of the ancient/medieval times, while spirituality is beyond the realms of religious practices. If Galileo had accepted Aristotle's (who was an "eminent" scholar himself) Geo-centric theory, we would still be languishing and puzzling over a maze called "space". If Einstein did not dare to "assume" that nothing can travel faster than light, we would not have got the Relativity theory. These people became eminent because they had the guts to reject eminent people of their times. The bottomline is.. Of course, listen to your elders, teachers, sacred books, philosophy or the deemed eminent personalities.. but do remember, its not in reading sacred books or listening to 'eminent' people, that one gains wisdom... But, Listen to your feelings. Listen to your Highest Thoughts. Listen to your experience. Whenever any one of these differ from what you've been told by your teachers or read in your books, forget the words. Words are the least reliable purveyor of Truth. And you have to dare to do that...!! ----------------------------- Moral certainty is always a sign of cultural inferiority. The more uncivilized the man, the surer he is that he knows precisely what is right and what is wrong. All human progress, even in morals, has been the work of men who have doubted the current moral values, not of men who have whooped them up and tried to enforce them. The truly civilized man is always skeptical and tolerant, in this field as in all others. His culture is based on "I am not too sure." - H.L. Mencken

 yes ram and sindhu...It was really touching and in fact I never felt missing my father till date...but as I read that poem I was able to feel myself on the day when I might miss my dad... Cares & Shares Mahendran Jayavel

 Hey Mahendran, that is really a moving piece of work! Ranjini, I am anazed at your growing interest in multiple fields. Its true that if you have passion for something, you will definitely find time for it. Kudos...carry on. The discussion is too good that i find myself in a limbo between Bala's view and the rest. Thogh there is not much i could say as everything have been said... Had it not been for the technology i woudnt even have dreamt about coming to UK let alone living...the only link between me and my loved ones is the blessed phone and the gifted internet. Regarding the working hours, people in western countries goive utmost priority to their personal life, they make it a point not to work during weekends and after 5 pm in the weekdays. But in most cases its the other way round in India. Even if you dont want to you are forced to work longer hours, which means compromising personal life. Problem lies in our work culture. We may be living in a mechanical world but it doesnt mean that our love for our dear ones is going into the drains. Grinding chutney with stones and washing clothes with my hands will definitely give me pleasure but will my fast paced environment let me have time for these things. The answer will probably be a big ' No '. We perfectly understand that this is not the only way to show your love for someone. People had been expressing their love before centuries back, when the word ' technology ' sounded alien, and will continue to do so, but with a touch of modernisation as long as they have a genuine love.

 Hi, Visit this urlLink Non_Patriarchal and ponder ur thoughts. Manny, its really exhilarating (Daddy's day... fantastic) Cheers

 Removed due to copyright infringement. Please see this urlLink post .

 Thatz it... Jax "what if technology begins to control us?..." I hope Bala is trying to emphasize this in different manner... I do agree with Kishore & Valli, yeah certainly's Manny's quote on how to use it.... But... the point here is... rn't we dependent on Technology rather to put us we are making use of it... Can you stay a whole night if "Storm" rolls the electricity out...Then the city becomes a dessert / forest... yeah, U have to have control you rather than the technology... as Kicha points out... we have to switch off mobile to chew the fat lethargically.... it wont automatically sense ur mood (I heard Bill Gate's Home is designed so, How far its true, I have to taste and say) Valli, If there is no mixer / grinder u should have prepared urself to grind on those 2 stones or wash with the gentle palm in a single stone in cases of no current.... R V prepared for that. is the question here to put?????? Get going.... I will come out with spl.. matters.... Cheers....

 It's been a long time since I updated it. In fact the last time I updated it was back in May. Currently I'm using it as a testing blog. Take a look at the layout urlLink there . Since most items that I wanted topost there is being posted at Quod scripsi, scripsi , I decided to change its focus towards something else. I've got a couple of ideas about the directions that Rantings of a sane mind should take. I guess it might be the end of the year before it gets sorted out. So you'll have to wait for some time before it gets back on track. I wouldn't agree that bloging is my hobby. It has become a part of my regular life nowadays. Since we use the blog as a platform for discussing, I don't feel that blogging is a hobby. It's more like a indirect conversation. You were right in saying that reading cannot be considered a hobby. Searching for a definition of hobby gave me these descriptions: hobby: (noun) - An activity or interest pursued outside one's regular occupation and engaged in primarily for pleasure; an auxiliary activity; a subject or plan upon which one is constantly setting off; a favorite and ever-recurring theme of discourse, thought, or effort; that which occupies one's attention unduly, or to the weariness of others; a ruling passion. Considering point no. 4, 5 and 6, can it be presumed that love is a hobby? Any thoughts.

 Google is testing software that lets people navigate the Web without opening up an Internet browser, placing itself in a field that Microsoft has designs on -- desktop search. On Thursday, the Mountain View, Ca.-based search company debuted the Google Deskbar. The downloadable software for users of Microsoft's Windows operating system puts a Google search box in the desktop taskbar. Using the free tool, people can search for information on the Web while in a Word document or e-mail application. But instead of launching a browser, the Deskbar will display results in a small window in the lower right of the screen.

 What happened to that blog jax?

Very nice his voice is! ya , the auditorium was jam packed and when we went, there was no seat and can u imagine, people were sitting in the pathway and on the stage-near the performer, outside the auditorium-in the verandah, standing at the entrance of the auditorium and in almost all places. We too sat in the pathway and listenend. It was a different experience sitting there and listening. We sat in the pathway at the center and so could clearly see him. His gestures are funny but at the same time are pleasant too. Something different it was for me! Enjoyed it like anything! Ya both music and his gestures. What Mahen any more blogs on Five sense or Ok guys, i will blog later bye for now

 i am sorry, i dint inform u people, coz i was not so regular in posting it, though i had decided to do so. So thought will inform, once i go in full swing, but then since u people have found it out, i now declare it to u all! urlLink Flowers for you ! Thanx for ur comments. All of you do pay a visit and let me know ur opinion too. i will provide a contact link thru which u can communicate with me too. Its not yet fully developed and i need to add some more stuff to the blog. Actually, i took this as an exercise to post about a flower, everyweek to a group of people and at the same time, i used to update this blog also. but then since i had some work, i just couldnot continue doing so, this month. And since u people find it interesting, i will notify u all when updated. It will b usually friday of every week. Apart from this, i do am maintaining another blog, which contains some great works in English literature and some interesting articles regarding them. They are in the blog urlLink Elite-essays . I have talked about this blog before too. When time permits do pay a visit to this blog. There is an article about the poem The Wasteland in this blog, which is much relevant to what is being discussed these days in our blog. In the poem The Waste Land , the poet T.S.Eliot has long time back talked about the complexities and problems of Modern world. Here are few lines from the essay on wasteland As there could be no vegetation in a wasteland there is no sense of fulfillment in the modern world. In this modern world man-woman relationship has degenerated to the level of animality. Spiritual grace should come like rains and revive the moral life on this earth. This religious theme has inspired Eliot to write The waste land . Interstingly he has also given solution to such problems and amazingly its taken from Brahadaranyaka Upanishad ! Isnt it interesting? Modernisation backed by technology is not a problem which is identified today but then long time back and a vivid solution to all such things were also proposed by eminent writers to be followed by all! But are we aware of such things and are we following it if we are aware is what is to be paid attention now. Coz to learn from other's experience(if one is worthy) is wise than to wait for one's own experience.

 How do we define hobby?....can we put it this way?...... Anthing you do, apart from your profession, that gives you pleasure & mental relaxation, & that is considered to be contructive. Blogging is your hobby.....creating blogs is your pleasure......reading(I don't know, now-a-days it might help you in your profession) can also be considered...Listining to music & writing all those words in your brown diary(remember you were just behind me for two years)....you've even shown that diary to me once.....however, it was like greek & latin, to me...... Trying to be a down-to-earth person????..... I can even say that there's no man without hobbies......everbody should be doing something that relaxes them....that might not seem to be a hobby to them......I can never accept the statement "I don't have a hobby".... BTW, you don't have sing that song(which i did'nt understand too), to welcome me......I'm just so much excited....can't wait to see my parents..... expecting our first snow this week.....ooooohhh i walk out now, i'll freeze...even with my winter jackets...... yet to read Rini's new blog....

 Rini, just I had a look at your blog. Wonderful!! Tell me how you get time to do all these things.. Hope you are very passionate about flowers.... Nice. Thought of reading the whole thing sometime later. Some interesting discussion is going on. .... I accept valli's and kicha's arguments..everything depends on how you plan your life...External factors may try to take control over your life only when you are allowing it. I bought a book of osho 'A cup of tea' and trying to read it. Just gone through 2 pages till now. It's good. Valli..It's nice to hear taht you are coming to india...Just I got to know.When you are coming? I am going home this weekend. taking leave on friday for my friends marriage. Planning to visit cbe on friday..let me see. Hope Again I will be tied up with work from next week. My PL is going to onsite for different assignment and we will be doing all the co-ordination and work. Next week I going to have some training in .Net. I am searching for a good library here in adyar...After I joined here I can tell you that I haven't finished reading any book. Just 2 or 3 books I started and it's still in half way..:(( I got mail from vijaybabu.. he was describing his locality like his house is surrounded by gardens, swimming pool ,etc. Hope he is enjoying life. See you all soon in next blog..Have Nice Time..!!

 Rini, I don't remember you mentioning about your blog, urlLink Flowers Flowers Flowers! here. Just now got back from reading it. It's wonderful. And to think that you had kept it for almost three months is unacceptable. Maybe you had transferred your garden here. Hmm! no posts for this month yet. Good work on the blog. Hey everybody, visit the blog.

 It's good to see a discussion taking place after quite some time. BTW what are we discussing about. Bala said that technology and modern life is taking a toll on our way of living. He cited a few instances where he would have been better off without the intervention of technology. Kicha replies that,"our innate feelings have taken the back seat... " since technology has invaded entered our lives. He said that we have no option left and that it is not the technology that is to blame, but the people. Our prioritizing (or rather the lack of it) is what causes the problems. Valli has cited an example where prioritizing allows her to enjoy a better life. And she also gave examples of how technology gave her some freedom echoing a few thoughts said by Kicha. Manny, Valli and Kicha have all said that technology is in the hands of the individual, not the reverse. Amazingly everyone has a valid point in agreeing that we cannot do without technology in the modern world. The question, what if technology begins to control us, is best left for sci-fi authors and writers to answer. As long we don't surrender the things that makes us human to technology, we are doing fine. " Within this realm of choicelessness, we do choose how we live ". - Joseph Epstein Coming back to my opening statement, what are we discussing about, 'Is technology ruining us or helping us?" Can someone tell me? Interestingly Bala also said that " Simple pleasures in life will make a huge difference. " I wonder why no one has any comments on that statement. So instead of giving a few examples and explanations on whether technology is ruining our lives, I will speak about simple pleasures in life. There are several such things that can help you a lot. Small things like Rini's newest hobby of collecting pictures of Indian sculptures or Manny's hobby of reading books may seem a waste of your precious time, but they are helpful in your life. I recall a story that I read somewhere, I guess in "The Seven Habits". A new recruit to a group of woodcutters noticed that every couple of hours the woodcutters would stop their work and spend some fifteen to twenty minutes talking and joking. He thought that he should not be wasting that time (roughly one hour everyday). So for the next few days, he did not join the others during thier breaks and instead worked hard. At the end of the day, he felt proud that he had not wasted his day. But he noticed that the others had cut the same amount of wood that he had cut, inspite of them wasting an hour during the day. He couldn't understand it. Watching them keenly during the next couple days, he understood why. During the breaks that the woodcutters took, they sharpened their axes fine. The moral is that you can indulge in pleasures without compromising on anything. I feel that everyone should cultivate a hobby. It can be anything. Anything that you feel is precious to you and worth spending some time on it. BTW, Rini, what happenend to your garden. But I have to confess that I don't have a hobby. A hobby has to pursued with zeal and determination, which I feel I lack. Nowadays, I just go out at night as fast as I can on my vehicle. It is a refreshing experience. Especially with Coimbatore having a wonderful winter climate this year. The best times to go out is after 10 pm with little or no traffic and the fine mist descending to the ground. You should feel the cool wind blowing on your face, a mild shiver passing through your body, your breath forming little clouds in the air. It is an experience to be enjoyed. I guess it is hard to experience a similar feeling in Chennai now, but Bangalore, Lexington (i guess it is around 1 or 2 degrees C there) and Hinckley (what's the weather there, 10-11 degrees C) would provide the right climate for experience what I had described. Waiting to see where the discussion will lead, BTW, Kicha, your closing quote form Lennon was quite apt. But since quite a few people might have heard that song, I am posting the lyrics to the song. It becomes more meaningful. Imagine there's no heaven, It's easy if you try, No hell below us, Above us only sky, Imagine all the people living for today... Imagine there's no countries, It isn't hard to do, Nothing to kill or die for, No religion too, Imagine all the people living life in peace... Imagine no possesions, I wonder if you can, No need for greed or hunger, A brotherhood of man, Imagine all the people Sharing all the world... You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one, I hope some day you'll join us, And the world will live as one. Though this song may seem unrelated to our discussion, I felt that everyone can have a good feel of a world if we can just imagine. I hope you feel inspired by the song.

 Having said and read all these about technology and its ill and good effects, I just remember an analogy, which I read from the book Living with Honour ...When somebody throws a dagger towards you, there are two ways to catch that. Either with the blade or with the handle...This is how we should see the technology and its effects and its up to u as to how you handle it.... Cares & Shares Mahendran Jayavel

 Bala & Kicha....That was awesome......Hope i can expect an interesting counter arguement for this from Bala...... I'm sligtly inclined towards Kicha's arguements......One line was really catchy.."Choose your Priority"...... Bala, career & work life is important....but life does not end with your office.......which might be hard for you to understand at this stage of your life.....Seeing your dreams & goals come true, is your only point of focus now..... I can quote a few examples from my own experience......Ganesh used to work till midnight, before mrg....but now he makes it a point to be at home before 7.00P.M.....Does that mean that he's not working for what he's paid?...He's just learned to balance both his work & personal life. Bala, is it practically possible for somebody to make chutney from a stone grinder (I would'nt even call it a grinder....two stones....It's the hands that actually does the grinding).....Do you know that rice cooked in a rice cooker or an ordinary cooker is more nutritiuos than the older method of boiling it in a pot of water & finally draining all the starch?....Technology does help you to have nutritious food.....The curry powder which i use for my day to day cooking, is the one which my mom prepared for me(because we don't get it here...& i myself don't know to prepare it)..So how am i going to preserve it for an year or so, without my freezer...Does'nt technology help me out there?...... Technology has made the whole world as a global village.....Can you imagine doing an out-of-book college assignment without the help of google or any of the search engines?..... If you blame Edison for inventing brightness, why don't you travel even more backwards on the time wheel & complain the invention of zero(we Indians)...if there was'nt any zero, there would have been no math at all.....We would have still been as earlymen counting herds with stones.....making no use of the sixth sense..... It was not only Indians who lost their jobs, the whole world suffered.....Economy is a cycle of booms & dips...just like a sine wave.....You did'nt complain technology, in a rising economy....& you should'nt complain technology for the fall, because it was you & me who made the field to saturate, & when the level of tolerance exceeded, baaaaaaaang! When people here ask us, what are we doing & when we say that Ganesh is a software engg...& i'm a programmer & computer student...they have been giving this feed back always......"Ahhh! i know. you guys are really good at that"...Is'nt this something we have to be proud of?....Indians are considered to be intellectuals.....Had it not been for the IT revolution, we would have still been unnoticed...... One final pleasant news....another feather in India's crown because of technology.....One of the American channels is going to telecast a program "India the future super power, because of IT".......A fast spreading news amongst the Indians here....Got this message from Vinitha yesterday..... Technology can be used both ways..... a constructive weapon as well as destructive weapon.... It all depends on the hands that uses it!!

 Interesting article by Bala... its so true that in the guise of shrinking the world with technology our innate feelings have taken the back seat... But having said that, my question is.. are we left with an alternate option... We are talking globalization, competition... The days of a laid-back Govt job, that gives you job security for life and also takes care of ur post-retirement life has become a thing of the past... the days where one could start from home at a comfortable 9AM and be back by 6PM are only available to be seen in films... On the other hand... the "cursed" WebCam is what enables an anxious mom to see her child's face who might be working thousands of miles away... imagine the happiness in her face... the equally "cursed" VoIP is what helps the beloved talk with her overseas counterpart without losing much weight in her purse... Did anyone ever think that a simple coffee could ever be made into so many different varieties... Did the pre-modern man ever had the privilege of tasting food stuff from across the globe right at his door step... some may not be all that good for health... but then, given the pollution levels, even breathing is bad for health... Washing machines and the chutney grinders may not do as neat or as delicious a work as does the dear one's (which normally refers to the female "dear") palm.. but it does give a break to her tired palm.. how many more eras will the so-called "dear one" spend in washing and cooking... that palm could also be used for some other creative work other than just washing and cooking that she's been doing for ages... So.. the bottomline is.. its the way you "choose" to use it... prioritize ur activity... the means are available for u... its up to you to put that to proper use... once in a while, a visit to coffee day or McDonalds is going to be enriching... but not if we do it everyday.. as the cliche goes "too much of anything is good for nothing"... Valli talks to her mom on weekends.. technology enables her... Bala himself has got a mobile for some special reasons... technology is helping him... And this very medium of discussion is because of a technology... Don't choose to use technology just because it is there... use it when there is a need to use... just as the simple difference between "want" and "need"... you drink coke... but you'll never use it as a replacement for water.. if you try to do it, that's where the dangers of technology begin.. as long as u don't do it... u have both coke's refreshing taste and also the impeccable panacea called water... if u understand what I mean...!! To quote bala... tell me one pleasant moment you and your loved one chewed the fat without being disturbed by a mobile call? If "chewing the fat" with your loved one is sooooo very important.. then, why the HELL don't you switch ur mobile off...??? Choose ur priority...!! Problem is with people.. not technology..!! --------------------- You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one. I hope some day you'll join us, And the world will live as one. - John Lennon, "Imagine"

 Dear Friends, I thank all the good souls for your wishes and greetings on My Birthday. A special word of thanks goes to Rajesh and Bala(Ask them). They called me and wished me sharp @ 12 O'clock. I cut the cake with my room friends sharp @12 O'Clock. Then it was cake abhisegam like our PG birthday celebration. Those days are still evergreen in my mind. Nice to hear Valli returning home with Mr.Ganesh. I think this will be II thalai pongal for her. Sindu, nee eppo return with unnoda hubby ooda. I have an article why the Americans celebrate thanks giving during the 4th thursday in November On the fourth Thursday in November, Americans celebrate Thanksgiving. We have a special meal and give thanks for our blessings. This tradition began with the first European settlers in North America as a celebration of the harvest in 1621. Some of the foods included in the meal are turkey, cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes, and pumpkin pie. What about Vijay? Has he become the sole propreitor of Patni. Bye for now

 Ranjini...visit this link abt urlLink temples in India....quite a comprehensive coverage of Indian temples...hope there are some archives of photo files of India temples.

 Hi everybuddy, Hope our class boys and husbands of our class girls are working hard. When my brain takes the topic of working hard and growth it coerces me to think about the technological growth. Putting myself as an evangelist I am captivated, but conversely there are blues. Let me put it elaborate. Technology yields growth and makes me lazy. Technology gives wealth and keeps me away from the rest. If there wasn’t an idiot thing called Tele Vision I would have interacted more with my family. If there wasn’t a stupid device called mobile, my passion towards meeting people would have been more. If at all there was Edison I would have slept at the earliest. If there is no such thing known as computers I would not have had much of my Indian brothers without work. Two or three plastic cards, a mobike, mobile, billiards or snookers, coffee day; my like and dislike isn’t a matter of consideration. I am forced to have these. Aren’t we missing the pleasures of meeting our loved person after years of separation? (Curse webcams, VOIP’s, Internet, e-mail etc.) When was the last time you had food with all your family members present?? (curse hot packs, refrigerators..) tell me one pleasant moment you and your loved one chewed the fat without being disturbed by a mobile call? Isnt there a difference between a machine washing your dear one’s clothes and you doing it for him/her? Isnt there a difference between automatic oven and your loved ones palm? Simple pleasures in life will make a huge difference. As Murtu puts it “we are marching towards making of a materialistic world”. We are playing for the sake of playing and not for the sake of pleasure. In future if I am blessed with a whole Sunday with my dear, It makes sense for me to switch of my mobile, TV etc., and prepare a cup of black tea and say “I LOVE YOU DEAR” instead of taking her to a coffee day and order for two capacinos. Somewhere we need to draw line between artificial good things and real good things. Test it by yourself….. Chutney from mixer grinder and chutney from the stone grinder. Taste will tell you which is the real good thing. (tring tring….) it’s a call in my mobile and am returning to the dubious world. Bye Bala

 I am living with Honour ...as per the Tamilnadu Government, I am living with Honour with a "H" seal in my family's ration card...ha ha.

 Living With Honour by Shiv Khera Hi pals, Yesterday Shiv Khera talked to me!!! enna puriyalaya...I bought a new addition to my book shelf...."Living With Honour" by Shiv Khera...Read few pages in the shop itself out of curiosity (Irukkatha pinna...ranjinyoda voracious listla vanthathula irunthu i became a fierceful reader...ha ha...) nice to read...still going on with my reading...One of the lines in the book which I liked in the first few pages that I read was... "Often when our conscience tries to call us, the line is too busy..." Yet to read in full and i dont want to make it in a rush...good book and rest 'bout that in my next blogs... Cares & Shares Mahendran Jayavel

 Valli, Good to hear that you'll be in India soon, Athukaga "Ghar aaja Pardesi.."nnuu engalala padda mudiyadhu. Sri, a very happy birthday da. Hope you have a wonderful day today. RIni, how are your dance and music classes going on? Planning on any arengetram soon. Send me your contact no's. Kicha and Ram, you too send your numbers. Last night, Saw "Alaipayuthey" for the n th time, where n>20. This time on DVD. Though Rahman has mixed and improved the tunes of Alaipayuthey in 'Saathiya', nothing beats the original. The background score has the best till date from Rahman. Nothing to say about Mani Ratnam's direction and the camera-work by PC Sreeram. A wonderful story. Tonight, I'll be watching "Kannathil Muthmamittal". The two movies came packaged as a single DVD. Meanwhile, here are a few urlLink things to do when your net connection goes down.

 Welcome Bala... to the exciting world of blogging... hope to see "different" and "creative" posts from u... So, one more into the arena... urlLink And then there was chaos...

 Welcome Bala.....adhu enna chottu mottu????....... Rini....kai kuduthadharkku nandri......Nalla kaadhukku iniya aangila sorkkal, Rajesh kaaha select panni vai.....oru kai paathudalaam...... Manny, nee vaenumnae dhaan purse roomla vittittu ponaennu naan solluraen...... Nalla technique ka irukkae idhu....... Nice to see ganesh's & Sindhu's post after quiet a long time..... BTW, a slight change in our plans....Ganesh is also coming, but for the last two weeks.. I'll be there on Jan 13th.... Talked to my boss & Proff....everything is sorted out..... This week end is a long one for us....Thanks giving......second greatest festival, next to Christmas......we've got four days....But guess, we'll not be going anywhere......two days will just go in hosting dinner.....one day all of Ganesh's bachelor friends ....& the next day, one of our family friends...

 hi , ranjini definitely i will get u the snap as soon as possible. since no friends here in kumbakonam iam watching all the movies without fail. nowadays all films seems to be good. thirumalai, jj, eyarkai all can be seen once.planning to go to kurumbu today. bye

 hi , ranjini definitely i will get u the snap as soon as possible. bye

 hi jax, i did the hair cut just on saturday and so havent taken any snaps till date. by the way, its a U cut and i have left my hair floating - untied. So it looks different says everyone at my office. Will post soon when i take one.

 Rini, i'll have to see itto believe it. So why don't you post any of your snaps taken after your haircut to your Yahoo! Photos. Also I would also like to see photos taken by others (Valli, Sindhu, Ram, Manny etc.) to the Yahooo Groups or through mail. Though I cannot send you any photos, I'll try to send you as much information about sculptures whenever possible.

 Dear friends, i am interested in collecting some of the best sculptures residing in our temples. So if anybody go to some historic temple, can u please take a snap of them and send me a copy too? I can bear the amount in printing, developing and couriering by sending u an M.O. And ganesh, i need this help from u, yes, if u happen to go to Tarasuram, do visit Airateswarar temple. its a very beautiful one belonging to 12th century and its the same temple which i had mentioned in one of our earlier blog. Do get me snap of the Gajasamhara murthy and other idols if possible. Actually there is a museum in which they have got the photograph of such idols. If u could take a snap of it and send me i would M.O u the amount it costs. Since i dint carry a camera, i couldnot catch them. But i need them. so do it when u are free..... please! Hei guys, u know what, i have cut my hair, yes, its no more longer as it was when i was doing M.S. so those who meet me next time, dont wonder at my new outlook! bye for now Ranjini



 Ram, hope you had a very nice birthday yesterday. Sorry da, I don't have your Bang. contact number. Infact I don't have any ones'c contact numbers at Bangalore. Could you send me your number, office and home or PP. (Kicha's and Rini's too). Well da Bala, I see your first post was a "chotta" one. Hoping to see a bada post from you soon. Kicha, Yes, it is deplorable. I guess that our Union Minister might have had the intention to make the selection process transparent. But how far it will be transparent is to be seen. Yesterday afternoon, I watched Dreamcatcher on DVD. It was wonderful. It wasn't scary like Sinduja had conveyed in one of her urlLink posts . I haven't read the book by urlLink Stephen King , the best selling horror fiction author. But I guess the director had toned down the horror factor in this film. Though many books by Stephen King have been made into urlLink movies , the best was " urlLink The Shawshank Redemption ". Rini, you can add Stephen King to my list of favorite authors. He writes horror stories. But the above film, The Shawshank Redemption was one of best movies that was ever made. If you get a chance to see it, don't miss it. It is not a horror film. The film portrays the strength of the human spirit in such beauty that the film lifts you up. Coming back to Dreamcatcher, the location where the movie was shot was so beautiful that it takes your breath away. The alien creatures were not frightening. But the idea of a memory warehouse, a virtual storehouse where the hero stores his memory is so innovative and appealing, that I wish I had one like that. The movie had interesting dialogues with lot of humor that you forget that it is supossed to be a horror movie. The background score was impeccable, suiting the movie to a T. Last night, I viewed another film, Maverick, starring Mel Gibson and Jodie Foster. a hilarious comedy. I have not yet seen it fully, only about a half an hour or so. I'm planning to watch the rest tonight. More later,

 Ciao guys n gals, That is a laudable debate by Infy Intelligent (Kicha). I take stance as a mid man here like the verdict of a â€œpatti mandramâ€�. Just for the sake that our seniors (age or experience) have been practicing something I cannot take it for granted. If that is so then we would have missed the â€˜out of the box thinkingâ€™ which I admire the most. Every generation is augmented with intelligence and sense of reasoning. Before a brand new idea egg hatches the next updated idea egg is delivered. I recollect, â€œIf you want to stay where you are today, keep runningâ€� If we need to keep up with the pace it becomes necessary for us to leave even the good things ( recall my earlier blog) then how come we can practice something which has no reasoning on its back.. If there is an answer for â€˜so what?â€™ in all my Grandmaâ€™s words I donâ€™t mind following that. If she doesnâ€™t have one and if at all you accept that my reasoning power is also good, then I would leave my brain to decideâ€¦ Kicha: I find some â€œdata type mismatchâ€�error in this mail da do u? Valli: Chottu means Intelligent in Portugal. When u come to India get me a bottle of wine Xavi : dei naanae dictionary paathu copy adichu than type pandran nee yennai meeruva pola irukku. Kavi: Kya ho gaya? Visbab: Patniyala(PCS) paavam bombayla Patniya irukkan pola. Rajesh: irukkan irukkan Sri: yevanda professionals madhiyila ivana sethadhu????

 Hi all, Xavi- Thanks for your welcome note da. For the rest : Greetings ! lads and old ladies. Will be back like a bang sooooooooon . chottu

 Hope u are aware of what is happening around... the entire gamut of future-managers suffering because of some unscrupulous idiots... My point here is not that, the leak of CAT question papers springs a surprise.. In fact, it does not..!! For, such things have been the order for a lot of prestigiuous degrees... But what is surprising is what I read in urlLink The Hindu this morning... Besides the CBI investigation, the Union Human Resource Development Minister, Murli Manohar Joshi, has decided to constitute a separate inquiry into paper leakage. It was only last week that the Ministry had indicated a likelihood of asking IIMs to restructure the CAT process by doing away with group discussions and interviews to make it more transparent. I wonder why people are trying to infuse politics into education at the levels of IIMs and IITs which have earned worldwide acclaim for the quality of students it produces. Was he thinking that he could enable people to "sell" themselves to the IIMs by scrapping the GD/interview in the name of "transparency"...?? Its better for the students and the country as long as politicians don't interfere with the affairs and procedures of such premier institutes of the country and leave it to the persons who really "know" what they are doing...

 Hi all, just now invited Bala to the blog. Hope to see his posts soon. BYe for now,

 Hi, Being in SBU-Tirupur BDE for more than 1 year, I learnt a lot from Tirupur. Here is a gist of it. Tirupur is located in Coimbatore district, 54 Kms away from Coimbatore(Bala veetula iruntha just 6 km than!!!). Most people are mainly into Garment Exports. The turnover of Tirupur per year is estimated to be about Rs.7500 crores. Many foreign companies like urlLink Wal-Mart , urlLink JC Penny , urlLink FUBU , Classic polo are outsourcing their T-shirts from here. Some of the main exporters in Tirupur are Eastman Exports, Premdurai Exports, Stallion Garments. Around 3,00,000 people are getting employment directly and indirectly from these garment companies. Many people from near by cities like Coimbatore, Erode, Somanur, Avanashi are coming to job by means of train to Tirupur.(Yours truly is one of them). Indian Cricket and Hockey team players are made in Tirupur. Tirupur has taken order to supply garments for the forecoming urlLink Athens 2004 olympics Garments are designed for different ages from Kids to Old people. Garments are designed by taking into consideration of design, aesthetics, colour. Nearly 1500 big companies(nearly 70% are ISO 9001:2000 Certified, 35% are ISO 14001 Certified companies are here. Tirupur supports well for the revenue for Government of Tamilnadu. Tirupur is spearheading in revenues after Chennai. But, Tirupur lacks behind is in the professionalism in which people work. Even Tirupur is financially very strong, but infrastructure is very worst. Ok I will continue my Tirupur episode again , after some time Nanban Ramgopalkum, Sogothari Josibakum en inya pirantha naal nal valthugal. Bye for now

 Hi, Back again to office today. I was on leave for the past two days as I went to Thirumala and had a big fight with Lord venkatesa... he tried a lot to convince me but in vain... Had a goood darshan of Lord Venkatesa...The interesting part is that our president APJ, Chandrababu and the governor of andhra visited Thirumala just 30 minutes before we entered thirumala...high security and there was enough crowd due to president's arrival... enjoyed a lot in this ptrip to thirupathi with my anna... we both went there and there was pretty good crowd...everybody was rushing their way to see the lord and running literally like a stampede...at one point in time me and my anna also started running on our way...ha ha...once it happenend that my brother ran too fast in between the crowd and i started shouting ..."Anna ipdi vittuttu odureengale annaannu, govidhaaa vittuttu oduriye govindhaannu...haeeeeeeheeee...because i left my purse in the room and also i dont know the way also pretty well to the room and if i miss him then we may end up searching each other....ha ha...govinda govindannu kathikitte odinen...ha ha... This is my first visit to tirupathi since my birth... imm...let me see what's there in store for me from yeluguntalavaaadaaaaaaa for all these troubled and infact joyful dharshan!!!... and coming to dogs... imm...ranjini is right...nee unnoda voracious readers listla ennai sekkalannu three days aluthen theriyuma....he e hehhehehhehheeeeeeee... ippo kooda alugaya varuthu....nee sethukitta appuram thaan alugaye ninnuchu...ha ha... apram valli actually i started my research on man and ended up in dogs eventually(.............what to do...may be this may further lead me to apes and chimps....) I want to make a point here...hope u all remember a post by our blog father abt butterflies...so this dog's episode can be thought of as another episode of blog father's...okva... (rest about other animals in future...) Coming to VVS...i hope all VVS members are in great varutham nowadays...no posts and active participation...may be a number of reasons can be attributed for that...one being all the members of VVS except me Ram jax and kishore may not have enough access to the net and systems... so far me ram ajayan kishore ganesh jax vijay and bala are the members of VVS rini...let me try out something to make it more lively and interactive...the fact is that I dont have enough experience as our blog father has and I suppose that I may not be able to devote my time and effort to format the blogs ( thanks da Jax for formatting my post...) and provoke the participant's interest and moreover the success of these kind of societies communities and group activities will depend more on the kind of participants and their interests...and thanks to ganesh for posting his first 4 lines in VVS. Yes. Nowadays ganja cud not find enough time as he has to brush all his dealer's teeths for proving CPL product's performance..ha ha. ( kidding machaan...dont take it serious and dont stop brushing your dealer's teeths...) Nothing more interesting to say now...have a nice day cares & shares Mahendran Jayavel

 Thanks, for your advanced wishes and welcome for ur expectations, S My B'day falls on Nov. 23 (sunday) and moreover my training period at Hughes, Bangalore (exactly a year & 3 days) is getting completed on Nov. 28 (friday).... Thereafter, let us c Valli whatz the spl. going to happen as part of my B'day.... Cheers

 I was in a training this forenoon... on secure coding... it was an amazing session... the trainer (one, Rangarajan from Microsoft), demonstrated how to hack... he simluated a small program in C to exploit a Buffer Overflow, which is the most frequent reason for security vulnerability in software products... I never thought hacking could be so easy.. that is, if u leave that much loopholes in ur code...

 Sindhu and Ganesh, good to have you both back. Yenda Ganesh, phone panni blog pannunnu sonna than blog pannuvaiya. Illati romba busy. Kooda supporttuku un thangachi. Sindu,"The Other Side of Midnight" is not his latest book. Look at urlLink this site for his latest books. I'll get my books when I meet him him the next time. Rajesh and Bala came home last night. Last night watched half of "The Matrix Revolutions". It was too boring. No intellectual content as the previous two movies. Yet to see the fight for Zion and Smith/Neo fight. Hope that is atleast interesting. I'm eagerly awaiting " urlLink The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King ". Hope it isn't disappointing as The Matrix Revolutions. As for books, I completed "The Covenant of the Flame" by David Morrell. David Morell was the man who wrote "First Blood" and "Rambo". "Jack: Straight from the guts" is halfway through. Today, I might start reading "Mayday" by Nelson DeMille. You can read the first chapter of the book urlLink here . Bye for now,

 Dee, enakku theriyala unga annanu, therinja naan nippataama povena. and Ganesh it was exactly me and we were going to Thirunallar only . cha missed to meet u man. sorry. i was infact seated near the window i believe. I too saw a bus borkedown, but then i was so interested in listening to the music which was running that i missed ur voice. sorry ya. i dint mean it. Had we met we could have even dropped u at the place where u were going. Cha, how i missed..... Hope not to repeat again.

 Helloooooo guys! Oru valiya yenga annan blog pannitanga...athunala yennoda virathatha ithudan mudithu kolgiren..... my pc was having fun with some virus ...so its was behaving in a crazy manner. Ranjini....yevalo thairiyam irunda u did not turn when my anna called you...iru iru unna pathukaren! I am not sure whether i fit into those voracious readers category....anyway thanx for that....the book i enjoyed the most was ' Contagion ' by Robin Cook....i have read most of Sidney Sheldon's books...looking forward to his latest ' The other side of Midnight ' - is that right Xavier.....lately started reading James Patterson's...recently read ' Silence of the Lambs ' and currently reading ' Hannibal '. BTW Xavier please collect your books from Vinod. Towards late October and early November there were fireworks all over Uk...i thought perhaps English are celebrating Diwali as well...no..it was for something they call as 'Bonfire Night'...i didnt have a clue about it.So when I asked one of my English friend, this was the reply i got... "In England, we like to be a little different from the rest of the world.Take fireworks festivals, for example. In every other country they are heldin summer. That's obviously the best time: warm weather to enjoy, and clearskies to see the fireworks.Not here. We have our Fireworks Night on 5 November, when it is damp, cold,and misty. Other countries use fireworks to celebrate success: sporting victories,musical events, weddings.Not here. We don't find success very interesting. We prefer heroic failure. Fireworks Night celebrates an attempt to blow up the Houses of Parliamentin 1605 that went wrong - the 'Gunpowder Plot'. On 5 November that year,Catholic terrorists smuggled 36 barrels of gunpowder into a cellar there.They hoped to bring down the government. However, they were caught just intime, and executed in a very slow and grisly manner. So we celebrate this day every year with fireworks. Some of us celebratethe fact that they failed. Others celebrate the fact that they nearly succeeded. Here is something else very English. Fireworks Night is also called 'GuyFawkes Night'. Guy (or Guido) Fawkes was only a minor member of theterrorist group, the man who was going to light the fuse; the leader was called Robert Catesby. But Robert Catesby is a boring name. It sounds like an estate agent or a solicitor. Guy Fawkes is an intriguing, mysterious-sounding secret agent's name, so we remember him instead. " Welcome Sri....perhaps a bit late one from me though! Mahendra...naya pathi yellam research panra pola? Hmmmmmmm Valli....India poriya???

 hi , read all the blogs after a long time. hey ranjini, i saw u last saturday near kumbakonam. u were in a yellow pattu saree and travelling in a white ambassador. i think u were going to thirunallar. i was on my way to karaikal and since my bus broke down i was standing by the road side. i called u but u did not hear me. i think u did not know that i was in kumbakonam.since i also did not check the blogs i did not know u were coming here. otherwise we could have met. then welcome home valli jax iam back bye to all

 I had a fascinating night's sleep y'day. I had 3 dreams and remember each one of them to whatever precision I looked at them while dreaming... And dreams can never get crazier than this... 1. I'm fighting in Iraq... (Don't already laugh, there's lot to go)... But not wearing the army uniform, rather normally clad. I hear gun shots all around. I could hear them so well in my dream. It seemed so realistic... this proceeds for a while, and suddenly I begin to hear bigger sounds. The enemy (whoever it was) is starting to bomb... I think to myself "I don't have bombs.. they are technologically superior.. so its only a question of time before one falls on me.." moments later I hear a huuuuge thud on the roof right over my head... and I woke up... I was still alive.... 2. Then the second spell started after I slept.. I'm inside the "Bhooth" film... Urmila is going around killing everyone... Her modus operandi is.. take a knife and rip from the right forearm to the left forearm... and people seemed to fall like nine-pins.. and no one was offering any resistance.. she just goes about killing people... One guy keeps looking at all this.. But it was not Ajay Devgan... then she comes to me... Now.. the same dialog that happens between the President and the alien in the film "Independence day" (which I saw 2 weeks back on Star Movies) takes place between me and her... I ask her "What do u want me to do.." and in the same hoarse voice as the alien in the film she says "Dieeee..!!" ... and I woke up... 2nd time lucky.. am still alive... and slept again... 3. This is the most hilarious one... I'm watching cricket match.. India are down under playing the aussies. Sachin hits an exquisite cover drive... not sure if it went for any runs.. Bill Lawry is commentating.. Yeah.. I could recognize that voice in my dream... it was so real... He says..."India are only 4 wickets down.. and they got 2 wonderful players to follow.. Dhanraj Pillay and Mohd Kaif.. its a tough time for aussies"... Yep.. u read it right... Dhanraj Pillay - the hockey player.. in the Indian cricket team.. not sure what happened afterwards, but once I woke in the morning.. there was a large smile writ all over my face - I had made Dhanraj Pillay a "wonderful cricketer".. and Bill Lawry himself acknowledged that..!! Nevertheless, It happens only in dream..!!! Just feel like analysing a bit... and examine the sequence of events over the past few days that lead to imagining the specific images of these dreams.. will post my analysis as and when I get some points... Sigmund Freud into action..!!

 Rini, I had said earlier that I am trying to update the style sheets. But I am unable to do it from office. A look at urlLink Quod scripsi, scripsi will show how blockquotes work with different style sheets. Check out all style sheets. As you might have noticed, most of the current style sheets in All in a day's work! use a white background. I use the mint stylesheet. I don't know about the style sheets the others prefer. I am working on a couple of new styles, this time with background images and different presentation layouts. I hope to have them ready by next week. One will feature the sidebar on the left, and another design will feature the sidebar on the right. I have got the basics details worked out. Still got some work to do on fonts, spacing etc. Maybe by the end of November or start of December, they will be ready. So till then, you've got to adjust with the present format.

 Valli: For a change, y dont u thittify in English ya, summa summa, tamilla thitti marthu pochunnu ninakiren, if u want i will also help u out in sifting some very special words in English, if possible, other languages too with proper translation in tamil or english. Jax: still the block quote, i dont think gives the difference i want to have, other than indenting to some extent. Ram: just kidding! anyway i dint go thru' properly as i read it in rash. but then when the blog father Jax itself is not able to get, then sorry i dont know if i will be able to analyse and tell u a soln. But still i will give a try. Rajesh: Malar thoovi varaverkapada vendiya pathangalapaathu nee bhayandhu odriye, un kaalil godrej bureau vila. ganesh and sindhu: enna annan thagachi solli vachi blog pannama irukkengala.

Appuram eppidi irukku un VVS? ippo evelavuper members aagi irukkaanga? ok guys meet u after some time

 Manny, That was an interesting article that you had posted. Sorry, that I had to format it slightly to remove extra spaces. Idhay vellaiya poochu, onnu hard diskku, illa blog posttu. Ellatheyum addikadi format panna vendiyadha irrukku. Ram, I didn't understand your case study at all. Anyone made any sense of it. Dei, I can understand Eco, but not your case study. As Kicha said, the answer is a road, actually I was thinking of a highway. I guess this weekend will be a treat weekend for those in Bangalore, Kicha and Rini completing 1 year at thier work. Ram celebrating his birthday. Enjoy it. I was planning to go to Maduraio this weekend. But as my parents are going to Hyderabad, I decided to stay at home.

 Rajesh, naan anga varumbhodhu, Tamil Dictionary la ulla ella kaetta vaarthayum oru paper la eludhi vaechittu varuvaen....unna mattum Paathaen, thitti theethiduvaen.... Yeah, I too hope to meet you all(except for Mr.Maramandai.....) Rini, I vote for a combination of Mr.or (Dr??? Is he done with his Ph.d?)S.K.Balaji & Mr.R.T.Swamy...... Both of them has to agree to some common suggestion. Would'nt that be wise? Manny, are you planning on some Ph.D program? Is that a research you have done on your area?...Anyway, that was nice man...I've read that so far.... Anna, anything spl for your B'day?

 Manny, just now after reading the blogs here went thru VVS and came back to post about the same... and 'mazed to look the same here too????????? n'way fine... What Rini, U cant get some thing from my Cases ah???? what is this.... its too bad... how come u r ... k I vote for "P. C. Sekhar" for your guidance... Then how about others, Can u get anything.. from the same... Valli, welcome back... I hope we can have atleast a chat over phone... Then Rajesh dont fly away man... I will take care of you... My sister will be so kind dont worry... can we know the solution for the puzzle, Jax!!!! Cheers

 Learning About Life from a Dog Hi bloggers, i have been reading all the posts and watching as a silent observer for the past couple of weeks as i did not get any thing to say about philosophy or literatures...may be it takes some more time for me to taste those stuff...(may be after marriage when I may need peace of mind...) and here is a piece of information that i came across while surfing the net for info on dogs...quite interesting and i hope some of u may have read this earlier...even I suppose that I have read this previously...anyhow with respect to rini's words, I want to publish something...ha ha. and thanks rini for adding me too in the list of Fortune (500) Voracious readers...see i have been reading these kind of stuffs related to dogs and all...definitely I deserve a place in this list ma...ha ha. Dogs have a natural, inborn philosophy toward the life they live. It doesn't matter where they are or who they are living with. You can learn some good attitudes to follow by observing what a dog does and enjoys. Questions you may have about this are: What can I learn from such an animal? Can this be applied to business? How does that relate to my life? 18 things to do Observing what dogs do can teaches us how we can lead a better life. The following list of 18 things dogs do--written by an unknown author--points toward attitudes to follow: Never pass the opportunity to go for a joy ride Allow the experience of fresh air and the wind in your face to be pure ecstasy. When loved ones come home, always run to greet them. When it is in your best interest, practice obedience. Let others know when they have invaded your territory. Take naps and then stretch before rising. Run, romp and play daily. Eat with gusto and enthusiasm. Be loyal. If what you find lies buried, dig until you finally get it. Never pretend to be something you're not. When someone else is having a bad day, be silent, sit close and nuzzle gently. Thrive on attention and let people touch you. Avoid biting when a simple growl will do. On hot days, drink lots of water and lie under a shade tree. When you're happy, dance around and wag your entire body. Delight in the simple joy of a long walk. No matter how often you are scolded, don't buy into the guilt and start to pout. Rather, run right back and make friends. In conclusion We would all lead happier lives if we followed these 18 principles, taken from observing the way dogs act. You must lift a leg to do things...ha ha...with Regards, Mahen

 A blockquote is a HTML tag that is used when you want to quote something, usually something that's more than a line. You can use a blockquote as described urlLink here . Yeah, the Yellow color looks great on Black, but horrible on the other backgrounds. Use blockquotes instead. It is a pity that Rajesh will be out of India during Christmas. I was planning to invite him home. Anyway maybe next year da.

 what is the use of block quote? i dont see any difference. And yellow color was looking good in black background. so i used it. let me try to use some other color hereafter.

 I went to Nithyasree's concert on Monday. That day my workload was heavy and i had to go to dance class and then have to go all the way to Chowdiah hall to attend the concert. I was exhausted. But when i stepped inside chowdiah hall where the concert took place, i just forgot everything and felt anew when i stepped out. She is very good at delivering songs in tamil than in other languages. Her pronounciation is so crystal clear and she is highly energetic too. She sang Kaatrinile varum geetham, really classic and so many other songs, never to say, throbbed me! Guys at B'lore those who get to attend any concerts at chowdiah hall, dont miss, its a beautiful auditorium, fully a/ced and the building is of the shape of violin. Looks aesthetically designed too. And it was a non ticketed event and so the crowd was heavy, but then since the hall is too big, we could see people coming after the concert had started too. Valli, welcome home after a long time! Hope to meet u, if possible! Jax, That was something big and interesting too on semiotics. I think manny is angry coz i dint list him in voracious reader's list. Sari onnaiyum sethukalampa, appo appo blog pannu enna. y rajesh threatening us? Ram, i cant get the case study........... i am going to get help from ........................ All of u please vote for the following. I can get help for the case study posted by ram from 1. Balaji sir 2. P.C. Sekar Hei vijay, how is ur job man? no blogs after the first one since u joined. Ok guys will blog later

 dear all im planning to go somewhere during last of week of decemeber or first week of january,I may not be available in India during that period and i also advice everyone to go somewhere during that period. beware and save yourself bye rajesh

 Jax, here is my guess.. ROAD The road has a white line at the center... and there are bumps too... and it cuts through the land all the way...

 hello all, Who has achieved??? why!!!!!!!!!! Who is happy??? how!!!!!!!!!! Who knows art of living??? (Not AOL of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar Guruji) I... A person has found a concept which eases the life by using the same, Awarded Nobel Prize: II... The person who has led a simple life with his / her partner by running a legal busines, the point here is he / she has taken the opportunity for parental care to the person mentioned in Case I: Enzoy Madi.... Cheers Ram

 The broken white line stretches far into the horizon. The tiny bumps reflect the bright lights. The dark swath cuts through the land with no regard for man made boundaries and at times with utter disregard to nature. Who am I?

 Nice to hear Valli is coming to India... will try to meet u during ur stay... y'day we had a party among our batchmates celebrating our anniversary.. it was good.. lots of ice creams... and everyone sharing their piece of memories from the past... some of them amazed at where they have reached while others feeling just not quite the best they could... but completing 1 year of their respective careers was always something they would cheer about all their life... and y'day they were no exception to it...

 Valli, Good to hear that you'll be returning to India soon. Hope to see you then if possible. Sri, I guess you would have to give me a double treat for 1 year and for your avartham. But before that we have Ram's birthday. That too on a Sunday, So I guess he cannot escape from giving a treat to those in Bangalore. Anyone knows where Ganesh is? I am not finding time to meet Rajesh and Bala here. Since my last post was too long, I am keeping mum today. Of course, as the final between India and Australia will begin in the afternoon, I guess that's all from me today unless...

 NOVEMBER 18, 2002: It was a warm weather in Mangalore. So I didn't care to touch the geyser.. while Dhinesh made the entire bathroom fill up with vapour... Went to have the complementary breakfast that was given everyday at the hotel.. Got to meet a few more joinees at the restaurant... with some hot bondas, idli and tea... it was a perfect breakfast for the first day... Then off we went to the bus stop with the offer letter tucked in our hand.. we knew what bus to catch.. as we had rehearsed it the previous day... We kept looking out of the window, as none of us were sure of when the stop comes... and finally got down at the right place... The security at the gate quickly glanced through the letter verified something with his list and sent us in... and there were already loads of people standing at the reception, not knowing where to turn... and we both joined the searching fun... And someone then showed us the way.. to a hall named "Nalanda". This is where most of our training classes would be held. And then, people flocked in to the hall... and took their most comfortable seats.. There was lots of murmering.. after all, we still were more of college students.. yet to come to terms with the professional realities... it was around 9AM, when finally someone wearing the ID card tag around his neck came into the room... and suddenly all noise ceased. How college like... He was the HR guy there.. and we played a little game.. for trying to know each other's names.. the icebreaker... And then, came one by one, and showed different presentations, on the company, policies.. and lots of forms to fill up... In the afternoon, the ICICI people came and opened an account for us... opening an account was never so easy an affair... We went home with a big load of forms to fill up overnight... the training, in genuine terms, was still some way from starting.. but we could already feel the ferver in the air...

 Hai all, It is nice to see Rini & Kicha celebrating their first year anniversary in their respective companies. The story of Nannum Anglerum goes like this. I joined in on 18th October, 2002.

Congrats Kicha & Rini!!....So planning to celebrate it??? See you all soon :-D)..... bye.

 Dear Rini, It is unfortunate that you could not get any snaps. But anyway a good description with photos. When you are using a short quote, use the blockquote tags. Please, you seemed to have copy-pasted the short poem, it appears in bright yellow color, which is not nice at all with the white backgrounds. So I have changed it into a blockquote. Check the source code or click on edit within blogger to see how to put up blockquotes. Regarding semiotics, I am preparing a rough guide on semiotics. Here is a short culling from my notes. Semiotics can be roughly defined as the study of signs. Semiotics comes from the Greek word, semeîon, meaning 'sign'. Semiotics involves the study not only of what we refer to as 'signs' in everyday speech, but of anything which 'stands for' something else. In a semiotic sense, signs take the form of words, images, sounds, gestures and objects. Semiotics is concerned with everything that can be taken as a sign. In simple terms... For example, the word, ' Open ' , when you encounter it on a shop entrance, you come to know that the shop is open and you can go inside to purchase something. The same word, when seen on a button within a lift, lets you know that the lift will open when you press the button. You may also see the word on a cardboard box top, specifying the direction in which the box is to be opened. What did you do now? You encountered a single word, yet the same word prompted you to perform different actions. The study of how a sign, in this case the word ' Open ', could take on different meanings to different situations is called semiotics. It is the study of how signs take on thier meaning with respect to their context and surroundings. I could probably give lots of similar examples on how images or sounds, even gestures and objects could have different meanings in different contexts. You might have remembered a similar examples in our Marketing class about cultural differences or linguistical differences a brand can have. On Eco, I don't think that he is too hard to understand. In the excerpt that I had given, the third para speaks about simple maths and the value of pi. Remember no one has still understood how all circular objects are united by this seemingly simple, but complex number. The fourth para speaks on physics and the properties of the pendulum. The fifth one is really a tough one. It contains references to both mythology and geography. I had to read the para more than a couple of times to understand it. One interesting coincidence was that I had thought that Novaya Zemlaya was a mythological place, since I had never heard about it. The next day, I had gone to client's place. At the GM's office, I saw a huge map of the world. While waiting for the client to complete a call, I was looking at the map. I was trying to see if I could locate the places I had read the previous day. And to my surprise, I located Novaya Zemlaya. It is in Russia, very near to the North Pole. Back at the office, I searched for about it to see why it was mentioned. Amazing facts surfaced. For people to go to the Pacific Ocean from the Atlantic Ocean (Europe was located in the northern postion of the Atlantic Ocean) entitled a long and dangerous journey around South America, if you can recall our high school geography. So seamen tried to find ways (north-east and north-west). The North Western passage would go through the North west Atlantic ocean and join the Pacific Ocean at the Bering Straits between Siberian Russia and Alaska. The North Eastern passage passed through the island of Novaya Zemlaya. While a few were successful in finding a path through the Northwest passage, many lost thier lives navigating the northeast passage. This was before aeroplanes came into existence and the railways were in thier infancy. Later on, the railroads across America paved the way for the country to become an advanced industrial nation it is today. Interesting to know how just a small passage can help you understand geography and history a lot. That is one thing I liked about his book. Each page and paragraph was so full of information that Antony Burgess, another great writer, said that."This book needs an index." Interestingly, Avalon mentioned in the excerpt is a mythological place in British myths. Microsoft has chosen the name as a codename for thier user interface in thier upcoming Windows OS Longhorn. Rini, the first page of the book starts with this quote. Only for you, children of doctrine and learning, have we written this work. Examine this book, ponder the meaning we have dispersed in various places and gathered again; what we have concealed in one place we have disclosed in another, that it may be understood by your wisdom - Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim, De occulta philosophia, 3, 65 In case you are interested in reading this book, I have an electronic version of the book as a text file. If required, I can send it to you. It comes around 1 MB. That's all for today,

 Hi everybody, ya it will b the first anniversary for me here in US&S. And ya jax, i had a slight hint, that it might be a prediction from any one of the astro site. But couldnt think, since it look so personalised. any way good prediction man. Closely matches u. Valli kolanthai, odambai bathrama paarthukko da. sorry jax, Umberto Eco seems to be difficult for me. Ofcourse i think reading such paras will really be like reading a book in a language which u know least and trying to understand it with the help of a dictionary/encyclopedia. Onakku purinja, engalukkum sollu so that we will also know some thing different like Arcane mythology. And rather than providing links for all the search results on semiotics, it would be better if u urself give us a simple definition, so that it will help us understand better, rather than going to all the sites and letting us know. Hei today evening i am planning to go to Nithyasree Mahadevan's concert. Hope to have a ncie time.

 i had been to almost all the Navagraha temples in and around Kumbakonam. It was nice to see all those temples in a leisurely manner. My parents, my sis and we both went in a car from Kumbakonam. So we had a pleasant journey and the climate was also very good. First day, it was raining but still so enjoyable and the second day, it was sunny, but not scorching. And in all temples we had a heartful dharshan. It was a satisfying trip for us. Especially we went to urlLink Airadeeswarar temple in Tarasuram. U cant just imagine the richness our ancestors have showered in the form of sculpture there. Simply beautiful u know. Full of urlLink pillars high in beautifully carved dance postures, fighting postures, all great saints, lords, and there were some very good sculpture which i think are worth sharing with u people. There was one sculpture, where in there is a head of a women and four bodies, which are sculpted in such a way that which so ever way u look, the head is attached to any one of the body. Really so nice. One more sculpture namely urlLink Gajasamhara murthy in Tamil, shows that Lord shiva is coming out from the inside of an Elephant. There are similar kind of sculptures found in Belur Temple and in Meenakshi amman temple too. The one which i have provided here as link is the one found in Belur. But the one which i found in Tarasuram was the most beautiful of all the three. I am sorry since i dint take snaps, i couldnt provide u one found at Tarasuram. It so gracefully shows how Lord Shiva tears out of the stomach of a mighty elephant like that of a tearing a Banana leaf and stepping on the head of that monstrous thing as stepping out of the bed (sombal murikira maathiri kai vachirukkar) It was really a thing to watch.Expressions on the face was infinite! To end this blog, here are some mystic lines which held me most! Overpassing lines that please the outward eyes But hide the sight of that which lives within Sculpture and painting concentrated sense Upon an inner vision's motionless verge, Revealed a figure of the invisible, Unveiled all Nature's meaning in a form, Or caught into a body the Divine.

 Rini, I guess your short trip to Thanjai and Kudandhai went off well. So, are you and Kicha planning to celebrate your respective first anniversaries at work? Hope your curiosity on who wrote "My Identity" was satisfied. Manny, Sorry da, didn't get the mood to post anything on VVS. This week surely, there will be a few postings from me. Started reading " urlLink Jack: Straight from the Gut " by Jack Welch, ex-CEO, General Electric. Got the book from Sri. Guys, anyone planning to go to "Jay Jay". My advice: Don't. I learnt a lesson the hard way on Friday. First day, last show. The previous Tamil film I had seen in a theatre was "Rojakootam". After that, this one. No more watching tamil films in theatre here onwards. If it was a fifty rupees note in Rojakootam, this film features a hundred rupees note. I guess the next film that "Oscar" Ravichandran produces will feature a five-hundred or a thousand rupees note. The film is a total waste of time and money. And to think I skipped dinner to go to the movie makes me feel ..... The film is a straight copy from "Serendipity", shown on Zee MGM last month. The funny thing is that Nov. 7 saw the release of "Unnai Partha Naal Mudhal", Nov. 14 - "Jay Jay" and Nov. 21, "Ennaku 20, Unnaku 18" will be released. All three movies have been copied from "Serendipity". If you think, you can watch the movie for Madhavan, it is a total waste of his talents. If you think you can watch the movie for the heroines, forget it. The music by Bharadwaj gets irritating after a couple of times. Location-wise, Kolkatta and Greece provide some succour. There is no comedy at all. Villains are totally pathetic and cliched. If you have any hard feelings towards anyone, get them a ticket to this film and your revenge will never be such sweet.

 Hi everyone, Kicha and Rini, congratulations on completing one year at your concerns. Valli, It's good to have you back. No news from Sindhu. Any calls or mails from her. Yahoo Groups seems to be accessible again. I don't know how long it will be before it is banned again. Rini, you had asked me about my favourite authors. The truth is I have no favorite authors. There are several things that I like in different authors. For example: Frederick Forysth has the knack of keeping you on the edge of your seat through his prose; Wilbur Smith explains the richness and beauty of Africa through his works and Jeffrey Archer provides the most insane twists in the tale that you kick yourself for have not seeing it earlier itself. Ken Follet 's stories are so thrilling and captivating that you want to read them again and again. Tom Clancy provides so much accurate information on military hardware that you become an expert on the subject. David Morrell writes about the strength of human spirit. Jonathan Black provides an insider's view on the power struggles and behind-the-scenes of the rich and powerful people and corporations. Michael Crichton blends technology and fiction that you are left wondering what is not possible by man. Colin Forbes and Craig Thomas provide interesting information about the British Secret Service and its part in the world stage through their works. Umberto Eco stitches different subjects to provide hours of excitement and discoveries. Different writers have different styles. So it is really difficult to pick any one. Even one-off writers like Bill Gates and Jack Welch have imbibed thier books with thier unique styles that at the end of the book, you feel like understood them. I like books that make me feel that I have lost a great friend when I complete it. Anyone writing such a book will be my favourite. Bye for now,

 Hi, I'm completing 1 year of my career tomorrow.. and so is Ranjini... if u r not aware.. me and ranjini started our careers on the same day - Nov 18 - last year... so, here's a piece of my nastalgia... NOVEMBER 16, 2002: I started from my home early in the morning and boarded the bus to Thiruppur.. to Bala's house... I had to catch West Coast Express to Mangalore that evening from coimbatore... after lunch we started to coimbatore.. Bala had some meeting in office... I put my luggage in cloak room and went for browsing.. chatted with vijay babu... then around evening.. sriprasath, bala, jax and ajayan were at the station... lots of talk about that Sri's famous letter to Rajkumar of Edge.. and amid a lot of hullabullo and noise and fun, I boarded the train... NOVEMBER 17, 2002: Reached Mangalore early morning at 5.30 ... and my eyes fell on someone whose face seemed familiar to me.. and it didn't take much time to realise who was walking past me.. it was Kadri Gopalnath.. the saxophone maestro... then, called up home and informed of my safe arrival and went out looking for an auto... Met the guy (Dhinesh) who would be my roommate, in the auto... incidentally he was also from Madurai (near arappalayam)... and we went to our hotel.. a 3-star one... and admiring and enjoying the luxury that had befallen us... after some chatting and breakfast.. both of us fell asleep... Dhinesh woke me up around 1.30PM for lunch... had a lousy lunch in a hotel... something that still makes us laugh our hearts out... We were curious to see the campus.. so enquired how to reach there and went to the campus... It was a very small one compared to Chennai .. but was looking very good, nevertheless... Came back from there.. and there was a big marketplace adjacent to our hotel... we went walking for a coupla hours around that place.. he got a earphone for his walkman.. and I got "Kaadhal virus" cassette... and came back to the room... got to meet some other joinees who were staying in the hotel... and slept for the day with lots of anxiety on how the next day - the first day of our career would turn out...

 Hi...after quiet a long time. Early last week, i was not feeling well.....Didn't go to college & work for a couple of days...& now i'm running behing all my schedules...... Although I keep reading all the blogs daily, I really don't know, what to talk about today....So many issues, going around, i guess.....I might have to sit down & read them all, one more time, before i can post my views.....I hope i'll do that.... Had a chat with Kicha last week, & so I remember this one isuue very well....posted by Kicha.....Female Identity & words like "for men, their work is the life's purpose.. while for the women servicing their hubby is the life's purpose..." & Horoscope..... About the saying above, I don't think 'servicing' is a right word there......Sure i'll always put my family first, not my career...I do that because I love my husband & in the future I want my kids to get the best care..... My opinion on this would be, I do agree with the point that, Family is very very important for a woman....But it does not take her entire time & brains to do that..... Though life might be quiet busy, turning back after years, we might get the eternal satisfaction that i've satisfied both my family & me..... & about the horoscopes....I'm really confused myself.....Why is the divorce rate so low in arranged marriages? Horoscope is a science, It's not a myth.....i know just that much.....Maybe, I too need more inputs on this issue.....Would like to hear from you guys..... Ok time for my class.....going now.... bye

 Amazed by the topic... Visit... urlLink Easy_Porting Rini,,, Dont, take me into voracious reader categories... Although I read quite often, it will be of my taste & kind only... like personality books, mental dynamics, health issues, autobiographies... and mostly tech books.. only... Yeah philosphical like upanishads, astrology, astronomy, numerology, palmistry, sun / moon signs, body language... etc books do I have, but not reading them as often as above... Regarding a review about ur topic.. its nice... and I liked the definitions by vivekanada & aurbindo... sorry quite indulged with some other matters...... these days.... will be free in a month or so.... Cheers

 Ranjini, as you had said, it is his words that are interesting. Umberto Eco, in my opinion, is one great writer. He is a professor of semiotics at the University of Bologna, Italy. His works are absolutely brilliant. You can read a short biography urlLink here . Eco does not write. He instead constructs sentences. Sentences enhanced by the architecture of semiotics. To understand his works, you need to have a through understanding of subjects ranging from arcane mythology to simple logic. The best way to read one of his books, especially his The Name of the Rose and Foucault's Pendulum , is to have an entire library at their disposal for reference. If some one says to me, they read a lot of books, I ask them, "Can you tell me if you have read Foucault's Pendulum?" That's it. That one book is equivalent to reading several books on a wide range of subjects. For example, I am reproducing the first 5 paragraphs of Foucault's Pendulum below. Read it and tell me your thoughts on it. That was when I saw the Pendulum. The sphere, hanging from a long wire set into the ceiling of the choir, swayed back and forth with isochronal majesty. I knew—but anyone could have sensed it in the magic of that serene breathing—that the period was governed by the square root of the length of the wire and by &Pi;, that number which, however irrational to sublunar minds, through a higher rationality binds the circumference and diameter of all possible circles. The time it took the sphere to swing from end to end was determined by an arcane conspiracy between the most timeless of measures: the singularity of the point of suspension, the duality of the plane’s dimensions, the triadic beginning of &pi;, the secret quadratic nature of the root, and the unnumbered perfection of the circle itself. I also knew that a magnetic device centered in the floor beneath issued its command to a cylinder hidden in the heart of the sphere, thus assuring continual motion. This device, far from interfering with the law of the Pendulum, in fact permitted its manifestation, for in a vacuum any object hanging from a weightless and unstretchable wire free of air resistance and friction will oscillate for eternity. The copper sphere gave off pale, shifting glints as it was struck by the last rays of the sun that came through the great stained-glass windows. Were its tip to graze, as it had in the past, a layer of damp sand spread on the floor of the choir, each swing would make a light furrow, and the furrows, changing direction imperceptibly, would widen to form a breach, a groove with radial symmetry—like the outline of a mandala or pentaculum, a star, a mystic rose. No, more a tale recorded on an expanse of desert, in tracks left by countless caravans of nomads, a story of slow, millennial migrations, like those of the people of Atlantis when they left the continent of Mu and roamed, stubbornly, compactly, from Tasmania to Greenland, from Capricorn to Cancer, from Prince Edward Island to the Svalbards. The tip retraced, narrated anew in compressed time what they had done between one ice age and another, and perhaps were doing still, those couriers of die Masters. Perhaps the tip grazed Agarttha, the center of the world, as it journeyed from Samoa to Novaya Zemlya. And I sensed that a single pattern united Avalon, beyond the north wind, to the southern desert where lies the enigma of Ayers Rock. Since you have got me interested in Eco, I will be posting more on him later. Maybe after you come back from your tour. Take pictures and put them online. Have a wonderful weeekend. Others, see you tomorrow!

 I could see that half of the books in ur Wish list had Umberto Eco as the author. Whats so interesting in his words? And ya friends i want to know who are ur favourite writers and what are ur favourite books. Voracious readers like Jax, Sindhu, Valli, Kicha, Ram can post some reviews of their own on what they read recently on blog na. All r busy with tight schedules i believe. Btw, i am going for a two day pilgrimage tour to Tanjore and Kumbakonam. I will be back on monday. Those are places rich in temples in and around the city. i think we will have a nice time, visiting and imbibing some beautiful sculptures in us. bye for now!

 Hi, The urlLink final chapter of My Identity was put up today morning. Unlike an exercise in egotism, it was really helpful in understanding a little bit about myself. Though I am not sure how of it is correct and how much it isn't. I really liked a few portions of the chapters. There were a couple of inconsistencies also at times. I guess I have the rest of the month to sift through them and understand myself better. BTW, any guesses on the origin of the report. Kicha, I'll check things out at my end (mail not being received). I had read a similar article a long time ago. It was more or less the same (I don't know it it is the same, cause the dates differ). I don't feel anything taboo about it. The article was clear and spoke about reality as it is. The more things are spoken about, more everyome gets to understand them. For example recently, Vijay had posted a mail that he received about being infected in public place with the Aids virii. People, unaware of the fact that the Aids virus cannot survive outside the human body very long, get tense and stressed. The reason is they are not properly educated on the Aids virus or on how it spreads. Likewise your article. I was sick yesterday. Didn't come to office. And God, how boring it is to sit at home doing nothing, no TV, no computer, no books to read. Seems the blog is becoming more philosophical nowadays. Two posts on Philosophy. Kicha's post, I got it as a forward some time ago. I don't know if it was from msitmmb or any other group. It was a stark representation of what we are today. Incidentally, from the posts during the past couple of weeks, more posts have been about questioning everyone's inner self through literature, philosophy and personal. It is good to hear that we also get to speak about quite a lot of thoughts and belief structures from everyone. Hope it continues in the future. Bye for now,

 GEORGE CARLIN (post 9-11... his wife recently died...) (mouthy comedian of the 70's and 80's) The paradox of our time in history is that we have taller buildings but shorter tempers, wider freeways, but narrower viewpoints. We spend more, but have less, we buy more, but enjoy less. We have bigger houses and smaller families, more conveniences, but less time. We have more degrees but less sense, more knowledge, but less judgment, more experts, yet more problems, more medicine, but less wellness. We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh too little, drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too late, get up too tired, read too little, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom. We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values. We talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too often. We've learned how to make a living, but not a life. We've added years to life not life to years. We've been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing the street to meet a new neighbor. We conquered outer space but not inner space. We've done larger things, but not better things. We've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul. We've conquered the atom, but not our prejudice. We write more, but learn less. We plan more, but accomplish less. We've learned to rush, but not to wait. We build more computers to hold more information, to produce more copies than ever, but we communicate less and less. These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion, big men and small character, steep profits and shallow relationships. These are the days of two incomes but more divorce, fancier houses, but broken homes. These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway morality, one night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do everything from cheer, to quiet, to kill. It is a time when there is much in the showroom window and nothing in the stockroom. A time when technology can bring this letter to you, and a time when you can choose either to share this insight, or to just hit delete. Remember, spend some time with your loved ones, because they are not going to be around forever. Remember, say a kind word to someone who looks up to you in awe, because that little person soon will grow up and leave your side. Remember, to give a warm hug to the one next to you, because that is the only treasure you can give with your heart and it doesn't cost a cent. Remember, to say, "I love you" to your partner and your loved ones, but most of all mean it. A kiss and an embrace will mend hurt when it comes from deep inside of you. Remember to hold hands and cherish the moment for someday that person will not be there again. Give time to love, give time to speak, and give time to share the precious thoughts in your mind. Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away.

 Friends, we all would have heard of Upanishads and vedas, but how upanishads sprung after vedic age and what it speaks about is so beautifully explained in the following article. ************************************************************* The symbolism used in the Rig Veda prevented the deep knowledge of Veda Samhitas from becoming widespread and the age of Rig Veda came to an end. Much later attempts were made to recover the knowledge of the Vedas and this lead to the emergence of the Upanishads.The Upanishads were discovered by personages called rishis or the seers (of thought). These spiritual principles were not created but discovered by the rishis. These truths are the utterances of the sages on the basis of their illumined experience. These illumined experiences of the sages were not ordinary perceptions, inference or reflections, but experiences of an independent reality which impinge on their consciousness. Sri Aurobindo states: The rishis of the Upanishads sought to recover the lost or waning knowledge of the Veda by meditation and spiritual experience and they used the text of the ancient Mantras as a prop and authority for their own intuitions and perception or else the Vedic word was a seed of thought and vision by which they recovered old truths in new forms. What they found, they expressed in other terms more intelligible to the age in which they lived. It is because the seers of the Upanishads reveal to us their pictures of the splendours of the unseen, that we are inspired to rise above the attractions and distractions of the materialistic life. These Upanishads have inspired generations of Indians with vision and strength by their spiritual power and their life-giving message. Swami Vivekananda declared: Strength, strength is what the Upanishads speak to me from every page. This is the one great thing to remember, it has been the one great lesson I have been taught in my life. Strength, it says, strength O man, be not weak. Are there no human weaknesses? Asks man. There are, says the Upanishads, but would more weakness heal them? Would you try to wash dirt with dirt? Will sin cure sin, weakness cure weakness? Ay, it is the only literature in the world where you find the word Abhih , fearless, used again and again. In no other scripture in the world is this adjective applied either to God or man. And the Upanishads are the great mine of strength. Therein lies the strength enough to invigorate the whole world. The whole world can be vivified, made strong, energized through them. They will call with trumpet voice upon the weak, the miserable, and the downtrodden of all races, all creeds, all sects, to stand on their feet and be free. Freedom - physical freedom, mental freedom, and spiritual freedom are the watchwords of the Upanishads.

 Have u seen this before... I happened to stumble on this thing. With so much literary ferver around, this might interest all of u... Take a look at what urlLink Project Gutenberg is all about...

 I'm sending the Thought for the day and joke everyday... and ram, rini, kavi seem to be receiving it regularly... might be some trouble with ur angler ID.. check that...

 Jax, Actually I have posted 2 mesgs newly.... But I couldnt publish the same in web... it throws out nothing published this time, for the past 1 week... I fed up... and didnt updated later also... will have to debug... provide any suggestions if possible.... Cheers Ram

 urlLink This uses technology 2 help mankind

 Thanks Ram, I thought the page would have been corrected long ago. But now I find it has not been. I wonder how I didn't notice it this morning also. Well as you said, that's life. This shows how you cannot expect everyone to do things perfectly. At times, you've got to set things alright by yourself. I was expecting a few posts on your Thoughts and kept checking it twice a day, but it wasn't. When will it be updated, da? Kicha seems to have turned quite philosophical during the past few days. No Thought for the day or jokes from him. It is just a passing phase in everyone's lifetime. And it is also good for the mind. Hoping to hear a lot from you soon. BTW, anyone gone to view the match today? Busy keeping an eye on the scorecard now. Bye.

 ram, I can't figure out what error u r trying to point.. can u elaborate... And these days, there's a lot of literary flavour in our blog. I'm doing some reading too... but those are predominantly satirical in nature... not stories or fiction or poems but articles/write-ups ranging from comments on the bygone days to certain issues/topics of my personal interest... they are certainly helping me look at things with a "different" perspective... a down-to-earth understanding of things which are so obvious yet difficult to comprehend. This certainly is a unique experience am undergoing... and my interest towards such reading is only increasing as I read more of them... hope to share a few things with u too...

 Dear Rini, Yeah, Rini, I went through the poem that day itself and like you, I have been trying to understand the poem. I took down a few notes for posting later. Since you were also searching, I am posting it now. I would say that, based on my experiences, The Waste Land is the poetic equivalent of Eco's Foucault's Pendulum . As a poem, it references a wide range of works spread across varying subjects from philosophy to mythology. It is an excellent example in semiotics. The basic method used in The Waste Land may be described as the application of the principle of complexity. The poet works in terms of surface parallelisms which in reality make ironical contrasts, and in terms of surface contrasts which in reality constitute parallelisms. - urlLink Cleanth Brooks Since you wanted a paraphase to the poem, urlLink here is the site I was referring to when reading the poem. As said earlier, I was reading a lot about semiotics the day you posted the link to the poem. Was it a coincidence that the poem was a real life example of semiotics. I don't know. If you are wondering what semiotics means, here is a list of definitions from urlLink Google . urlLink T.S. Eliot was called one of the great poets of the 20 th century. I hope you remember the following part of a poem of his. We shall not cease from exploration And the end of all our exploring Will be to arrive where we started And know the place for the first time. He wrote an entire book about cats. The poem was modified into a musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber and it became a wonderful success. Recently, it was shown in TV.

 hi all, quite busy and highly deciding over some matter for the past couple of weeks... but keeping me updated with other blog matters... will catch up to your speed soon... Rini, Sorry I havent send u the photos yet... k valli / jax.. le'me upload in yahoo photos and send the link itself... nothing more, will update u with special matters whenever it comes.. Cheers

 Hei can u get something out of it? coz i heard that Eliot himself had to write some notes for his poem when he wrote the next version. Its language is simple but embedded with lines from German, might b french or latin and even Sanskrit too. He seems to be Erudite scholar. And without any paprphrase its really really tough to understand him i believe. Anyway i am making attempts to further bury down to the meaning behind those mystic lines! Oh atlast tomorrow its going to end and i havent read other chapters for the past few days. Will have a look or read and then post my comments there! Kaanavillai: Valli&Sindhu. y what happened? bye for now

 Hi everyone, For the past couple of days, I've been unable to participate much. Don't know if the situation may extend today also. I hope everyone remebers Venn Diagrams. Here is a small list of its practical urlLink uses . We have used it in Angler to explain our company in a better manner. You can see it urlLink here and urlLink here . My Identity has reached its urlLink ninth installment. Tommorow, I'll be posting the final installment. Kicha, you can mail the article. Don't send the link as I may not be able to access it. Hey, it's been a long time since we heard from Sindhu. Seems to be enjoying an extended vacation at home. And Valli also, are you caught up in your course work. I am yet to receive my MCJ materials. Seems like I might receive it just in time for my exams. I wonder when they might be. BTW , I have been given an additional designation at Angler, Project Co-ordinator in addition to my previous designation of Content Developer .

 jax, Your point is true. But the fact of the matter is that, there are issues which are delicate enough to be addressed like other normal issues (in an "Indian" sense). If u r interested I'll send the link to that article to ur postmark ID. Its available in their website as well... I have quite a lot of things to say about all that is in that article. You read that and tell if I can post everything I feel about it in this blog. You'll understand, that will not be possible...!!!

 As my net connection was down yesterday, I was unable to particiapte or post anything. Rini, read your comments, I have posted mine too. Read them and reply there itself. Kicha, I don't think that anything is taboo in the modern day. The more people understand things, the more mature they become. If we are bound by things that are not to be spoken off, those things have no reason for existing at all. More later.

 to jax, ok da. i ll do according u said. Pitha Magan i do agree what sri told. everyone acted very well. as sri told, if u take scene by scene, that movie is really superb, in each scene everyone acted very well. if one scene vikram acted very well then in the next scene sivamainthan overtook him and at the end of that scene laila come and make her mark. so if u consider the entire film as scene by scene, sure everyone ll like it. this movie will score high marks, if it is shown in SunTV super scenes. by this time everyone could understand what i m trying to say. yes it is. if u see it as a entire movie, then from the next time u wont go for anyother Bala's movie. Psycho paiyan, kevalama padam pannirukkan. i went to this movie on the very next day of deepavali with my sivakasi gang. this is not only our comments, this was the comment by most of the people who saw with us. everyone murmured only like that. bcos i took my bike out of the theatre and waited for one of my friend in the roadside, one family came out of the theatre also stand nearer to me and waited for someone. everyone in that family gave similar comment like what i told, then my friend arrived there and told "dei machan oruthan intha padam supernnu solranda". then uncle(head of the nearby standing family) told "yaaruppa appadi solrathu, antha punniavanna konjam parkanumnnu sonnaru". bala took this movie for only the five or six persons whom sri mentioned. he gave them a very good chance to act and they too did well. but if u ask what is the story??????? nothing is there? its very boring? and u cant imagine a girl like laila from a village. family girls can be bold, but they should not fight with rowdies in the road. reg. vikram character - u can not imagine a person like him in the real life. bcos he was not born and brougt up in forest, but he behave like that. i can appreciate only one thing, that is surya's acting and characterisation, both are good. apart from that nothing is there in the film. this is only my view, but u can consider this b4 going to that movie. but my friend in chennai told that Pithamagan is a box office hit. so it seems more people hav Bala's view, if suppose u have Babu's(hihihiiii myself) view then dont go to that film.

 Yesterday I saw Pithamagan directed by Bala. Really superb movie. Vickram, Suriya, Laila, Sangeetha(Rasika) lived as the concerned characters of Sittan, Sakthivel, Manju, Gomathi. Suriya's comedy are reality fantastic. Vickram does not have a dialogue to speak. I did not see these sort of acting from Laila in her previous movies. Manobala and Karuna's comedy superb. Illayaraja has composed heart throbbing music and background Score. Each and every credit goes to Bala only. "Don't fail to see Pithamagan once"

 Got to read an interesting article in y'day's Times of India. But it feels sad, that I will not be able to share my views on the article nor give a link to that article. The reason is... that article is written about a societal taboo...!!! something which has a negative halo attached to its head... and I'm not sure how many would really see the other side of things. I do wonder why some things are considered to be such "bad" to even talk about, while they are nothing but a component of life... In the recent times, things have changed a bit.. but such things are still looked upon with "disgust" and "fear" ...

 I was surfing the net to get some articles about some geniuses. My Brain lamp lit up and I searched about Thomas Alva Edison and about his urlLink inventions I hope you read "Alice in Wonderland" in your schoolteacher. But I thought about Lewis Carroll. I am surprised to see that he was a great Mathematician as well urlLink Caroll Everyone likes Donald Duck, Mickey Mouse isn't it? I thought about Walt Disney and his family urlLink Disney I love A.R.Rahman Music. I heard "Ennaku 20 Unnaku 18 "Songs. Splendid, Superb are the two words to comment on that. He currently orchestrated for a Chinese film too. To see more on this urlLink Rahman

 Jax ur id: xavierroy@postmark.net is that right...? tell me...i have sent the invi...but if still u did not receive that....oops! may be the blog father has to see to it Mahen

 Wish you all a very Happy New Year! With Wishes, Kavitha

 Dear Friends, First of all my best wishes to u all for a prosperous New year 2004. Friends, I welcome all of ur decision to arrange for a get together in Madurai. The problem for me is, I have been told that the Gettogether will held in Coimbatore. But, now I have been told it will be held in Madurai. Friends, I was on my way to Madurai yesterday(30/12/2003) and I could not go through the blog. Due to this get together, I have also cancelled my personal trip with my mother to Sivakasi on the same day(25/1/2004). I was not given a fair chance not only in this situation, but in all the aspects of the blog. I was always seen as Hobson's choice in the blog proceedings. I am sorry to say all this, but it is the fact. I predict the decision making in the group is fully centralized and I had not given a fair chance too. So I voluntarily took a decision to quit from this group. "Wish U all again Happy and Prosperous New Year 2004" I wish all the bloggers in this group all success in all their endeavours.



 A good try, Manny. I expected this answer. But is it the right answer? There were a lot of questions that are hidden within the sentence. The first sentence reads, " Five frogs are sitting on a log. " Ok, this is a simple fact. The second statement, " Four decide to jump off. " is an ambigious statement. Are the four mentioned in the statement, a part of the five already present on the log. Or maybe there are four frogs that are ready to jump off some other log on to this log? You can never know. The same logic applies to the third statement," How many are left? " The riddle, split up into individual sentences, makes logical sense but it does not provide any meaning. This was just a simple exercise in semantics. The phenomenon is known as intertextuality. Intertextuality, as defined by Michael Riffaterre, "depends on [a system of] limitations in our freedom of choice, of exclusions, since it is by renouncing incompatible associations within the text that we come to identify in the intertext their compatible counterparts." Those of you who are still puzzling on what the last paragraph meant, relax. I'll provide examples after the New Year. Till then send your thoughts on how the blog looks now. It is still a work under progress. It will be gradually improved in the days to come.

 There will be five frogs left still... They have decided to jump off and they have not jumped off still. So five frogs left. ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha...ithu epdi irukku?

 Five frogs are sitting on a log. Four decide to jump off. How many are left? Answer will be posted tomorrow.

 seems a good idea. awaitng comments

 Considering the views of a lot of people, it seems to be more wise to have the get-together in MADURAI on 25th... Do let me know if there are any issues about this.. Most girls can make it.. and arrangements can be made for guys.. what we are going to do there is entirely up to us... Please let me know ur confirmation... so that arrangements can be made...

 I have believed in them and probably never will. I have posted a few articles on urlLink Quod scripsi, scripsi as promised. Maybe, my new year resolution will be blog at least once a day.

 Kicha, you had told a few points that I wanted to convey. But I wouldn't say that my year wasn't dramatic. It was largely uneventful, but a few incidents have really touched my heart. The year began with suffering for me. I had a bout of severe cold, coupled with wheezing. To add to the mix, I was supposed to sing in the midnight mass at church. I decided to endure it through. Somehow managed to get through the first day of the year sans complications. A few major incidents that taught me about life were the Gujarat riots, Cricket World Cup and Invasion of Iraq. Each of this incident taught me a different outlook on life. The Gujarat Riots taught me about preciousness of human life. urlLink This photo is a stark reminder of its preciousness. I am not blaming anyone here but the riots are a blemish to Indian secularism. The unacceptable fact is that the perpetuators of the horrifying incidents during the dark days of the riots were people like you and me. They were not terrorists who were trained by a foreign power. They were just ordinary common people like you and me. This is what frightens me. A terrorist is a person who believes in some ideological doctrines (whether it is right or worng is another matter). Thier policy of terrorism is summed by Lenin's words,"The purpose of terrorism is to terrorize." Simple and crisp. It is easy to understand them. But violence by ordinary people is unacceptable. Amidst all this, India's performance in the world cup gave me great joy. Though we were beaten by Australia, I can feel proud that it took the best team in the world to beat us. Australia's performance was as expected. I think the last year has been really good for India in the sports arena, in hockey, chess, tennis, athletics... I believe this blog also took shape during the fag days of February amidst the riots and cricket. Though a few came to know of it by the begining of March, the blog was in its incubation much earlier than that. It has provided to be a wise investment in terms of time. I guess everyone would agree to that. The invasion of Iraq by the US and its allies was another major incident. I feel it is just an act of desperation by the US. A classic case of high school bullyism by Bush. Fortunately it did not escalate into a major war. I had mae by views on the war in several of my earlier posts. So I need not reiterate all those once more. Other than the above mentioned incidents, there were several other small incidents that had shaped my life in 2003. I may be posting them here or in Quod scripsi, scripsi later. Sri had asked last week on how the past year has been, personally and professionally. I guess this answers a few aspects of the past year. Professionally, I can't say much. Maybe, you can read it in Quod scripsi, scripsi later on. I think plans for the new year warrants another post, which will be posted later.

 Am writing this trilogy of sorts.. my views about myself in the past year and going forward.. the first one is "The year that was" for the past year... this would be followed by two more... about the present and one about the future... ----------- As I look upon the last 48 hrs of this year... I'm overcome by a strange avalanche of mixed feelings.. its been a year sans anything dramatic.. most of that is to do with my lazy attitude about going about my life and living.. which seems to take new turns every now and then... This year saw some relationships become hazy and some new ones that seem more precious than anything... I got to know new people and understood some people better... and felt for doing so at times... Ignorance sure is bliss..!! This year did teach me some new lessons on how to cope with life... and why one should not be as lazy as me... My career has steadied myself and channelled my plans and thinking to a very significant extent... I can call myself a "fresher" no more... feels happy to know I've grown up.. but that also means increased responsibilities... somtimes I wonder why do we ever grow up.. why can't we always be the cute little kids for our parents... and such childish wishes still continue.. there is still a lot of child in me... But that has not deterred my "futuristic" thinking... I feel I have grown stronger.. but yet to have enough tests to validate that... a bit of arrogance has also creeped slowly in... I try to use this as positive as possible though... but, after all, I'm just a human being... I become too much of a future planner at times... and try to make unnecessary "sacrifices"... may be because, I'm still learning to distiguish between some of my wants and needs... Its been just another year in my life... the first one that I spent as a "working lad" in its entirety... with most of my time devoted to "learning the trade"...

 All those who had conveyed their wishes for Christmas through the blog / mail / directly, I would like to say, Thank You. I have a lot of things to discuss with all in the week to come. Till then, Bye.

 Travelling has always fascinated me. Being surrounded by people gives me a lot of opportunities to watch them, learn about them. Spending quite some time with your fellow passengers can be irritating as well as interesting. Your co-passengers fellow passengers can make or break your journey. My journey to Madurai was uneventful. On getting into the bus, I saw one of my sanguinal cousins in the bus. Ok, I have company. He said he was going home. OK, I thought, atleast I have his company for three-quarters of the way. I was wrong. He went off to sleep immediately as we crossed the city limits. The in-bus movie was horrible. I had seen it earlier. So I decided to rest. But the noise from the movie was too loud. Finally after a four and half hours and two movies later, I reached Madurai. Reaching home, I found that everyone had left for the midnight mass. I decided to go to the mass, but it was halfway though. I could hear the clear voice of the priest reach my ears. Sitting down on the steps awaiting the arrival of relatives, I had a few mosquitoes for company. An hour and a half later, they arrived. The next few hours were spent in exchange of pleasantries and information. Morning saw me get up and go to Christmas Mass. Came home to have Breakfast. Everyone decided to watch a movie. Watched a typical masala film, 'Winner'. By the time, the movie was over, lunch was ready. A heavy lunch followed up by another movie, "Allaudin" saw me get to late evening. Nephews wanted to burst crackers, and so we did. Got hold of a camera. Spent time shooting fireworks and crackers. Got a close look at the new moon. After the fireworks, decide to blog it all and went in search of a internet centre. Could find one. So just went to Philo & Shantha's house to wish them. Spent some time there exchanging notes. Dei Ram, they asked me to convey thier congratulations to you. Due to a confidential agreement, I am unable to post what we discussed. Anyway it was good to spend sometime with friends again. The next day, Boxing Day, cricket match at MCG . Saw Sehwag hit a century before hurrying to the campus as usual by auto. The auto drivers near Fatima College have decided to have a photo of me as thier patron. I get salutes from them everytime I go to Madurai. Good to see customer care being practised by automen. I met Kicha at Campus. spent sometime at the railway station discussing a lot of things from marriage to friends. We then went to Jayaram Bakery for Kicha's treat. Didn't eat much there. After a couple of hours, we parted on our separate ways. Spent time at home in frot of the computer, playing with nephews and chatting with cousins. Caught the evening bus to Coimbatore. Had a lovely girl, (name : Anu) sitting across the aisle. Faded in and out of sleep watching another couple of horrible movies in the bus. I reached home after a lonely trudge in the dark. Went to sleep immediately. These two days brought out a new vigour into my life after quite sometime. Travelling always does this. It invigorates me. I only wish I could travel a lot more.

 Just I read the onsite story which rini posted..Really it's true and I'm seeing few of the stories in day today life.Now-a-days in IT field average age for marriage is slightly increased..'coz after degree we get into IT and it will take atleast 2 or 3 years to get the next promotion or to get a onsite chance..so no one want to postpone all these... But individual has to decide on what they really want . I am in chennai . My mother and grandma has come down to chennai..so I am here @ my home.I may go home for pongal..That too if I have some work at that time then need to be reconsidered. I applied for Visa this week. No immediate onsite chances since I have only 6 months experience..But just like that few of us in our account applied as per our IBU HRC's mail. Then it' s been so nice to hear from sindu after a long time..Valli I will try to meet you. Till jan 30th -There is a build for next release on that day.-I can't take leave. But try to take permission. Meet you all in the next blog.. Happy Hol's. Have Nice Time.... Cheers... Kavi

 I think, from the mid October itself contribution to the blogs from my side is comparitively less. Its not that I dont want to blog, or its not that I dont have info to share but, its that I am in a crucial change process which may / not click although a career is assured but Where!!! is the question?. Obviously believing in the best and hoping the gr8, I made use of stealth technology in the chessboard betn 2 careers either Infy / nway @ HSS. After MS, and deep search all ways(but not always)... finally goto into HSS on Nov 25 2k2. I started with a 3 months contract with the confirmation that I wont be confirmed thereafter, may be based on performance and mutual understanding the tenure will be extended. Fortune played in my life after 1.5 months of service: my responsibility increased, at that time I was very comfortable with clearcase (configuration mgt. tool) and a person (senior work wise) left the orgn. So I am very confident that they have to extend my tenure, they did so for another 6 mths with the confirmation that end of this period; if am doing good, I will be absorbed thereafter. After 9 months, fortune played in my life for the 2nd time, now, I am handling performance testing apart from my usual role and also supporting 2-3 projects. They came and convinced me by saying, everything is ok with me but the HR policy is something like they can take into their role only after 1 year contract period, nothing to worry, if u r maintaining the current level u r given the role etc...etc.... But, Ram Gopal cannot digest this, and on that day he applied for 3 orgn. although 2 clicked one out of which is onsite. I didnt left coz. 1. I wanted to be in a reputed orgn. HSS is doing good, so HSS or better than that 2. I dont want stay in the role of Support engr. i.e, config. mgt, cc admin, build and release engr. I want to be a s/w engr. Testing / Develpt will do for me... as I am doing performance testing thru which I am very familiar with the test envt. and since I am handling Build activities I can walk thru code and grasp to some extent. I saw an Add for 1-3 yr. exp needed in infy. I just applied, moreover by that time its 9 months completed from my earlier attempt for Infy. I do prepared to the maximum I can. Only Kicha / Manny know this directly from me...Appeared on Nov 02 2k3 with full confident that they cant reject me... The test was bit easy. I did 5/9 puzzles. 4 should be certainly right. I was called for interview...(altogether 4 rounds) it was too.. superb... Did well. In the final round I am very much confident they will call me...the same above two persons and some more know this....but 15 days I have to wait for the result... oooh... its difficult time, anytime HSS can give me the confirmation letter, Thank God, Till Nov. 17 I didnt received my confirmation letter. by Nov 15 I have received offer mail from Infy. Immdtly I shoot the mail to my manager for my relieving letter from Nov 28 2k3 moreover my contract also ends on Nov 30. All 3 mgrs. spoke to me. Saying everything is clear from our side, You can continue as Senior operations engr. But as I said I am moving to Infy as S/w engr. and as they are aware of its value which will be better for my long term career than theirs, even though they tried to convince me... atlast left with my own will to continue wherever I wish with their wishes for me. By this time most of our classmates know the info.... But I havent published directly. Atlast d'day came for me... and I reported in infy Dec 01 2k3, I am not very sure where they will put me, I joined as s/w engr. and I know I will be put in Unix Envt. (I like it) I was taken into Product Eng. and delvry Bsns unit. into a Cisco project... I was in trng. till date... now will be into projt. its for cisco&reg networking domain, going fine... Kicha!!!!! HSSlla sugama leisure ah erundhavane.. inga vandhu vellay seya.. soluraengala da..... hmmm irukatum... Continuation of this will be dealt later... i.e from Dec 01 2k3 - .... appuram HSS digital snaps llam, angaey vitutu vandhutaen.. sorry Rini kkum anupalla... Valli, Hearty welcome to you and Happy journey... Jax, sorry da Mentations nee daily pargathaey... I will let you know when u can regularly go thru that... Good start vizay.. keep it up...

Rest later, take care, Wish u had a Merry christmas... Cheers

 One of your Lap's top is holding the other Lap top..... Hope I got it perfectly by understanding the Aircraft interview in Jack's career. Get going Vijay... Will come soon with my huge blog.. Cheers

 Hey frenz, Just last week I blogged u all that sify didnt award a Laptop for me to carry. Dream came true and now my Laptop is on my Lap top. Though not Wi-Fi it is as cute it normally used to be. The other news is that I am the only employee of my company in my cadre to carry one such. Not that they gave me , to put it right I got it from them. yes I borrowed thoughts from Jack Welch and asked my boss " why not Lap top for me?" Being the fact that I have been sanctioned a PC at my office it became much more difficult for me to put justify my stand. Hurray ! at the end of the day my boss gave me his Lap top and said "best Of Luck". I can write a story named "Bala in wonderland". Nothing would make u more happier than an appreciation. I have imagined carrying one after 5 years. Ok I have also kick started my other dream ' fly within India twice in a day at the cost of my company' God stop me please! stop me please! Dei Vijay I always have appreciated your efforts to rise up every time you fall. None is 100% in this world it is the ability of winners to rise consistently. I belive you are a winner get going da. What Kicha, what Bala,what rini, what Manny.... ever body is trying to climb the ladder da. No body is on the top. Just press ur accelerator harder for a month and there you are over taking all of us. Best of Luck bala

 In the below blog, Plz spell Rama in the feminine character. There may be some grammatical, lexicon errors. All the errors are regretted.

 Rama finally decided to go against the decision of his family. Her family opposed her in going to work. Her elder sister Kowsalya said "Look Rama, ur child is only one and half year old. At the bar age of 33, will you be able to work? by staying away from your child and husband for more than 500 Kms". Rama wholeheartedly said "I want to give my child good education, Infact my hubby's dream is also that! We want to put our child in top of the charts, we want to give him the best in the world" Rama finally signed her appointment order. She joined as a clerical assistant in Housing development corporation India on 1st April 1977. To tell more about Rama, she was the last child of Sri.Ramasamy and Lakshmi ammal. In Hindu mythology,it is believed that the fifth girl child of any family will be a curse in the forecoming days. Rama was not an exception to that. When she was 7, her father's printing press was ransacked. The family lost Sri.Ramasamy and also its wealth and prestige. The elder brother-in-law of Rama, has got authentication from Rama's mother from unsigned papers and become the power of attorney of the family. Rama and his brother Srinivasan, Lakshmi ammal was caught by the death trap of poverty. The IInd brother in law is a dumb folded guy. While, the 3rd sister is about to get married. Rama's brother Srinivasan is on his way to acquire his IIIrd grade form in High school. Rama's elder brother-in-law threatened to suspend Rama's education. Lakshmi ammal, a lady of vision, supported her children in their education by pledging her jewels. Days passed by, Rama completed her PUC and his Brother Srinivasan got married to the Pattukottai Highness daughter Alamaermangai. Alamaermangai was brought up with a golden spoon. Rama had a additional burden to her education by washing Alamermangai clothes and assisting old Lakshmi ammal in her daily activities. Rama completed her BA, and she registered herself in the employment exchange of Madras. Rama's brother Srinivasan became the key of Alamermangai and he started scolding Rama and old mother. Rama and her mother lived seperately following the behavioural change of Srinivasan. The auscipious moment in Rama's life also took place. She tied her nuptial know with Parthasarthy. Parthasarthy failed in his PUC, passed his ITI and was working as a mechanic in a private company. The parenthood in Rama came by means of Sreevatsan. When Sreevatsan was one and half years old Rama took the decision to get into a job. Parthasarthy and her mother supported her decision. Rama was first posted in Muttam a small village in Kannyakumari district. Sreevatsan stayed with Parthasarthy, since Muttam did not have the facility to support Sreevatsan in his education. Sreevatsan was longing for his mother during his childhood days. The memories of Sreevatsan struck Rama in her work. Rama came to her hometown, to meet Sreevatsan once in a month. Sreevatsan grew in the midst care of his Grandmas. Parthasarthy and Rama, gave the best to Sreevatsan in all his academic activities. He was given best school education, good food, clothes, toys and kimps everything. When Sreevatsan was in 8th standard, Rama moved to her home town by getting transfer. When she came to hometown, she noticed a lot of change in Sreevatsan's behaviour! Sreevatsan spoke to Rama only a little. He was happy with Parthasarathy and his Grandmas. Rama could not accept the change in Sreevatsan. Parthasarathy assured her that things will be smooth in the fore-coming days. But everything went topsy-turvy for Rama in Sreevatsan's case. Days passed by, Sreevatsan completed his studies in IIT Rourkee, and he was appointed as Quality Control Engineer in HAL, Bangalore. He loved and married Ambika, who was his collegemate in IIT Rourkee. Ambika got selected as Maintenance Engineer in BHEL, Trichy. Ambika decided to stick to the job. But Rama opposed their decision. When Sreevatsan questioned her she said "Son I was the victim of my son's love , But you 2 don't be a victim of your lovehoods" Has Rama taken the Right decision? Is her case applicable in today's reality?

 Hi all, Merry Christmas Xavier....Hope you see this blog before friday..... Sorry for not answering your questions.....Finally my exams are over, & i'm working from home this week.... To anwser Xavier's & Kavitha's questions: I'm starting on Jan 11th.....My last leg is from Germany to Chennai & the flight's arrival time is, 13th, January, 12.00 A.M.....Kavi, I'll be there in Chennai for the next 13 hrs....My train to Karaikudi, is at 1.00 P.M on Jan 13th... But i would have to visit Chennai atleast three times, i guess....though the dates are not decided.... Had i got my tickets in British airways, I would have met Sindhu....unfortunately, could find a convinient one, only in Lufthansa!! Congrats Kicha......Keep Going man....You still have lots in store...... My boss gave me a gift for Christmas!!!.....A cool hand-knitted colorful woolen scarf.....The gift itself was wonderful & getting it from her, was even more joyful.... Yeah, so what do you guys think abt the get-together...Does that sound feasible?....If you feel it's feasible, please do e-mail Kicha, so that we could finalize our venue. That copyright issue.....was indeed an experience!!!....we have had lots of inputs about copyrights......Mahendran kalagam nanmayil mudindhadhu!!! The book review was great Vijay Babu..... Enjoy your hols & Merry Christmas, once again!!!

 Hello guys, Thats a absolutely amazing Kishore...congrats!...maintain the same temto thru out. Keep going Vijay Babu...will post mine in the near future. The blog on onsite tempted me so much that i decided to deviate from my usual course...so here iam blogging! To be honest the whole of last month i was torn between my career and personal life...life being highly uncertain...we dont know whats in store for us after 3 months...continue in UK, back to India or in a different country? Kishore questioned the decision of the couple to stay together in onsite...have they got any other choice?...i can quote instances where people got fired for declining onsite assignments..its no jolly ride for career oriented people to live in onsite.The barriers are too many that i really go crazy at times....cannot apply to goods jobs in top companies as they do not entertain applications from non UK and EU nationals...cannot get into any contract employment..if we end up in a different country or India and if at all i manage to get into a job will the stay be long enough for me to settle in a decent job...to top it cannot plan any vacation to India without concerns..in total my career is in a total disarray...the only thing I am clear about is I am not going to compromise my family life at any cost! Hey Ranjini..nan oru thara blog panna 100 times panna mathiri...so treat kuduthudu. Xavier your gift is on its way....ni ketta sundal!...here the xmas fever has reached to a height that people are going crazy...never seen so many hanging out in the streets after 8 in the evening...came across a dozen santa claus..dont think we'll have a white xmas but hoping one for new year...Merry Christmas. We are visiting Leeds and Manchester during the weenend.... Bye

 Ofcourse, even i wonder, if i would be able to review a book so simply and neatly as is done by Vijay. Good promising effort ya. Keep going! Hope to see such reviews soon. Better late than never!

 Hi everyone, I really feel bad for not participating in the blog. But 2 things are keeping me stay away from the blog, 1. Patni is not providing me internet during working hrs (9am to 6pm). 2. The content of the blog is threatening me. Most of the blog members are sending their book reviews and discussing some technical and managerial topics, which I hardly know. I can overcome that first block by either ask kicha to send me the blog content or by browse in cyber cafe. But I don’t know how I m going to overcome that second block. Whenever I read your blogs (mahendran, ranjini, xavier, bala, rajesh, ganesh, valli, sindhu, kavitha, sri, ram), I always ask myself that when I am going to post a blog like this??? But my inner mind says never. Then I again ask, hey u r a confident person, how can u say like this? Suddenly a reply comes like, if only u really know something, u can be confident in that thing. But the argument with my mind didn’t ends there; i tried to convince it by said that i also read two books recently named "One minute manager" and "Who moved my cheese". May be i took six days to read such a small books, but still for the first time in the past 24 years i completely read an English book. I may not be able to give a good review on it, but still i can mention some points from them. One-Minute Manager ------------------ It is a very small guide, which speaks about, 1. One minute goal setting 2. One minute praising and 3. One minute reprimand The first two points we heard many a times from many people. But the third point is the special one. It talks about how the manager has to react when he is not happy with his subordinates work. Like praising, whenever a subordinate commit a mistake, express him at that point itself and make him understand that u r only unhappy with his work and not unhappy with him as the person. I recommend this book for all our blog members, who haven’t read it earlier. Who moved my cheese ------------------ Hope almost everyone read that book, or at least heard about that book. This book is about change management. I think we learn a lot about change management than it is mentioned in that book. But the presentation of that book is good. They tried to explain it using interesting characters. It falls into “Needhi kadhikal”(if you read siruvarmalar from dinamalar then u know it) category. So I strongly recommend it to kids in your home. While reading this book, I came across the phrase “Better late than never”. Whenever I come across this phase one incident suddenly come into my mind. During our first trimester, one day infront of our library myself, kicha, valli and sindhu met balaji. He asked as about our welcome party. He told us why don’t you give pressure to your seniors to arrange it soon, it seems they are going on postponing it. For that except me all others replied something. While kicha replying, he told that “Better late than never”. I heard that for the first time. So always this sweet memory is attached to that phrase. After completing this write-up, my mind slowly begins to say; yes you can also contribute something to this blog. Thank God at last I convinced it. ------------------------ congrats for ranjini, ram and kicha. Mahendran:- eppadi da irukka. Sorry da I cant send mails to yahoo, rediff, and hotmail ids. That’s y I havnt send any mails. Pls send me ur official id, I can only send mails to that id. If anyone want to send mail to me, pls send it to the id, vijaybabu.balasubramanian@patni.com (don’t send from any mailing sites, I wont receive it. Send it from ur corporate id) ------------------------ I have to really thank our classmates, especially our blog members. For what??? Soon I will post it.

 Kicha, Nice link. On reading it, two quotations came to my mind. Fortes Fortuna adjuvat. - Fortune favours the brave Chance favours the prepared mind - Louis Pastuer Both statements can be considered an addendum to the article. BTW. Who was the first president of the United States of America? George Washington. Nope. Read urlLink this to know more.

 An interesting urlLink article I came across today... Why do some people get all the luck while others never get the breaks they deserve? A psychologist says he has discovered the answer.

 jax, I'll be leaving tomorrow night and be in Madurai on 25th morning.. But I'll be going to meet one kozhi.. whom I have caught for giving me a christmas treat at his home... He was my roommate when I had training in Mangalore... after the treat I don't have any more kozhis.. so may be, we'll try to meet that evening... The thing that jax was mentioning as the one me and valli were discussing is about a get-together... we are planning to have one somewhere.. and the dates will be Jan 25,26 ... the place is yet to be decided... so, if u can make it on that day please let me know.. bring in ur suggestions on where we can have it as well... only constraint is it must be relatively easy to reach for most people... depending on the number of people other required arrangements will be made... jax, send me ur mdu phone number.. i'll call u after I reach home on Christmas day...

 Kicha thatz a great news da. Get going. Congrats. Leela Palace is one admirable hotel but sad da I have not peeped in the Bar. Shall we?? guys roll ur sleeves up Infy seems to be over taking. Hope Sriprasath is so eager in getting a new topic in blog but no one has the courtesy to reply him. sri prasath only way to overcome is 'create a new ID on your own and reply to urself ' ha ha ha ha Guys and gals, u have read so many blogs from Sriprasath in the past one year. Please tell me if anybody has replied atleast once to sriprasath. There is a prize worth 10lackh if any body can find out (atleast)one useful blog from Sriprasath in the last century( sri will find this interesting). chottu

 Ranjini, the problem (the blog is displayed without any styles) appears the first time you open the blog for the very first time. Once you choose your favorite style, a cookie will be set in your computer so that you get the same style the next time. Incidentally, Mozilla based browsers are the only browsers where style switiching is enabled in the browser. Under the View menu, you can see a Use Style menu item. If you select it, you will be presented with a pop-up detailing all the styles that page links to. You can choose any one. The reason why a separate style switcher is provided with the blog is for those who use Internet Explorer, which does not have an inbuilt style switcher &aacute; la Mozilla. At first I left out the Style Switcher in the blog, but since IE users cannot select style sheets, I had to search for and modify the style switcher to use it. So it is not my fault. I feel that instead of urlLink Mozilla , you should use urlLink Mozilla Firebird . Firebird is faster, smaller and flexible than Mozilla or Internet Explorer. The reason why the blog is loaded with the Black stylesheet is because I set the blog to consider that stylesheet to be the default one. After loading, you can choose any style that you want to. Kicha: Congratulations. And when do I see you in Madurai? I am leaving tomorrow evening and will be spending the 25 th and the 26 th there. I'll collect my treat there. Manny: I was online when you posted your poem. But due to a problem in my system, I was unable to log into Blogger and give you my comments. It was interesting to read the success poem. I felt some tinges of "Man in the Mirror" in the poem. Inspiration!!. Hope to see more from you. Valli: No reply from you regarding your visit or the one Kicha and you were discussing? Bala: Unnaku, Wi-fi vennumma. Modhalau hard diskilla irrukura paddatheyyum, Rajesh oda mp3'sa delete pannu. Appuram floppy, hard disk ellam ollunga work pannum. Sindu: How's Christmas season there? Tell me about it. Ram: Mentations!!??!! Rini: Don't know why it bounced. I'll see what to do then. By the way, I see two lines appearing in the centre of " urlLink Flowers for you! ". Does it appear on yours? I'll try to send a screenshot if possible. There are quite a lot of Indian blogs in the blogosphere. The blogroll links to a few of them. I feel that Indian blogs are not much publicised. But there are quite a lot of blogs being written by Indians. the trouble is that we don't know them. Interestingly, " urlLink Elite Essays " had an article about one of my favourite novels, Pride and Prejudice . I guess I haven't given any book reviews for the past two weeks. I'll have them ready soon. Sri: Prof. Raja Govidaswamy's words is one reason why I still keep reading. Anyway my line of work requires it. As Valli had once said, reading has now moved from being just a hobby to a part of my job. See you all later.

 Good going man, keep it up! And jax if we view our blog using any other browser, only the default version is loaded or the black background one?

 Thanks Kavitha... as she has said, I feel good in continuing the tempo set by Ranjini.. I have been banded at the top band after confirmation.. I'm also assigned to a new project.. just like I was doing one a few months back.. but, this one seems to be a good project... and directly pertaining to my domain - EAI.. unlike the previous one, which was a web application project... This is a much bigger project involving integration with Peoplesoft, BizTalk and some legacy systems.. I'll be concentrating more on the BizTalk side... am looking forward to this...

 Hi all, Good day to you!! It is always a tough competition between my floppy and the system at office. As I dont get enough time reading and replying blog I just deploy floppy to transfer docs from office to home. when my brain starts working my floppy does not and when my floppy starts working I dont get time. When everything is fine, sad that I travel outside coimbatore. Let me get a wi-fi Latptop soon. So I thought If not today then it is going to be never. Rini that was a faux pas. yes it was the cost and not the price that I referred. When the cost goes up, adding to that my production units are fixed, naturally my quality comes down. Hope u would appreciate. Kicha sorry da once again my floppy didnt work. Bear with me dears because I am a sales guy, will not get enough time to sit and type. chottu Try to work smart; the day u feel u cant, start working hard. good luck frenz

 Many more Happy returns of the day da machan... wish you many more similar days to come... And hey, Today I met ganesh...he was in chennai today and came to my office...so glad to see him after a long time. We had a puf together after some months gap...but ironically i cud not spend more time with him... And even more irony is that I forgot to wish him for his B'day and I totally forgot that today is his birth day... Sorry da ganesh. And coming to scribbled scripts, Thanks rini for ur comments. But u dont have to compare VVS and Scribbled Scripts yaar. And rini do send ur inputs as u said. Mahendran Jayavel

 We are atmost nearing the completion of 2 successful years of life after college. Since, you guys and gals are talking about rejoiceful ways to celebrate your X-mas and New year celebrations. I want to putforth a question in front of u all? Have u found out any sort of remarkable changes in your life during this timeframe of 2 years? We keep on taking resolution year after year. Have anyone sticked to the resolution for the whole year? Is this life is like meeting a passerby now and then? Do these 2 years of your own earning has taught you something? We work till the last juice of the day for the corporate. Have we shared the same delightful, colourful, happy life with our closest circle, like we have shared during our college days. Guys and Gals, Plz blog down your views

 Hi all, Made the suggestions to Daddy's day, Premji's letter. Kicha, also to avoid future problems, I have modifed your Google post to point to the logo. Hope you don't mind. Bye,

 Thinking of Redesigning, i would like the blog to be more functional in nature. So please feel free to give your suggestions. The blog is a meeting place for more than ten souls. It is your place. 1) How many posts should appear in the home page? 2) In the existing format, what do you feel is missing? 3) What more can be added to the blog? 4) Do you think that any part of the blog is not al used by you / it just takes up space? 5) In the existing design, what parts do you actually find useful? 6) Any more of your suggestions are welcome in case I missed out anything Please take time to think about it and reply.

 Rini, Looking at the photos, I got a thought rolling in my head. The groups photo album, right now is divied into three directories: 2003 Memories Wedding Snaps The classifications seems good and based on functionality. (This is Xavier, the Information Architect speaking.)So what are a few wedding snaps doing in 2003 . They should be within Wedding Snaps . Since 2003 is almost over, snaps being uploaded in 2004, must be put in 2004. I have made the necessary changes. Photos of weddings (including engagements) are now present in the Wedding Snaps album. Hope you don't mind it. BTW: In case you didn't know, ROASM is updated everyday. Rini, as you had requested, it is now present in the blogroll.

 ya i did think of taking leave, but then dint want to waste my leaves, and on top of it, its LOP.. So thought let me come to office late than not to come at all. Yes kicha, its a valid point that, they ultimately decided to stay ON-SITE in the end too.....

 The focus of the story makes one thing clear about the couple.. they want to row two boats with a single oar... And the simple reply is, they are not going to do it.. There must be some point in time where a line needs to be drawn between family and career... Vivek and Shobana did have a number of ways to handle the situation. But they kept considering that an onsite opportunity is the "holy grail" that needs to be obeyed irrespective of family circumstances... which should not have been their attitude... Even at the close of the story, they decide it the hard way to stay "onsite"... This just needs a little thinking in the lines of their common goals... and the steps they need to take to support each other to achieve their individual ambitions too... And, what it requires is mutual understanding and proper prioritization of their life's activities...

 Rini, Seems to be a very tough problem to figure out. BUt that's life for you. So the moral of the story: If you are in IT, don't marry someone in IT. Is that it? BTW, Ram said you were on leave today. Couldn't resist blogging or is he mistaken?

 What ram, surprised? ya i thought let me come to office late, than not to come at all. So back to my seat! i have uploaded one snap to our groups section, its taken at my home, sweet home @ Bangalore ........ And my cousin is also found teasing me in the snap where as its taken by Srini! BTW guys what do u think about having a S/w er. as ur life partner? good that none of our friends have faced such problems and hope not to face in future too.... And yes friends, we bought a new TV Panasonic T(tau) series sometime last week and forgot to inform u people, there was a complaint from kicha and so i apologise, for not letting u people know stat!!!! Jax i too most probably will be in town for christmas and my next visit to madurai will be somewhere after pongal hols , mostly near republic days. So u can plan for b'lore only and come & have a look here how the christmas is! Heiiiiiiii Ganesh, advanced b'day wishes! and where are the snaps i had asked u ya? And Sindhu, maasathila oru naal blog pannittu, treat naanga onakku mariyathaiya kudukkanuma? Nee india vaa, naan onakku specialla mariyathai venaa pannidren.......
