 i revisit this stuff every once in a while, and today was one of those days. wade through the mundane factual relay - it gets crazy pretty early on. but the end is a regular novel begging me to write. skip ahead, skip ahead. the base comments come before shit falls horribly apart. fuck both Manuela and Fabrizio both. i'm still burning (gently now) over what happened over there. and yes, i'm still warm for Anna.

 12.02.2001 hi everyone! to those of you i've yet to email, yes i made it here in one piece. what a beautiful city bolzano is. true, it's winter and grey, but it's beautiful to me. quite the northern european mountain town. it's coldish, around 40 most of the time. but i'm bundled up appropriately, so the cold is more of an invigorating force than a troublesome one. my new family here is wonderful. the parents and i get along really well. i think we have a mutual respect worked out already. jacopo, the boy, is a bit shy with me, but that's expected considering he's 12 and there's a new girl in the household. ludovica is a doll. she demands a lot of my attention, but i'm willing to give it. she's so beautiful! their whole family is. my language acquisition is coming along slowly. it's amazing how much i'm having to depend on body language to understand what's going on when they're speaking italian. also, ludo is giving me vocabulary hoework assignments every couple of days to help me along. it's strange having everyone speak italian and german. everyone has to know both to be employed here. it's the law. once in a blue moon i'll encounter a friend of the folks who speaks english (british), but other than that, i'm a mute. ha! me, quiet. who'd have thought! i have a mobile number that i can receive calls on if anyone wants to... the number is 011-39-333-138-0507. it costs me a bundle to call out (imagine an international call on a cell!), but it's nearly nothing for me to receive. to make it cheaper on y'all, try using 101-6868. i think that makes it only like 15cents a minute for you. here's the website for more info: http://www.101-6868.com/101-6868_Rates.html remember, i'm 9 hours ahead of you folks in san diego. call anytime though before midnight my time. i'd love to hear from all of you (and emails are nice too)! i'm making my way here. last night i finally braved the supermarket on my own. 2000 lire equals about a buck, so imagine the mental calculations that have to occur. it's a pain. luckily though, things are a lot cheaper here. clothes aren't (what a bunch of fashion whores italians are!), but things like beer and smokes, my staples, are half the price. thank your government for making that so :) let's see... my apartment is finally taking shape now that i've had a chance to organize it. i have a beautiful view of the mountains, shrouded with fog/rain/snow today, and the beautiful traditionally european home next door. wooden shutters, intricate iron work, plant tendrils hanging from the balconies. my kitchen is about the size of a closet (no, not your closet, candice. i only wish), but it's functional. yesterday manuela bought me dishes so i can put my skills to use. the food here is good. nothing spectacular so far... although with friends like mine at home, i'm used to killer meals already. the difference is the way we eat, in courses. first pasta, then meat, then salad, then fruit. it's fun getting to focus attention on each thing rather than having the whole mess piled on one plate... there's more dished though this way, and guess who gets to do them :) i've yet to try the wine. i have a bottle in my apartment, but i've been drinking moretti most of the time instead. there are grape vines in almost everyone's yard. i can see some out my window. Ludo wants to say hello to everyone: I'm very happy with Charlotte. She is very nice. i play mario cart with Charlotte.bye,ciao!!! aw, how sweet. well, the family is here, and i really shouldn't spend too much more time on the computer than i already have. i still need to read my sunday new york times on the web for my sunday to be complete. i'm doing alright. adjusting quicker than i expected. of course, i'm a bit lonely. i feel like regan, 'the great communicator' reduced to the most basic foundations. ok, so it's not that dramatic, but i feel the connection. i'll write again. and sorry if i took so long to say hello to all of you. again, feel free to call and write. ciao, charlotte 12.04.2001 god this keyboard is weird. i have to hit ctrl, alt, and another key just to get the @ symbol to appear. there's four symbols on one key! ok... well, i'm doing very well today. tonight i was left alone to cook for the kids. ludo is so demanding for my attention, it's starting to become an irritation. like, back off, kid. i /am/ an adult. i don't know... it's nice to be wanted, but she takes it a little too far. just time to draw some boundaries of what's acceptable. she just wants to play. manuela took me out shopping at the grocery store, the big one rather than the little one down the street. once a week, we go shopping at the big store. it's like ralph's only smaller. we buy our fruits and veggies at another store, a little shop really. they deliver the produce to the door later on. manu decided it would be fun for me to cook mexican for the kids one night, so she bought some taco shells (a ridiculous looking 'kit' to make 'em) and some tortilla chips and salsa of questionable origin. ick, but i'll manage. tonight we had a veggie soup with bits of pasta like orzo... i dunno what it is. the veggies were a bag of finely chopped who-knows-what, plus some potatos that i added. it cooked all day, making it easy on me because i had manu helping me get it almost finished. no garbage disposal here either, so the clean up is a bit more involved. also, we had some beef and a salad. the meals go: soup or pasta first, then the meat, then the salad, then fruit if that's a part of it. it's interesting, eating here. i'm still super self-conscious about cooking. but the kids seemed to like it, so i didn't fail too miserably. ha. i did fine. i knew i would. but still, i want to be as perfect as possible, impressing them at every turn. it's just my nature. or dad's training, i don't know which :) at the store, manu bought me a pan and a pot so that i can cook finally. i picked up a bottle of wine and some beer that manu insisted is the best, a spanish brand called san miguel. i'll check it out when i get home. also, the thing to eat for 'snacks' here is a plate of cheeses, bread, and proscuitto. there's this special type of prosciutto from this region called speck (yes, that's how it's spelled) that's insanely good. you don't put all the elements together. rather, you eat them separately. it's fun. their kitchen is nice but tiny. granite and gas, a really well done kitchen for the space. fridge hidden as cupboards, all of that. like i said, no garbal. cans don't recycle here... bottles and trash go in separate receptacles on the street. hm... no ice cubes. europeans don't like ice i guess. manu looked at me like i had two heads when i poured coffee over the ice that i could find in the freezer. oh well. i asked for another hug today before she left town. she laughed and gave one to me, saying that it was so sweet. i need mommy love over here being so far away from home! she's warming up to me i can tell. treating me more like a friend/part of the family than a new addition. also, i thought it would be nice to write her a quick note letting her know that she can talk to me about anything she needs to, that i'm open to hear her concerns (where i'm concerned), and that i realise that this is also an adjustment for her too. she loved the gesture. and i feel better. i think that really helped her to understand where i'm coming from. hm. this weekend i think the plan, at least for a portion of it, is to go with fabrizio (the z is more like a t) and the kids up to the mountains (a whole 20 min away) so that he can show me the view and get out of dodge. not that this adorable village/town is anything one needs to get away from, but he's excited to show me his world. and hell, i can't wait! he promised me some spectacular views. he's such a nice guy. he wants me to meet his parents this weekend as well. he warned me though that they do not speak any english, but that it isn't the point. i'm learning more and more what communication can take place without the use of verbal or written language. speaking of language, ludo gave me some homework last night. body parts in italian. i memorized them all in a night, gaining her and her fathers' kudos. i'm impressed myself. but then again, italian is all i'm hearing. and my understanding is key for my social survival outside of the household. and within where ludo is concerned. manu mentioned today that she let a few people my age know that i'm here. a possible social outlet! there's a boy who's 21 and a girl who's 18. good enough. that'll come later, my meeting them. but there's hope of cultivating a life for myself in bolzano. also, manu wants me to meet a couple of young men (23-25) who she thinks are hot. "but too young for me." interesting... i get the feeling that the parents live two different lives in more ways than what you'd assume. i asked manu today how it was that she lost 20kilos, and she replied "being in love." ok, now... we all know that it's really hard to stay in love, that level of it anyway, with someone you've been married to for a long(ish) time. ok, i don't want to know. what's good for them is good period. ok. Ludo wants to say hello to everyone. I'm Ludovica and Charlotte is so nice to me.I am the italien teacher to Charlotte!!!bye!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ok, it's time for me to go upstairs now. i hope everything's well with y'all. ciao, charlotte 12.04.2001 hi again. ah, another free morning. the sky looks as if it's scheming an attack of rain today. i suppose i don't mind so long as i remember to borrow an umbrella from the fam. for now, i'm safely inside their house with my email and some CDs. manuela is at work until about one, so i've got the place to myself for a bit. yesterday was difficult. i found myself sitting on the floor of their living room looking out the window deep in thought when the tears came choking up to the surface. it wasn't for any reason in particular, anything specific that i was thinking about... just a general sadness, feeling sorry for myself for being so alone, i dunno. like a puppy, i slinked into the room where manuela was sitting and set myself down on the floor at her feet. i just need to connect with people. i realise it's a lot to ask of the parents to function as my social outlets in addition to what already constitutes their lives. but hell, they're the only ones who i have contact with who understand english. i pulled myself together enough to stop crying so that i could take up manu's offer to go out for a coffee. macchiatos are fantastic. i was hoping this offer had something to do with sitting down and a conversation, but it ended up being another episode of charlotte the lost puppy. she downed her drink and drug me around town to talk to some folks about a business situation. so there i stand, acting mute (which i am for god's sake) and staring out the windows once again, trying not to look bored or impatient. thanks manuela. i feel much better now. we got out the christmas crap out of the basement and put up some decorations. remembering that i'm going to be away from my family for the holidays was another blow to my sense of security and happiness. so i grabbed my journal from upstairs and went to it. i have to say that all this stifled communication has augmented my ability to write. but what purpose does this serve? i need human connection, not a bunch of lifeless pages that will be an interesting read years from now. by the end of the day, i felt much better. i had mom call, and we spoke for about 30 minutes. ah, english. and someone who knows me! also, picking ludo up from school and just being around her trouble-free smiling face was an uplifter. dinner was great. i did the dishes and almost ran upstairs to finish off a bottle of wine and write some more. headphones and load music are a must in the evenings. shit, it's not like the german and italian tv is going to distract me from my solitude. hopefully today i'll make some headway in terms of contacting some acquaintances of the parents who speak english and are somewhere around my age. other plans include a trip to the market for some food and wine. i've got to make deliberate efforts to do the simplest, most basic things. ok. well, i ought to go. i hope all is well in the states. love, charlotte 12.04.2001 again at the computer. i've realised that getting myself downstairs in the morning while everyone is either at work or school is the best thing to allow me to actually get some writing done. my music, no distractions, no eyes over my shoulder (even if they can't read it)... i can drink iced coffee without people looking at me like i've grown six heads. i've got a little bit of p.funk and james brown on the stereo. and i still have an hour here to myself before manu returns from work. yesterday was difficult for me.i found myself sitting on the floor of their living room looking out the window deep in thought when the tears came choking up to the surface. it wasn't for any reason in particular, anything specific that i was thinking about... just a general sadness, feeling sorry for myself for being so alone, i dunno. like a puppy, i slinked into the room where manuela was sitting and set myself down on the floor at her feet. i just need to connect with people. i realise it's a lot to ask of the parents to function as my social outlets in addition to what already constitutes their lives. but hell, they're the only ones who i have contact with who understand english. i pulled myself together enough to stop crying so that i could take up manu's offer to go out for a coffee. macchiatos are fantastic. i was hoping this offer had something to do with sitting down and a conversation, but it ended up being another episode of charlotte the lost puppy. she downed her drink and drug me around town to talk to some folks about a business situation. so there i stand, acting mute (which i am for god's sake) and staring out the windows once again, trying not to look bored or impatient. thanks manuela. i feel much better now. i'm hoping that today will be better. i don't feel lonely. the sky looks as if it's plotting an attack of rain, but i'm cozy inside the house and it's not affecting me, the low light and wind. i think today i'm going to push to get myself connected with a couple of young folks that manu knows (who speak english!). i just need people to hang out with, to have a laugh with, to speak with w/o the stilted, deliberate speech i use to communicate with the family. time to flip the soundtrack to something else. the dad is fond of this band from britain called Lighthouse Family. the album he always puts on is called "whatever it takes to get through the day" -- and no it's not as desperate as the title suggests. it has become my theme Cd for the trip, one i'll be buying once i return to the states to access rememberance. i just got here... i don't know why i'm thinking about missing them already. rock on, leslie. i'll write again soon. charlotte 12.07.2001 hello again everyone. it's yet another beautiful day in bolzano. the trees continue to shed their leaves, reminding me of the time all those butterflies came through san diego early this summer. the air is crisp and dry and so clear. mountain air really is better. especially when it bares the added characteristic of being foreign. again, i have my morning to myself. a bottle of wine accompanying two long phone calls from bryan and mae last night left me feeling drowsily content when i awoke. thanks you guys! it made my day to hear your voices. and good timing too... it just so happened that i had the night off, getting a chance to actually cook for myself. it wasn't pretty... i haven't the means to create anything remarkable with only one burner on the stove to use. manuela wishes for me not to use the other three gas burners. the thing's old, and i can see her point. wouldn't that be a story? "filthy american blows up building in upscale Bolzano" i'm still searching for a decent local wine. i'm saving the bottles after drinking them and attaching little bits of paper to them to remind myself of what they're like, rating them with letter grades for when the time comes to bring a few home with me. nothing above a B so far. but i'm looking, you guys. don't fret, my wine drinking comrades. disappointingly, the VCR is broken at the family's place, so the movies i've been dying to see are left in their boxes. i crave american entertainment. well, not so much the TV. i get everything from ally mcbeal to colombo dubbed in various languages, and i have to say that some shows just suck no matter if you can understand them or not. i miss my movies though! the plan for the weekend was to head up to the mountains with the kids and fabrizio for skiing lessons (for the kids, nada me), but seeing as though there's no snow, i'm not sure what the plan will be. i think we'll make the trek anyway and go for a walk. i'd really like a chance to get out and see a little bit more of italy than what's within walking distance of the apartment. we'll see. i have to say that i feel absolutely ridiculous in ski clothes. ok, so im a beach girl, southern california all the way. we'll see... maybe it won't snow at all for the entire season. ha! fat chance. you skiers on the other end are probably grinding your teeth at my disinterest to ski out here. but come on, what part of being in traction in a foreign country sounds fun to you? ok, manu is back, and like always, i'm trying my best to exist as little as possible. time to sneak out the door, go find my pan-handler, and hit the store for some more wine and food. hope all is well in the states. much love, charlotte 12.10.2001 (to leslie) hi again. i thought i'd email you directly as well in addition to the group mailing. sounds like you've got your hands full between the photography and the practice! good for you though. i'd give anything to have things to do, to feel capable of meeting a deadline, to have a project to occupy myself with. but enough about me... do you see many clients with all that extracurricular stuff going on? i can't imagine that you'd have that much time. the puddles are frozen. no snow, it's too dry. i pray for a storm. something dramatic to break up the monotony. yes, i'm bored, trying my best to be still in my skin... but i've so much time to sit and think. i don't feel much like a participant today. this whole weekend was an exercise in removal. like i said in the group mailing, i haven't spoken since saturday morning. you know me, and you know how much i depend on communication for release, for connection. this is becoming quite taxing. the need for connection. that too is a toughie. i wish more than anything that i could crawl over to manuela, curl up in her lap like a kitten and just be. of course, then i have to contend with my 'issues.' not that i'm concerned that i'd push the limits. i know where they are, and i'm not in a space to try to manipulate them. that's just a note in the margins. the thing is, she's not affectionate that way, i can tell. and the last thing i'd want is for a moment of personal vulnerability to feel like... to feel anything but safe and pure. and we don't know each other well enough for that to be. i suppose i could ask her... but i'm not sure i want to in case... ugh. i'm afraid to be vulnerable. of being rejected, even though she's not an ice queen. i know she understands. maybe i'll try to make that enough. i thought about it, about you, how long it has been since i've given you any sort of update on my life up until now. did you know i've been working in hollywood doing film production? just production assistant work until i build my knowledge base and my contacts (and put in my time like everyone else). the only project i've worked on so far is the Sony film "spiderman" that's coming out this summer. not exactly my kind of movie... lots of explosions and ridiculous sequences of plot devices. anyway, it's still pretty exciting work. long hours, tons of differnt people pulling together to get it done. that's what i have to look forward to when i return. i have a friend, two actually, who live and work up there in LA. they help me get hooked up with jobs. that, and i work at trader joe's. it's fun, decent money, physical, and i get to munch on all the great food. it's one of those transitional jobs until i embrace the LA lifestyle full on. lots of different folks work there too. i like the social aspect as much as the job. also... let's see... i had a girlfriend of sorts before i left, but i broke up with her a couple of weeks before my departure. really needy and insecure, older than me but acted like a teenager once things got rolling. i dunno. i tried. i learned plenty. mostly about where i'm drawing the line these days. and it's much improved, thank you very much. also, that's my first swing at things since the nightmare claudia. so all things considered, it went pretty well. didn't last that long, but then again i didn't let it go on once i saw the bottom. i need more than a fuck puppet, if you'll pardon the disgusting imagry. she just wasn't up to par socially. she hasn't lived the same kind of life that i have either. really key things she couldn't understand but thought she could. mostly though, she was just really too immature for me. so doting, wanting all my attention but then having nothing to say when she got it. ick. i' glad i had leaving the country to augment the separation. and then there's school. ick. still not done. been going about half time for a while at san marcos. i like the school, but i'm just not into playing the game right now. a professor singled me out to ask me what the hell i'm doing, not realising that just because i was one of five in her class of 50 to get an A that the rest of my studies were in the shitter. it was a women's literature adapted to film class, go figure i'd eat it alive. what i told her still makes me laugh. i'm an intellectual snob. i've grown to be very particular about what i allow into my head, and when something doesn't excite me or do anything for me, i won't entertain it. we laughed together at my explanation at least. i dunno though. after what i've allowed to rule my consciousness, what a mess that can lead to when your mind is infected, working against you... i think being protective to the point of paranoia is a step in the right direction, albeit extreme. so no, me and school aren't getting along. it's not just paranoia. it's about a feeling of limited space in my head where useless crap has no place. and it's also about failure, and i've assigned that label to my school career. i could work at it, but a break is definitely going to be part of the process. so claudia... i might as well bite the bullet and give you an update. i never did follow up on filing any report. i resent her. she knows she sucks. she came into trader joe's one day not knowing that i work there. ha! she looked terrified, super nervous, like a deer in crosshairs. i was immediately /very/ aware that she wasn't going to be shopping there again any time soon. good, run. you know, i could ruin her life by reporting her, but then again, what more is there to ruin? i know, i know... it's something that could potentially affect more than just me, what she did, what she's capable of. but you know, it's so over and behind me. the last thing i want to do is make her a part of my reality again. plus, somewhere in me i still have compassion for her. she's just another human being. troubled, but a soul. hm... i think that's just about everything in terms of an update. chris, my brother, bought a house last year and a porche this year. still with axia... no wedding plans nailed down, but they're quite in love. marriage ain't the end all and be all anyway if you ask me. the folks are doing well, building a new house in julian. knocked the old one down, making this one have a kitchen half the size of the downstairs, i swear. it'll be finished by the time i return, and i can't wait to run away to it. i've got to run out and pick up ludo from school. write when you want to. sounds like you haven't too much time for idle chatter :) lots of love, charlotte 12.11.2001 (to leslie) god, hearing from you is such a breath of fresh air! no, i didn't take your listing of obligations as a hint that you didn't have time to write to me. i only mean to say that i understand what a crunch it can be to be juggling so much at once. well, i'm struggling a bit here. last night and today... hm, i have a slight hangover... this may not be the most brilliant of writing installments. last night, maybe it was the intense cold outside (-5C... now /that's/ cold) compounded with the hormonal surge (or drop, i forget) of starting my period. no, it was all these things, plus being treated once again like a piece of furniture here at the house. i couldn't stop the tears from coming, so i left. i went upstairs and cried my eyes out for about an hour, opened a bottle of wine and knocked myself out. the tears were good... the wine has rendered me dazed and sickly this morning. before the tears... i was trying to chat with manuela while we were making dinner. nothing involved. just casual crap. she doesn't even try to feign interest, leslie. i once heard someone say before i left, "you'll never feel lonely with an italian family." ha! it feels as if she's deliberately tuning me out. and i'm not saying very much, not requiring anything of her, just trying to be friendly. i'm realising finally that as far as the family is concerned, i'm only here to serve a function. babysitting ludo. i'm a fashionable accessory to their yuppie lifestyle. what ever happened to the cultural exchange part of the package? when i met fabrizio, he spoke at length of how important he thinks it is to be exposed to different cultures, to share different perspectives. however, what i'm seeing is that they don't want to share themselves at all. i'm here to speak english when ludo needs help formulating a sentence and that's it. so to answer your p.s., i have no idea what italians think of the US, the war, any of that... i tried once to get an opinion out of manuela, and she blew me off saying she doesn't like politics. that it doesn't matter!! fabrizio, when i tried talking to him, said more or less that political concerns fade when you get older and you realise that you can't change anything. oh lovely! what a champion of strength you are! and that was the end of it. i hope i don't leave here with that as my impression of italians and politics. maybe i'm making all of this up, my impression of their disinterest in me. maybe they're just shallow people with nothing to say. it's possible. it's very possible. ok, i'm pissed. can you tell?:) my expectations weren't met, and now i find myself having to reformulate my ideas about this trip and what I want out of it. i'm disappointed! i refuse to waste my efforts trying to make myself available. today i'm going to buy some film and start taking pictures. i'm determined to make this work for me. ok, enough with the ranting. hm, yes... when i get home i do plan to continue my work in the film industry. it all depends on whether shannon and jason are working. in the beginning, i mean. i still don't have the contacts to get hired on my own unless i'm under shannon. her husband is a grip. she's usually a 1st PA or 2nd AD (production assistant, assistant director). shannon likes 2nd unit work, the crew that films the action sequences and explosions, car chases, all that good stuff. i need to get on with life, take risks. this opportunity to be working with her is too perfect to pass up. trader's is cool. but it's a vortex for wasted talent. i've spun my wheels long enough underestimating myself. i've got to do something challenging, something creative. and yes, leave encinitas so that i don't have to keep running into claudia. i finally feel like i'm bigger than all of it. that i have power over her and that she can't touch me any longer. she really did some damage to me, and yes, it's still something that i have to work through. just a lot less frequently than i used to. it has been over two years now since i've been in regular contact with her. in two more, i'm sure i'll be even further away from it. as far as i'm feeling about it.... that i'm not really up to discussing today... but i'd like to soon. well, tonight i actually get to go out to dinner with fabrizio and his old english teacher, a cute brit named anna. i can't wait for the chance to speak in my own language, at a pace i'm used to. i'll let you know how it goes. good luck with the rats. eWWW!! --charlotte 12.11.2001 (to leslie) well, i suck. manuela was SO nice to me today. i feel a touch regretful that i bitched her to you. but only a little:) ah! i found a gym!! it's 100.000 lire a month (50bucks or so) and i can go whenever i want. the guy there, Ivo, even speaks some english. yes!! two needs satisfied in one. manu walked me over there about an hour ago while the german teacher was here for the kids. we got a macchiato at her favorite bar (where there's a bartender who speaks french! i struggle to communicate with him, but my french is better understood than spoken). and... i met ludo's english teacher on the street while i walked her home. makayla, i think. what a hoot! she's in her 30s, american born (LA) but with italian parents. all this after such a shitty night and a hungover morning. and tonight i go to dinner with fabrizio and his english teacher. i'm excited to get some adult time. i absolutely love ludo, but she is eight. ah... just wanted to revise the bitch session from this morning. i'm doing so much better. enjoy the darkroom. love, charlotte 12.12.2001 ok, so i'm feeling better today than i have this entire trip. going to dinner with fabrizio and anna last night was the cat's meow. i had such a good time!! this woman anna is super cool, a brit who has lived here for 16 years (she's about to turn 40). she teaches english to folks here, more of a client relationship sort of thing than a teacher/instructor. she does private lessons. she's a linguist, no doubt. very verbal. she's warm (polar opposite of manu), has a sharp sense of humor, opinions, insights, and curiousity. and god bless her, we hit it off incredibly well. fabrizio sat silent through most of the two and a half hour affair, which i gather from her is his usual m.o. -- just like jacopo. we spoke about all sorts of things, and in depth. about world politics, the nature of language, the prada kids, work, travel, our respective families... i had a blast finally getting to laugh and joke. and speak and listen! the meal was pretty good too. the wine was even better, an italian pinot noir named patricia. go figure. i had this very local dish to start, kind of a bread ball sort of thing, three flavors... spinach, beat, and seafood. cut in half over juliened veggies. i forget the name, but i'll ask fabrizio later to make note of it. then fish, which was pretty good. the asperagus was overcooked. so, not only is she joining my gym at the first of january... yeah!!! she made it clear that she wants to see me again, asking me several times if she could give me a call to go for drinks or a coffee and to show me around a bit. glad i didn't have to initiate that. and she has an english language film collection that she offered up to me! yes!! ah, that was the single most refreshing night since my arrival here. i feel so much better! today, i'm even motivated for exercise, something i've been too down to take up with any sort of passion. i think i'll borrow the house football and make my way out to the park to juggle. i'll join the gym later this week. an interesting note: fabrizio was kind of weird about relaying the sotry of our meeting, very reluctant to discuss it like he was guarding the truth that we didn't know each other hardly at all before we made this deal. i looked to him after she asked if we knew each other before my coming out here, to get him to participate in the story telling, and he was SO closed mouthed. is he embarrassed that he didn't even know me? does he think he should have spent more time with me before making the decision to invite me? hm. looks like i'm going to have to try my hand at the ATM machine sooner or later. to pay for the gym, i'm going to be using all of my remaining cash. 200.000 lire for the start up fee and the first month. that's roughly 100 bucks. after the almost 200 for the ski clothes (they went on sunday without me!), my funds are dwindling. oh well. maybe manu will go with me to try to withdrawl money when we hit the post office today to pick up my packages. well, off to kick a ball around. then to the store for some provisions. more later, i'm sure. --charlotte 12.13.2001 ah... dramatic weather makes me want to write. there's a storm kicking up outside, wind and clouds steadily building momentum since the early afternoon. i'm praying for rain, although what i'm realising is that this will mean snow this evening if it does break loose with some dampness. i'm waiting, watching, drinking hot coco with ludo and monitoring the trees. this afternoon i found myself sitting quietly in my room. no tv, no music, no lights on. just sitting still, unwilling to get up to take off my coat even. i felt peaceful. a long night of nightmares rendered me restlessly awake this morning, so it was nice to have a clear head in my waking hours. i successfully avoiding manu this morning. i arrived at the house with ludo after school to an empty house and a grocery list. looks like the kids and i are alone tonight again from what i can tell from the list -- hamburgers. that's just fine with me, the meal and the downtime from fussy mommy. hm... i'm going to have to keep an eye on this attitude i'm developing. it's becoming way too comfortable. as you've all heard way too much, i'm really not into her lately. i'm glad to see that the notice from the post office has disappeared from its place on the table by the door. it told me of two packages that are due to me, packages that i have to wait for help to get my hands on. i can't just walk over there (i don't even know where it is) and ask for them. hopefully the slip's disappearance is a sign that someone is picking them up for me. then again, who knows. it's been there for three days already... maybe it got thrown away. i know there's a sweater in one of those, and i could sure use it these days. -10C at night is wicked, folks. the wind that began today is only worsening that. ludo and i are getting along infamously. well, strike the negative connotation of the word. how about famously. i just love that kid! and i can see where my attention is helping her in light of her mother's issues. she and i are pals, affectionate, laughing, and learning a whole hell of a lot of english. she can now have entire conversations with me, not only fragments of words. i'm so impressed with how quickly she picks things up, and /remembers/ phrases and expressions! i mentioned her progress to manu yesterday, but she only shrugged and said "good." well, /i/ know that i'm doing my job here. and a damn good one at that judging by ludo's conversational abilities. i wish it didn't concern me, manu's behaviour. but it does. she's the head of the household for all intents and purposes. i guess it'll have to suffice to assume, maybe incorrectly, that she appreciates my efforts. the weekend is drawing near. i encourage all of you to give a call sometime seeing as though i'll probably be on my own once again. boo- hoo, all alone! no, really, i can't wait for the space. i don't know if i'm supposed to disappear, but i kind of like to. getting a phone call from the real world would be swell. beautiful silence and conversations with loved ones. god, i'm going to miss you all at christmas. i feel so mushy this time of year, all the quality time with family and friends, reflecting on a year passed. what's it going to be like not getting to see any of you? will i stay in my room or will i want to try to hang out with a less than loving family here? what's worse? ok, what's better? i'll have to see. well, i gotta go. we have to make it to the market before it gets dark. and before it rains to hard. more later... charlotte 12.14.2001 another day... the sun is out, so i may go for a walk at some point. i finally broke down and bought some film yesterday while me and ludo were at the store down the street. i took a couple of pictures of the little bugger at her request. she's such a doll. i can't wait to get home and set up a website or something to make the images of my trip accessible to everyone. until then, i suppose i can only describe them in written form. last night was relatively uneventful. jacopo in his room as usual, locked door, the broken glass sound of him rummaging through his tub of legos coming from the room, occasional outbursts of singing. i still don't know what i should do with him, whether it's best to allow him to disappear like that all the time or whether i should make more of an effort to get him to participate. i realise too though that it's not up to me to lay down the law and get him to change his behaviour. this is his parents' idea. if they want it to really work, they're going to have to step in and speak with him. not that good communication is a characteristic i'd attach to my description of this family. ok, sure. i don't understand a lot of what /is/ said between them. it may be the most concise language ever spoken, making up for the lack of frequency. but i doubt it. i'm assuming it's about on the same level as how i'm spoken to-- the bare facts and little else. i'm still trying to get used to it. it's no wonder jacopo is so silent. with his parents as role models, i can't see him ever really breaking through and sitting down to converse with me. another episode of the watchful eye: putting ludo to bed last night, again in her parent's bed, sparked my curiousity. i figured i would ask her, now that our ability to have conversations has improved so much and it wouldn't just frustrate her to hear words she doesn't understand. i asked her about why she likes to sleep in this bed instead of hers. and, doesn't it get crowded with three people? she said she almost always sleeps in here, and that when her dad comes home, he sleeps with her, never her mom. her mom always sleeps alone in ludo's room. huh. an innocuous question to an 8 year-old, but loaded with insight to me. i mean, it's not like i didn't see that one coming. but to know it. it's sad. at least ludo seems to be getting what she needs. it makes me so happy to know how the attention and love i'm able to give is helping her. her mother just doesn't have the time to dote on her. she's the center of my universe here. the way she is with me lately, so loving and affectionate in return, just makes my day. she's the sweetest kid. i'm trying not to think about how hard it's going to be for her when i leave. you don't miss something until you've had it and lost it. so today i think i'll talk to manuela about something that pissed me off the other night. i feel a little weak in anticipation, just in case it comes off as confrontational. but in another sense, i'm feeling a lot stronger about asserting myself. what, like i'm going to alienate myself?! too late. manu basically made me look like an ass telling the woman that i showed up here without any clothes for the cold, like i'm too stupid to understand what i need. actually, her husband told me specifically not to buy clothes at home, to wait until i get here to go shopping with manu. that things were much cheaper (they sure as hell aren't), and that it would be best to wait. if that's what she thinks, that i really am too stupid to plan ahead, no wonder she treats me the way she does. what else didn't get communicated between the time that fabrizio met me and my arrival? did they even discuss between them their expectations of me? maybe to her, this was a perfect opportunity to pull away from her familial duties even further. maybe she expected me to step into her shoes and take over on all the little duties she finds to be beneath her now that she's so wonderfully independent. i'd understand her attitude better if i knew this to be the case. god, my universe is tiny. it bothers me to dwell on it, what probably seems like interpersonal minutae to everyone outside of the situation. well, she ought to be home soon. and kicking me off of the computer upon her arrival so that she can do her usual internet cam chat with her pals on her lunch break. and i should go tend to my laundry. you know, all the clothes that i don't have. so i'm bitchy? adieu, y'all. --charlotte here's my bitch... i was talking to ludo's ballet teacher on wednesday. she knows some english, so we made small talk. she said that she heard from manuela that i'm from san diego and said that she's love to go there sometime. all the warm weather appealed to her, all that. so then she says, "all this cold here must be strange for you. manuela told me that you showed up here without any clothes to wear, that you were completely unprepared for the weather here." thanks! 12.14.2001 ok, everyone. i just went shopping, and you all know how that affects me. yippie! spending lire! manuela decided at the last minute that we'd go shopping. i think my mentioning to her about the ballet teacher's comments, that i intentionally came without clothes, made her think. so we went out. i bought a couple of things at Mad's (www.mads.it)... a chocolate brown wool sweater and another layer-type sweater thing that's plum purple. i should have bought more while the offer was up, but i still needed to hit the ATM. maybe now that i've broken the ice with the gals that work there, i won't be such a chicken to go back. or somewhere else. so there's improvement. manuela was a different person with me tonight too. she even started talking to me about her boyfriend and a super romantic trip they took to venice, about having a boat, drifting along a canal with the windows in the houses they past illuminated with candles to announce that they're having a party. she was actually giving me unsolicited information rather than having me feel like a chump for trying to spark up even casual conversation. upon receiving emails from a lot of you, i'm struck with the awareness that i sound really unhappy here. ok, so i am in a lot of ways. but this isn't a prison sentence. far from it. it's just that email is my ventilation duct, my platform to talk about all the things that i can't talk about to anyone here. i'm really doing better than it seems, trust me. plus, who of you doesn't know me to be at least a little dramatic? huh? exactly. ok, i'm free for the evening. can't wait to play with my new clothes and crack open a cold one. yahoo! love, charlotte hey! where's my phone calls, eh? 12.16.2001 nothing like a sunday. true, it's not the same without tim russert in the morning, a jug of coffee, and the sunday nytimes. but then again, i did sleep in til noon today, so i missed the morning anyway. just after waking up, contemplating coffee and a shower, a heard a knock at the door. it was fabrizio coming to tell me that he and the kids were going out, that they'd be back this evening after six. he smiled at me as usual, mostly because i was still in my pajamas at 12:00. at least i wasn't woken up by him. that would have been a little more embarrassing than just standing in the door jam with tosseled hair and mascara remnants around my eyes. ah, he classy american strikes again. where they were off to was to ludovica's christmas thing at school. you know the rutine, a mess of children singing christmas songs more or less together. the kind of event that makes you smile and cringe with laughter than it is touching to see your kid up there. but i know it means a lot to ludo. she sings her songs to me all the time, and they span five languages which is pretty cool. so sweet, right? well, guess who's in verona for the weekend and isn't going to show up. when ludo found out the other day that her mom wasn't going to come, she cried. poor kid. god, manuela makes my skin crawl sometimes. i know it's not exactly a night at the opera (unless we're talking groucho marx), but shit. at least her dad and brother are going, taking her out to lunch before hand. and at least i have the day to myself in their house, free to write and listen to CDs. i already hit the store this morning for some food and beer. not much else on my agenda today. maybe a little cleaning, nothing more. i thought of running into town where i've seen a guy selling perfect long stemmed roses for 5000 lire a piece. but i've been informed that when buying things from street vendors, you're supposed to like haggle about the price or something. so not interested. plus i'm ill equiped language wise. but for ludo, i wanted to grab her a couple and have them here for when she gets home from her big debut. oh well. made tacos last night for the kids. GAG! not surprisingly, mexican food is impossible to do justice to here in bolzano. i tried to wing it, but it's so not the same. i couldn't find a single spicy ingredient to help the ketchup... i mean, salsa... that i found at the store. at least i had taco shells. jacopo liked it anyway, sort of. we all agreed it was pathetic. not that we all didn't expect as much. ludo wouldn't eat it at all, wouldn't even try it. she didn't miss anything. she ate pate and bread instead. so european. the shadows are getting long. i think i might take a break here from the computer and catch up on the news. on the tv down here, there's a few channels that are either in english or give you an option of which language you can watch it in. like last night, i watched "high fidelity" again on a movie channel and switched it to english from italian dubbing. fabrizio even sat down and watched some of it with me. i hid the remotes so that ludo couldn't grab them and switch it to the disney channel, a regular occurence everytime i'm watching tv. she bitched. but i never watch tv here. i decided i would for once. she ended up cuddling with me on the couch anyway and watching it although she didn't understand 90% of it. even watched tv with jacopo last night. a football game he was looking forward to. so we bonded, just a little bit. but i feel it was important, ludo in her room and me and jacopo doing something together, groaning at the same missed shots and dirty fouls. it was a good time. talk to y'all later on. happy sunday. --charlotte 12.17.2001 well that was a successful little outing. you know, the american expression "money talks" sure does apply throughout the world. actual words aren't important, so long as you're ready to pay. so i bought myself a CD today at the little music shop in the old part of town, tucked away down an allyway no bigger than ten feet across. yes, a CD. probably the first one i've actually paid for in a year or two. CD burners, folks. and i was reminded why... the little sucker cost me 39.000 lire. twenty bucks. a christmas present to myself. oh, it's the coldplay CD "parachutes." i dig them! a british band. the CDs the store are all locked up. you have to ask to get it out. point and click style. well, it's a little after one, so i may be kicked off shortly. the moms comes home from work usually around this time. we'll see how long this little session lasts. observation: the public transit system. the acronym here for the bus system is SAD, short for god knows what. something blarringly ironic when you look at the faces of those on board. i guess public transit is depressing in any city. another joke to myself... the little store down the road, the one i shop at because 1. it's close, and 2. it's the only one i'm brave enough to go into. i don't have to speak really, not like the ones where you're being waited on by an actual human being to get what you're looking for. well, the name of the store chain is "DESPAR"... which i can't help but see it to be DESPERATE when i walk in. hey, i gots to have my beer and gnocchi. even if it does mean shopping in silence, praying for as little of an interaction as humanly possible to get the deed done. yes, desperate i am. looking for english wherever i go. speaking fo which, i think i'll give anna a call today. it would be a hoot to have a drink with her, speak in english with a native speaker. i realise though that it's the week before christmas (have i really been here that long?!). i'd expect that she's pretty busy like everyone, work, shopping... blood greasing the capitalist machinery of the western world. you know, christmas time! at least the holiday seems to be less about "things" here than it is at home. still, it's a crunch to wind down your obligations in time for vacation. we'll see what she's up to. i'm dying to pick her brain. i'm curious to see how this family does the whole christmas holiday thing. is the night before an event? do they go to church at midnight? no american football games on TV the day of. i may be lost this year. at first, i envisioned myself withdrawing to my flat, not wanting to intrude on such a family-oriented time. but i don't want to depress myself. maybe i'll prepare some sappy speech, a toast to world peace, get all teary-eyed and dripping with sentiment. maybe i'll just play it by ear... like almost everything i do here. watch and act accordingly. so, here's the question: do i get something for the folks for christmas? probably not, right? i don't know, and i don't want to get stuck feeling like a jackass if i blow it off. i got the kids something. and the gift giving really seems to be about the kids. what do y'all think? all things considered, i mean. i'm not their "friend" so i'm not obligated, right? hm. a bottle of moet chandon? a lump of coal? marital counciling? ok, that was messed up. i'm just feeling playful. ok. i out to go upstairs and make myself a little breakfast. gotta go pick up ludo in an hour. thanks to those of you who've been calling and mailing. i miss you all!! --charlotte 12.18.2001 "i'll take 'busted' for 300, Alex." wooaaa... was last night ever awkward! i'm giggling about it now, but it sure wasn't funny last night. where to begin... ok, so manuela went out again for a spell last night before dinner, not coming back until around 7:45. Fabrizio came home to find jacopo getting dinner started (i asked to help him, but he said he had it under control). words were exchanged, i heard my name in there, and then the voices escalated. i could figure out the words at least "where's your mother?" but i could be wrong. what i gathered is that fabrizio was upset that jacopo was doing what manuela should have been, or at least me (but no one asked, so i take no responsibility for remaining on the couch with ludo). big deal, dinner is late. oh, but more was going on. way more. when manuela returned, a fight insued. thank god i don't know italian. not that i can't read a silent film. it was brief, but both parents were all bent out of shape for the rest of the night. dinner on the table, and all i could do was stare at something to disappear into myself. manuela sat at her place, somewhat slumped forward with her head in her hand looking... hm. a mixture of defeat, irritation. she refused to eat anything, hardly speaking except to decline offers by the kids to eat something before they finished it. the cell rang twice (her's of course), and both times she got up from the table to answer it, shutting a bedroom door behind her for privacy. fabrizio usually speaks to me at dinner. to get the conversation rolling in english or at least to connect for a bit. not last night. not a word from him in my direction. when i got up to bring my first plate into the kitchen, helping him as he took eveyone else's, i tried to get a glimpse of what his face could tell me. i mean, should i leave? i can fully manage on my own, folks. i don't need to be here if it's a bad time!! i looked him in the eyes for a split second with a subtle expression of "what's the deal" in mine. and nothing. not even the slightest gesture or waivering of that serious stare he held to throughout the meal. i guess that told me plenty. yikes! right? dinner was over, i started the dishes. fabi brought some dishes in from the table, i aksed him if i should go. he said no like he was surprised that i'd ask. owkay. then he was gone, i heard the bedroom door lock. ludo back to the vortex of television watching. like i've said before, an air raid siren wouldn't disturb her fixation. jacopo back to his room, a shutting of doors throughout the house. which left me and manuela. and for the first time since i've been here, she helped me with the clean up. maybe she needed to busy herself. maybe she wanted the company, although i doubt it. i'd put my money on the former. i took out the trash, and when i returned... ok, it wasn't like the same pot she was cleaning, but i'd already done all the cleaning. she was still at the sink. and taking the trash means going downstairs, out the builing, out the gate, then down the street to the dumpster. had a cigarette... five minutes, maybe ten. when i came back in, and saw her standing there alone... i don't know, guys. you all know how i feel about this woman. she's not my candidate for mother of the year. but seeing her there, obviously very distracted, troubled... i can't help but feel compasssion. i came up to her, put my hand on her shoulder and asked her if she's alright. and although i wasn't expecting her to say anything in response, she did. she stopped what she was doing, turned around and looked at me. "charlotte, i'm just very... nervous." then she turned around again and grabbed something else to wash out. i put the table cloth back in its place, returned the centerpiece to the table, and made one more pass through the kitchen to see that everything had been done. she turned to me again to let me know that i could go now if i wanted to. ah, yes... that would be good. so i grabbed my coat and my cell, stopping back into the kitchen one more time. i asked her one more time, "are you sure you're ok?" i asked almost in a whisper. she gave me a yes with a forced positivity. i wasn't pressing for a confessional, just trying to show her that i care. which i know she understood. out of nowhere, maybe remembering the little note i drew out to myself that hangs in my kitchen upstairs to help myself get along here, i said the words "you're loved." once upon a time, my dear friend jennifer sent me a picture of a curly haired smiley face in a picture frame with those words drawn at the bottom. i still have it at home, and i made one for myself when i got here to help keep my head up. simple words, but they mean a lot to me. saying that to her elicited a kind of "yeah, right" huff and a forced smile. it was time to go. it was time as soon as she got home, really. but now i went, eager to leave the discomfort of problems that aren't mine. i feel for these people, you guys. they're flawed, frustrating... and every bit as human as they come. i know that i can't really help them but to stay out of the way and do my duties. i /know/ i can't help them, not with big stuff. but when i'm this close to someone else's pain and i have love to spare, it's all i can do to offer it if it's wanted. hm... i'm not giggling anymore. ok, on to other things. what other things? i still haven't called anna. last night didn't seem the time to ask fabrizio for her number. i don't have any grand designs for the day. just looking out the window at the passing airplanes, criss-cross patterns of clouds streaming behind them, then vanishing. adieu, charlotte 12.19.2001 hello again, everyone. i suppose the fact that i've nothing substantial to write about is a blessing after the turmoil of monday night. nevertheless, i'll keep you all posted on what's up. ludo and i went out shopping last night, really to buy food for dinner. but while we were out, i was able to secure a little christmas presento for the folks. yep, real creative... a bottle of moet chandon. it was the best the store had (that i recognized), so i went for it. i'm not totally confident seeing as though it's not white star, the particular moet chandon that i'm used to buying. ha! listen to me, like i'm really used to buying $25 bottles of champagne. it ought to be good though. got it wrapped last night before manuela came home, and it's resting peacefully under the tree. fabrizio never made it home last night. maybe he was working extra late, who knows. maybe he didn't want to be here. both scenarios i can understand. i spent the evening here, long enough to make dinner for me and the kids while manuela soaked in the bathtub. again, she wasn't interested in eating with us. so i made tacos (tried to) to eat with jaco and a burger for ludo who refuses to eat mexican. thank god for tabasco. for the first time since my arrival, i actually got my nose to run from spice. the kids watched in horror as i consumed about 3oz of the stuff. jaco ate a little, then rushed to the freezer for ice as soon as the meal was over. he tried to be a man about it, pretending he was enjoying it. i laughed at him, of course. damn italian gringos! some good news. perhaps. manu let me know yesterday that she received an email from a friend/coworker of mine about possibly coming out here to do the same thing as i am with another family. ok, true. this is a friend of manuela's, so who knows what she'd be in for. i sent the offer to her when i first got here, still unaware of the trials and tribulations of this whole dynamic. actually, i sent the invitation to her sister (also a coworker), seeing as though she's fluent in italian. but she can't do it. so she mentioned her sister, an even cooler chick by my standards. i don't know about her language skills. but just having someone here that i know would be so so excellent. i didn't get much information out of manuela. she only mentioned it in passing, not even an inquiry into what kind of a person i think she is, how i know her. anything. just that she received an email, and she'd talk to her friend again. i guess i've grown to expect such fantastic communication. well, it's wednesday, which means i'll probably be taking ludo to balletto tonight. now that i know what i'm in for, it shouldn't be the nightmare that was last week. this time i'll know to bring my gloves, something to read, etc. there's something about resentment that seems to make sitting in the cold feel just a little bit colder. man, was i pissed last week. ok, here's a sight that i won't be able to get over. old ladies in full length furs and matching hats weaving through traffic on bicycles. that to go along with all the tiny dogs in sweaters. ugh, i'm tired. i was awakened early (9am) this morning by crowd noise, cheers, and whistle blowing. no, it wasn't saturday morning soccer games at the local school. i finally wrenched myself out of bed and pulled up the shades to see what was going on. oh, only the entire high school marching down my street. i couldn't read the banners, obviously. protesting? celebrating? who the hell knows... all i know is that it was loud. and damnit, i need my beauty sleep! at least i'm discovering some interestingly good new music. manuela brought home a killer compilation CD last night and put it on. a kind of retro mix of stuff someone made for her. i would have told her i like it, but whatever. she doesn't much care for my opinions. a taste, you say? Luz Azul by Aterciopelados Slow Down by Incognito and some other stuff... not at all italian. it's great! italian music kind of sucks. as mary wilke would say, "it's completely derivitive." (ok, maybe bryan is the only one out there who'll get that) i am compiling a list of the worst italian songs i hear for your listening pleasure when i get home. yes, the needle will be a-scratchin'. you know, it would be fantastic to go out shopping today. unlike the states, there's hardly anyone out shopping. stores aren't open until mid afternoon in some cases. the real problem is that i've yet to get paid for my time here. the deal was 500bucks a month. which i can imagine meant once a month i'd be paid. but on friday, it will have been a month, and still no mention of it. ok, i'm not exaclty worried that i'm going to get stiffed. i wouldn't allow it to happen. but i sure as hell hope i don't have to bring it up. talk about awkward. but if dad is driving a new carera turbo... i'm sure he can handle a measly 1.000.000 lire. alright. gotta get out of here before the clouds converge and the lightning starts to strike. yes, it's appraoching the one o'clock hour when the moms returns from work. i can feel the wind pick up already. thanks for all your wonderful emails, you guys! i look forward to hearing from you!! it's my favorite part of the day! 12.19.2001 hi again. yep, this is definitely a compulsive habit of mine. can you tell? it's my only real means of communication. i just have to write to y'all. another easy night at the house. call me insecure, but i get nervous when i have to cook here and the parents haven't left yet. ok, so they're snobbish anyhow. and i don't take imperfection lightly. so i've got two elements working against me. i grilled up some steaks (indoors! don't get excited. there isn't a BBQ in all of bolzano), made some gnocchi with butter and grana, and a salad. simple, trouble free. all the while, the folks are busy getting ready. not together, of course. manu gets ready first. knee-length white skirt with some kind of black flower thing happening on it, knee-high black boots with heals, a shiny black tank top, tight as they come, and a black leather jacket. and too much make-up, par for the course. she looked good, sure. but so much vanity! relax... understated looks so much sexier. so then she goes out. she actually came up to me in the kitchen to tell me goodbye, a beeming smile on her face. i told her to have fun, that she looks great, all that good stuff. then she's off. now fab gets up and goes into the bedroom to get ready. black turtleneck, black slacks, black shoes. this guy is so good looking... the few of you who met him know this. he throws on a floor-length black coat, grabs his cell, and then he's off, i think to hang out with his best friend who he usually goes out with on wednesday nights. so it's me and the kids again. jaco playing nintendo, ludo drawing and watching TV... and me at my usual post at the laptop. 30 minutes til freedom. ok, here's something i find interesting. i just gotta tell. manuela has been busying herself for a while now with this charity function she's putting on. for a foundation called "peter pan" -- which benefits kids in alto-adige who have cancer. she and a few others put together a calander to sell, the money from which goes to help. they're kicking off the sales at a reception she's organizing at this bar/café/restaurant down the street. nice, right. well, i saw the finished project tonight. guess what the cover shot is!? a black and white, grainy photograph of HER and her four friends. kinda james dean like, leaning up against a fence, all of them in b&w, her with her arms crossed looking real cool. can you imagine? this is for kids with cancer, and she thinks it's a good idea to put her own goddamed picture on the cover? what a selfless act, manuela! merry christmas! the calendar as a whole is a montage of mediocre photographs. it's titled "details" with pictures of... a woman's butt wearing a thong, some chicks breasts in a corset, manuela's neck and shoulders, someone's belly... all in b&w. besides the pictures being shakey in terms of artistic merit, what i really can't get over is the cover. and then on the back... is the same set of chicks from behind. ludo's leaning over my shoulder to point out which butt belongs to her mom. is this the weirdest scene? or am i just cracking up!? oh yes, in about a 10 point font on the back of the calander is the name of the foundation. like, "oh yeah! it's for the kids!" an afterthought once our egos have been satisfied. i remember now about a week ago when manu was complaining of how hard it is to get it all finished, how no one else invovled was helping her, only criticising. i responded to her, "oh well, at least you feel good that your energy is going towards helping kids who need it." i doubt that was ever part of the plan. why, this is about me!! charity events are a fashionable accessory to my bourgois lifestyle!! oh, i'm buying one of these suckers, you guys. don't worry! you'll all get to see it!! anyone up for a late christmas present? ok, ok... i just had to dish that little bit. i'd better get ludo into bed now. -c 12.20.2001 hi again, all. i had a moment of panic this morning when i came down here to email. the DSL line wasn't connecting (it's not on all the time like i'm used to it being at home)!!! i thought maybe the puter was broken. desperate, i went upstairs to write in my journal. i just had to write! but here i am, and i'm connected. in every way. guess what!? i spoke to anna on the phone this afternoon! i was expecting a machine (she warned me that it's in german), to say something devastatingly cleaver, all that good stuff. but no! she was actually at home, getitng ready to go to a christmas party for the school she teaches at part time. we talked, more than i'd expected actually. i'm not much of a fan of the phone. but hey. i'll take it how it comes. we chatted about the family. nothing major, but i can tell that she's an eye for the obvious. she mentioned going away to austria for the weekend, and that she wanted to call me on monday morning to go for a coffee. yippie!! i can't wait!! not much to relay. mom is home, kids are home. i could use a bath or something equally soothing. too bad!! maybe i could work it out. we'll see. ok. maybe i'll be inspired to write more later. i sure was this morning! damned Telecom Italia. charlotte 12.21.2001 friday morning... more importantly, today marks the end of my first month here in italy. can you believe i've been here that long? well, it sometimes seems like it has been a year. some days groan on like neverending blocks of consciousness. some go by quickly... just like real life i suppose. last night got me in a tizzy. don't worry, as pissed as i was, i kept my ventilation to a private session. today, i don't even feel like addressing it. i feel defeated, shit on. and a little sad. maybe if i let myself cry today, it'l help to let go of how angry i was last night, give me perspective. i can tell that my emotional needs are screaming for attention. it's better to digest my feelings with myself first before i bring it up with the culprit. anger is so unattractive. so again i'm home alone with the kids. this /is/ like every night. i served dinner for the kids, a little more impatient with ludo than usual. she has a habit of asking me to put things away for her when it's so much less of an effort for her to just do it herself. like i know where everything goes. and like i'm not doing anything with my arms a foot deep into the dishes or something. i wanted to go home last night in a big way. i was in a bad mood, thinking about christmas and how much i'm going to miss the entire thing. it was the first time i'd actually exhibited some frustration around here. guess i'm getting comfortable if i'm not just holding it all in for me to chew on. i wasn't a bitch, but come on ludo! have some independence... at least while i'm already obviously not in the position to drop everything just to put your shoes in your room. ah, kids. i finished with the dishes, manu got home, she told me to go. no, i didn't ask, nor do i think she knew that i was feeling funky. she doesn't pay that close of attention. she just told me to go. but to come back in an hour! it was already 20 minutes to 9, the hour when the kids are in bed. but she was going out AGAIN, and she wanted me here for some reason. i usually leave by the time she wanted me to come back. but whatever! i don't ask why. ok. i left. i slipped into my pajamas, made myself some tea, tried to busy myself with cleaning out some more of the shit that was left in the flat by the last tennant. watching the clock, not able to wind down with the knowledge that i still had to be "on" later that night. so i grab a book, my jounal, some CDs and my headphones, brush my hair, and leave my place. i open the door, the sound of the lock startles manuela who's laying on the couch watching TV. oh! her plans changed! she's not leaving until later, so she tells me to leave again! no phone call to give me a heads up, no effort to use a little foresight into whether it's really necessary to keep me on call for nothing. no, just a wave of the hand indicating the door. god damn it, i hate being disrespected. i went upstairs, ditched my pjs, put on a million layers of clothes, grabbed my journal and my smokes and went outside. i was furious. ok, so i realise it's not /that/ big of a deal in the grand scheme of the universe. but you know, it's indicative of an attitude she has with me. and with all the dirty little bits about her that i'm picking up, trying desperately not to hold them against her, i'm reaching a point where my attitude in response is getting /really/ hard to contain. patience, patience, patience.... ack! no, the building lights did not go on that night to tell me she'd left. i can see the illumination from where i sit to write and smoke. and i was out there, scribbling furiously in the dark, for about an hour. i exhausted myself enough to fall quickly asleep when i went back upstairs. thank god. the last thing i would have wanted is to be lying awake pissed off. you guys, i'm so so frustrated. i know this whole situation is difficult for all of us involved here at the house. i'm fine with submerging my identity more or less to fit into a new environment. i'm doing my absolute best to make this whole scenrio a good one. but the way i'm being treated... it's bullshit. at every turn, i'm smiling and composed. i go out of my way to anticipate the needs of the folks here. i do a good job with the kids. their english, the reason i'm here!, is totally improving. i'd expect that with all that going on, i'd be earnign a little respect around here. i feel like a piece of shit!! ok, now i'm sad. it's just so fucking disappointing. what can i do to be taken seriously? just because i'm getting paid to be here doesn't mean i don't have feelings, that i'm not an entire human being within myself no matter how far away from home i am. and by the way, /no/ i haven't been paid yet. maybe they think that by my having financial independence, i'm on a longer leash. maybe they think my big vacation fund, which this trip is not, will last me. that they're spending enough money on me. deep breath. ok. so they don't talk to me. they don't want to get to know me. they see me as an employee of the household. now do y'all see why christmas is going to be so difficult? i mean, i bet you guys can already imagine that much. but to be here with a "less than welcoming" family... the irony is heartbreaking. i'm not sure i want to be here at all. maybe i'll buy a bottle of champagne for me, some traditional christmas time tortalini (yes, that's the traditional fare), and spend it with myself. catch a couple of phone calls. keeping that as an option is going to be my saving grace for the next couple of days. and now i'm thinking... about anna! i have plans to hang out with her on monday morning. i can just see manuela asking me to cancel becuase the kids are out of school, and /of course/ that means that my mornings are no longer my own. she hasn't communicated with me what it's going to be like with the kids at home all day. and of course, that begins tomorrow! god, have a conversation with me that isn't last minute! am i going to be here all day, all week long until they go back at the end of their 2 week break? or am i off? do i get a holiday? the only free days i've had have been announced to me in the middle of that day. no chance to plan anything, like a nice long walk into the hills with my backpack full of picnic gear. i've been waiting to get to do something like that since i got here. all this boils down to one thing-- shitty communication. and i think i'm deciding as i sit here that i'm going to force that to change or die trying. i'm unhappy here, and it's the only solution to getting my needs met. i'm not going to wait for their agenda to fall out of the sky on top of me. i want to know what's going on! i'm going to be as diplomatic about this as possible. i mean, as possible as what i'm capable of. i think the best thing to do is to schedule a meeting with them. oh god! can they handle the structure of it all? really though, i think it's time for a tete-a-tete to discuss some things. maybe their expectations of me, mine of them... a reality check for things that they're not used to just explaining to me when they come up. i've been here for a while now, and i still haven't had the courtesy of an explaination of what it is they want from me. and don't want from me for that matter. am i meeting their needs? am i doing an adequate job? if this were a traditional job, i'd expect my boss to sit down and talk to me about my progress, the company's expectations of my work, all that good stuff. i know that this isn't the same. but i need the structure. i need to know what they want from me. and i need to set some guidelines for what i'm willing to take. god, this is hard. why am i here? what the hell did i commit to? can i handle this for two more months if nothing changes? they're not going to magically become conversant with me. manuela is not going to suddenly dismount from her high horse to relinquish her power position. what do i think can be said to even make an impact on what's happening? is it worth admitting that i feel disrespected when i know it's not going to influence anything? these folks are how they are, and my pointing it out is hardly going to change that. only alienate me further by expressing that i see it, and i don't like it. myabe i won't talk to them. maybe this is all on me. all up to me. can i make this a good experience for myself? change my expectations of the situation to make it successful? sure, i'm in italy. big deal! the romanticism of spending time in europe has all but worn away. what i am is far far away from a life with people who treated me a lot better than this. and because i had the power to discriminate as to what i'd take and what i wouldn't, whose bullshit was worth enduring and whose wasn't. here, i don't have that ability. am i spoiled? am i being immature to think i can always be that picky? should i just buck up and let the callus develop until it doesn't bother me anymore? it would be a completely different story if along with their questionable attitude towards me there was something bright and sunny to temper it. what are they really offering me in return for what i'm so freely giving them? i took out my return flight tickets last night to look them over. one month down, two to go. i don't know if i can do this today. maybe i'll feign illness. nah, too pussy. i need to get out. not out of the house necessarily. i just need a break. just for a little while, i need to feel ... normal. recharge. remember who i am, concentrate on the person i know is in there but can't be heard or expressed. feel appreciated! you know, never once have i heard anything from the parents along the lines of "hey, thanks for all you're doing here!" or "hey, good job!" or even an acknowledgement that i'm a decent person, in any way. and i'm not expecting that to come across in spoken language. today sucks. sorry if this has become a bit... i don't know... like something i'm writing to myself in my journal rather than an email to you all. i don't know what else to do with my feelings. my thoughts. my perspective here. until i have a better idea, i think i'll go for a walk. even though i don't want to. i want to stay in my bed all day and be emotional. maybe it'll pass before i have to go get ludo from school. sorry to be a downer. can't help it today. -c 12.23.2001 ok, you all. i'm not sure how this email is going to come out, seeing as though what's really important to mention i'm hesitant to, just in case my brother wants to be the one to say it. so i won't... but that's all i'm thinking about. but i'll fill you in on the rest of the scoop of what's happening here in bolzano. last night i went to a football game in verona. chievo verona vs. roma. (0-3) jaco was sullen and withdrawn, as usual. too bad for him because the rest of us were having a blast. he loosened up once his team started winning. on the way to verona, an hour drive away (which at the rate italians drive with no speed limits is pretty far), i had a chance to talk to fab. not about too much, but i was able to voice my desire to have a little state of the union between us now that i've been here for a month. i brought it up real casually, like as a chance to chat about what's working, what isn't. he thought it was a great idea, even outlining his availability for the next week to make sure we can have it happen. perfect. i even earned a world traveler badge of courage last night at the game that i think i just have to make a public announcement about. call me sheltered, but were you aware that the little girl's room at the stadiums here are nothing more than holes in the floor? i stood there for /just/ a second contemplating if i could hold it for another two hours. i peed, damn it! in a hole in the ground! boy scouts have nothing on me. things are shaping up. looks like i'll be going out of town for part of the christmas holiday. tomorrow i go to coffee with anna. after that, i thknk we're all going out of town to the extended family function. not really looking forward to that. but fab wants me there. i even asked him, or told him rather, that i understand completely if he wants part of his christmas spent just with is family. he said no way... so i'm a- going along. then on christmas day, we're going to have lunch with fab's parents... and then hang out here i think. i'm not totally sure, but he did tell me what was going on. ah, it's amazing what a little communication can do. i feel much better. even if i do wish i was spending this time with my family. this somehow seems horribly incomplete without my brother's news to add to it. but as a courtesy to him, i'll have to wait a few days until i know y'all know. love to all... and in case i don't get a chance to check my mail in the next day or two.... merry christmas! -c 12.24.2001 hi, y'all. well, it's christmas eve here in italy. you all are probably still sleeping as i write. lucky you. i wouldn't mind a nap before the evening's festivities begin. in fact, the parents are each holding down a piece of furniture in a state of sleep. pops in the bed, manu on the couch. me and ludo are hanging out, making bracelets together. jaco's playing play station games with a friend... it's down time at the prada's. i got the play you bought for me from amazon.uk, mom. thanks! i read it this afternoon already. funny character sketches, quirky, very british. it's called "sunday morning at the centre of the world" by de bernières in case the rest of you are wondering what i'm talking about. thanks, mom! it seems the packages sent from within europe make it here a lot quicker than those sent from the states. i finally got dad's sweater about midweek. the present i asked chris to help me find for ludo still hasn't shown up yet, so i had to go out and get her another so she'll have something from me tomorrow. like she minds... two presents instead of one! being christmas, i'm sure there's a huge extra burden on the post systems everywhere. tonight we go to the extended family's place for dinner and traditional hoopla. should be a good time. tomorrow will be even more fun, opening presentos and all. we're hanging here after having lunch with fab's mom and dad. the whole family seems different today, happier, more interconnected. it's good to see, even touching. i mean, sure. i paint the picture of closed bedroom doors and separated sleep. but at lunch today, they actually sat down together, laughed, talked with each other without a certain someone yelling. ludo and jaco are so excited for christmas. i'd forgotten how being around children makes the holidays so much brighter. so last night i went for a run. this time not so far in case i got myself sick in the cold and put a big damper on my christmas. when i got home, i took a shower and crashed. and missed anna's phone call!! true, she wasn't supposed to call until this morning. but when i woke up (early so as to make sure i got the call), the phone told me i had two missed calls. and she didn't call me this morning. so i know it was her. bummer! i hung around my place until noon just in case. no call. no coffee. i suppose i expected as much. it is, after all, christmas eve. and she was spending the weekend in austria. she might not have come back in time or had too much else to do before tomorrow. i'm not too disappointed. but i am a bit tired. this is the first time the whole trip that i've woken up before nine. i played video games with apo, read a play, make a bracelet with ludo, let her paint my toenails blue... did nothing active today at all. so maybe i'm just feeling lazy. and i'm missing my family and my pals!! i guess it's about 8am out there. everyday, all day, i look at my watch, subtract nine from the time, and try to imagine what you all are doing. i'd love to hear from you all... i'll check my mail tomorrow without a doubt. ok... time to run upstairs, take a shower and make myself presentable. not much to relay... not too much fueling my creative fire today. merry christmas, guys. you're in my thoughts. -c 12.25.2001 well, i'm hiding out in ludo's room while the family does their deal in the living room. a melange of italian voices streaming through a closed door. it's true, the sterotype of loud voices, everyone speaking over each other at once. i thought i'd slip away to be alone with the puter for a bit, let them have their time together. not that my being in the room changes the course of conversation or its content. far be it for me to understand 1% of what's being said. last night was a good one. got to see one of the family members car collection, including a brand new ferrari (bright yellow) and a lamborghini (orange) with the biggest engine i'd ever seen. got to sit in the driver's seat while a proud owner revved the engine. what a roar! me and jacopo went to check them out. he acted unimpressed, very cool. i razzed him about his composure, and he beemed. i love that kid. just wish i could reach him more often. we ate planty of food, drank a ton of champagne... the meal was this: hand made tortalini in broth first, then a cold lobster, shallot, carrot, and celery salad, then a similar salad but with octopus, then baked muscles, then steamed salmon, then (isn't this crazy?) a plate of steamed veggies, then a traditional salad, then a fruit plate... it was all fantastic. after the meal, a commotional outside got up all to turn around to face the backyard. a young man about my age was out there with a baton lit on fire, twirling it alla cirque du soleil. then breathing fire! it was super cool... the kids were screaming with delight. when he finished, he came in to make balloon animals and juggle. very charming. desert was also great. two of those holiday log things, a rolled up cake about two feet long each. one was apricot, the other chocolate. i drank lambusco after the champagne was going dry, then a lemon liquor thing that was nearly frozen... very good. there were about 25 people there in total. a very cool family, all in good spirits. even manuela was sentimental. and today too. i came downstairs when called upon, greeted with smiles, hugs and kisses by all (except jaco). we opened presents, had lunch (again, tortalini in broth, this super salty and fatty sausage type thing, mashed potatoes, salad, a goat cheese, red wine, and of course acqua frizzante), and then some more of the family made it over here. there's about ... 15 people over here right now. as if that wasn't bad enough in terms of the noise, guess whose grandparents bought ludo a little drum set and a microphone? ah! calgon, take me away! i've got t.p. in my ears. so manu and company bought me a bottle of perfume, the one she wears... i'd mentioned how yummy it is. miracle by lancome. and a fuzzyish vest. in return, i gave them champagne. and gifts for the kids. it's been a good time. i'm elated to have had such a beautiful time this christmas, amidst worries of alienation and depression setting in being so far from home. but no, in fact just the opposite has occured. i'm feeling happier and more welcomed here than ever before. as i wrote in the card i gave to the parents with the champagne, i love each of them more every day i'm here. today definitely qualifies that statement. ok... it looks like my stint at the computer is reaching its end. i have kids looking over my shoulder, drums being banged on two feet away. time to pretend to be participating in conversation again. i love you all so so much! please, have a safe holiday. and a fun and loving one! much love, charlotte 12.26.01 a quiet day, overcast and freezing. the steets are empty, the town deserted. i went for a long walk this morning, hoping to find life returning to normal after the christmas holiday. only to discover that this too is a holiday. nothing is open except for coffee shops. i felt like hiding out today anyway. no phone calls or knocks at the door from the family, so i spent the better part of the day alone in my flat, reading, writing, watching more of the same ridiculous videos on MTV italia. i tried to nap but couldn't. i did some laundry by hand just for something to do. with a rush of nervousness, i went ahead and knocked at their door to see if the computer could be mine for a moment or two. no post today. i'm dying for a delivery. i think i have about ten films on their way, a couple of CDs, a book or two... now that the family bought a new VCR/DVD player for christmas, i can finally return to my natural state as a movie hound. i watched two last night, seeing as though no one was in the living room. "american beauty" - so great everytime i see it. and i always see something new in the shots that adds dimention to its brilliance. and "nights of cabiria" - a classic that always touches me. and it's italian, dontchaknow. manuela stood there and watched part of it for maybe two minutes before sighing and walking away looking bored. i'd rather watch films with people, but i'm quite used to the solitude, the private voyeurism of watching alone. i'm kind of glad she left me. what a shapeless day. the sky is grey, no chance of rain or of any other character developing in the weather. there isn't even any breeze. no one is out walking. it would be a good day to make some french onion soup... if only the stores were open to buy provisions. as it stands, i've barely enough food upstairs to make a meal out of it. ture, i can eat whatever i want down here. but i want to cook alone, play soft music and do something creative. maybe i'll hijack a couple of onions and bullshit my way through some soup after all. fab's sleeping. jaco is playing video games. i expect this is manu and ludo coming in the door right now. nope, it's jaco's pal, marco. a little pink cheeked german-looking kid. he's nice... makes an effort to say hello. i'm wondering... now that the kids are out of school, am i free? the structure of my responsibilities are as up in the air as ever. can i take some time now to plan a little excursion, albeit by foot, into the hills? can i make plans with anna without attaching a tentative footnote? speaking of anna, she didn't call sunday night. that was luis, my friend in san diego. poop! not only did i miss talking to him, a dear friend. but she flaked. hm. little investment, little lost. still, it's a touch disappointing all around. today is for reflection and recharging. i'm finally becoming more and more aware of how this trip is affecting me, changing me. i can see it in myself now, my composure steadying, my mind quieting, my perspective broadening. i'm feeling hesitant about returning to america, anticipating the estangement from what used to be so familiar. it's not something i can pin down exactly. more of a vague sense of separation. i suppose that means i'm growing more comfortable with my italian lifestyle. i really do like it here. i'm not quite finished connecting words to this line of thinking, so i apologize if it seems to just hang out there unsubstantiated. i'm not sure what it is i'm trying to say. or maybe it makes perfect sense to everyone but me. i guess rereading what i just wrote makes sense enough, but it seems somehow incomplete. as is the process that's underway. in addition to the incredibly generous amazon.uk gift certificate i got from my aunt paula and uncle pete for christmas, their holiday greeting included a very interesting proposal. they're planning their spring break travel, and are wondering if i'd have any inkling to join them in istanbul. not constantinople. (sorry, i can't help myself... that song comes up whenever i hear the word) would i ever! they're not sure so far exactly where they're going. maybe to paris, maybe stopping by bolzano. but istanbul... now /that/ would be a culture shock! yahoo! bring it on! i'll have to work out the details, whether i can afford it, yadda-yadda- yadda. how cool of an invitation is that? i'd so love to travel outside of the western world, with the safety net of folks i know, love, and trust. pete has been there before. an add-on excursion to their africa trip that the two of them went on this summer. an islamic democracy. now /that/ i have to see. well, it's about three o'clock now, and i ought to get some laundry started... the big things that can't be washed by hand and still hang to dry within a week's time. i feel like buying them a dryer. it's so silly not to have one. you have to like /plan ahead/. keep the emails coming, you guys. i love to hear from all of you. much love, charlotte 12.27.2001 greetings, all. not much to report on around here. i thought i'd make the most of my being broke and spend time on the computer rather than doing the shopping i was hoping would happen today. the stores are all open finally after yesterday's saint stephano haitus. however, i'm down to about 30 bucks in lire, and that's not going to get me very far. i wish fab was around this afternoon so i could bring up the money issue. after all, i'd be fine financially if i got paid already. the sky is so clear and bright, it reminds me of a santa ana in san diego summers. only it's freezing. i went for a long walk again this morning, stopping at DESPAR for some snacky things and some beer for later. good thing beer is cheap, or i'd really be bummed about the cash flow situation. when i got home, i started another little writing project. a screenplay that i've been wanting to write for a long time. i stopped myself about an hour into it though, seeing as though i'd only have to transcribe it later onto a computer. and i dunno... i just wanted something creative to do. the muse is not with me today. nor am i experienced enough with screenwriting to just b.s. my way through it until inspiration strikes. the day is mine once again. or at least i think that's the case. do you really think they'd all-of-a-sudden start to tell me what their plans are out of nowhere? i'm left to guess. i coudl ask, ok. and i will, as soon as i don't need anything else down here and can take my dismissal and leave for the rest of the day. i'm anticipating anna's call at some point. that's the only thing on my agenda. to wait for a phone call that may never transpire. ugh. i had nightmares last night that i kept missing the ring on my phone, that i'd look at it agian and again and it said "3 missed calls." guess i'm a little miffed at having to wait by the phone for life to come to me, like a despondant teenager waiting to see if little johnny will call today. it's a slowed down version of life around here. i wish i had more ocntrol over some things. ok, again... i could call /her/! but i already made the first move. i'd love to watch the film that arrived in the mail for me today. "deconstructing harry", the allen film from a couple of years ago. it's so funny! but i know there's little to no chance that it'll happen with the house full of folks. i'll have to wait until the place is empty so i can sneak some time in the living room. i'm thinking about the premise and trying to relate it to what's going on here. harry block (how's that for a name?) writes book, a thinly veiled account of his friends and family, and ends up pissing everyone off. can you imagine what would happen if the folks got their hands on what i've written in these emails? what would happen if i actually did do something with my account of this time here and they ended up reading it? i'd be toast. manu especially would be pissed. she already can't stand me. and it's not as if i've drawn a glowing portait of her charm and compassion. well, i'm being edged off the computer here by ludo. and making me cranky for the lack of consideration. think i'll grab my phone and keys and take off now. 12.29.2001 well, you all. i would have been more diligent about keeping you all up to date. however, things aren't going so well over here, and i didn't have the time, the space, the energy to write until now. i think i mentioned to you all that i proposed to fab that we sit down and have a tete-a-tete this week to talk about the state of things. a proposal that he enmbraced, although nothing has happened since then. nor have i gotten paid... and i'm down to about 20 bucks because of it. i figured i would have been paid by now. and i figured my taking a leap of faith by opening up the lines of comunication would have had some effect. but no. so i asked my dad to jump in to help, just to give a friendly reminder that i needed to be paid snuck in with an inquiry into how things are going. just because it hurt my feelings oh-so much, here's the exchange: Charlotte, I just got this e-mail from Fabrizio. Love... Dad ---------------------- Subject: Re: How are things going?To: jconrad@simssoftware.com Jim, Thanks for your e-mail. I am sorry to tell you that from my perspective things are not going as well as I have imagined. This is something that I am going to discuss with Charlotte in the next days. I just wanted to wait for a while, but after a month it is time to face the situation. By the way, as Charlotte talks to Jacopo very seldom, it is really difficult to see any improvement of his language skill. Regarding the money, in my companies as in the rest of the country, employees are paid monthly and they get money by the tenth day after the end of the month. As Charlotte has begun on the 25th of November, she is going to be paid by the first days of January. By the way, if she had asked for that, she would have got some money without any problem. Best wishes Fabrizio Prada Jim Conrad wrote: Fabrizio, This is just a quick note to say hello and ask you how things are going. We e-mail Charlotte just about every day and call her on the phone every week, but I'd like to hear how things are going from your perspective. From what I've heard from Charlotte, it sounds like she's doing well with Ludo and Jaco regarding their English language skills. By the way, I note from Charlotte that she still hasn't been paid for her services. The agreement that I remember from our meeting was $500 per month and she's already been there five weeks as of tomorrow. While I'm sure that this is just an oversight, not only would I like to see her promptly paid, I think that weekly or bi-monthly payment would be more appropriate, to help her out with her cash flow situation. Regards, Jim Conrad how's that? ok, so the exchange is backwards. but there it is. i'm thinking now that it was a bad idea that i asked my dad to intervene on my behalf... although he hardly said anything earth-shattering. but the tide has turned. fabrizio is not happy with me. not at all. he hardly speaks to me anyway, but last night was a special treat. he was angry. not outwardly. not his style. but i could so tell. and no smile to match mine this morning either. is it getting colder in bolzano, or is it just me? i'm acting as if i never heard his response. or that my dad wrote to him. i don't think he expects that i know what he said to my dad. so i'm playing it cool. and packing my bags quietly in my hovel upstairs. yep, after that information, i decided to take action, exercise my power to leave. even if i haven't yet changed my plane ticket. it feels good to see my luggage back otu in the open, my closet cleared except for a few things. there's no communication in this house. not with me anyway. jaco is one problem. but it can't be solved or even worked on when they can't communicate with me or each other. i've tried my best. you all know how communicative i am. i just don't see this situation improving. jaco isn't going to magically change. i can't force him to take this arrangement seriously. that ain't ma job. i'm not his therapist, and i can't reach him unless he meets me half way. as for the parents, i'm not into being... i can't just assume what they're thinking and let that be sufficient communication. if this were me in their shoes, i'd be monitoring the progress of the situation on a daily basis. making an effort to make it work along side of the instructor. much like a parent would in the realm of regular education. checking homework, ya know? ok. well, the good news is that i'm hanging out with anna this afternoon. there's a lake that's frozen over, and we're going to go ice skating. with shoes, that is. she has skates, i don't. i have to go now though to find out whether i have to bring the kids with me or if i'm free to actually do something alone. more later... -charlotte 12.30.2001 hello again. what a day i had yesterday!! i don't know about you all, but walking across a frozan lake is the coolest thing! anna took me out ice skating, then invited me to hang out at her place for dinner and beers. i had such a good time, playing ice hockey with a little boy about 7 years-old. and talking to anna. and boy did we have a few things to say to each other. first of all, i got the scoop on the situation here in such clear detail. seems anna has know fab for a few years, long enough to be an ear to it all. and she didn't hold out a bit relaying what she knows to me. it all makes so much more sense now. only, now i'm really realising how screwed up the situation is. how numbered my days are. the conversation began with anna telling me this: that when she heard fab tell her that he was having an american nanny come out to stay with them, all she could think about is how this is the /worst/ time in their family history to have such a thing occur. and why exactly? ... manuela has had this boyfriend of hers for quite some time... a couple of years at least. however, it's only since very very recently that she has been "living her separate life." as anna estimates it, about the time that fab returned from the states. this whole red-luggage-by-the-door thing, her leaving every weekend to be with the guy, all this is incredibly recent. a turn for the worse in terms of their family cohesiveness. obviously. anna told me how that manuela has recently undergone a huge image change, losing fifty pounds, becoming a fashion whore. an identity crisis that rivals any i've ever witnessed. mid-life crisis anyone? yep, she's 40, on the dot. too too stereotypical. and as for fab. believe it or not (more to myself than to those of you who don't know him), fab has "come a long way," as anna puts it, from being super controlled to this state. i can't imagine him being any less emotional, any less spontaneous. but as i hear it, he has changed a lot in that sense. and i found out about his lover. a 29 year-old australian woman named catherine who also teaches english like anna does. anna called herself the go-between for their relationship as it began, using her to relay information about each person's feelings for the other. i don't think it's still a situation, but i don't know for sure. anna's name, for a long time, was a dirty word in this house. whether it was because they too had a relationship, i can't be sure. i have no real reason to disbelieve anna's insistence that it wasn't sexual, that she's "completely innocent." but they did hit it off from the beginning, going out together for dinner at least once a week. the threat of another woman was enough to make them have to "cool it" for a while after the heat began to build back at the house. why manu would care if she's doing the same shit only worse, i don't know. sounds like there's more to that than i'm being let in on. anna agrees with me that i'm not their therapist. i can't force jaco to talk to me. and now that i see exactly what's happening to his family, i feel bad for even being here. i can't do a thing to help them. and i'm more than convinced that my being here is actually a hinderence to their healing. they've got a world of shit to deal with. and i'm not the band- aid thay thought i'd be. or rather, that fabrizio thought i'd be. i gather from anna that manuela had nothing to do with the decision of me coming here. no wonder she resents me, disrespects me, all the rest of it. does she see me as her replacement, a ploy by her husband to show her that she's not here enough to take care of her family? does she think i'm here to facilitate their family's unraveling by granting her the freedom (and freedom of conscience) to leave whenever she wants to? either way, their family life is on the brink of disaster if not already there. my being here is a big mistake. and i think fab knows it. like i said earlier, we've yet to sit down and talk. he's still angry with me today, i think. not as bad as the last two days though. and i think he's realising that this turned out to be nothing like what he'd hoped. so again today, i asked him if today was a good day to talk about things, or maybe the next day or two. again, i brought up that we need to discuss things. this, an entire week after the first time i proposed it. and he blew me off, saying "maybe. we'll see." what the fuck?! why is he stalling? how many times do i have to ask? i don't think he wants to talk. and ok, neither do i. the thought of the conversation that needs to take place had me in tears on the phone with my mom last night. but we have to!! i'm not happy. he's not happy for much more significant reasons than i. but there's no use letting more time pass. it's only getting worse. and my patience is wearing so thin, i can hardly stand it. you guys, this is all so sad. my disappointment, sure. i wanted so much that this turned out to be a wonderful experience. but it isn't. i'm hurting. what's worse is having to watch this family come apart... they're in so much pain. and i can't do a thing to help. i don't want to be involved! this isn't my deal! and this is definitely not what was advertised. thank god for anna. she shed more light than i expected. she's such a breath of fresh air, really bright, insightful, happy, funny. i'm so glad i got to spend time with her yesterday. i see why fabrizio has her as his confidante. he talks to her, it's true. which also lets me know that if she was so willing to divulge the truth to me about his situation, i can expect that the same will happen with what i've said to her. no problem. at least he'll find out eventually how i feel, what's going on. and i didn't say anything i regret knowing that it's going to come back to him. so, he's blown it. he turned me down once again to discuss matters. so there's nothing else i can do but to pack my bags. there's no fixing the situation if the problems never get addressed. i plan to be back in san diego in a week or two. phone calls would really help me these days, you guys. or i guess i'll be back soon enough to just sit down and really get to connect with you all. this sucks... i've made up my mind. i'm out of here. -charlotte 12.31.2001 ok, so here's my game plan. and yes, i'm forcing it to happen today. first of all, i'm about to go into jaco's room and have a talk with him. i want him to tell me a few things... like if he really doesn't want me here, or if he's just shy. and maybe i can mention to him that if thinngs don't mprove with our interaction, his dad feels that the situation isn't wokring. and that i may be leaving much sooner than expected. maybe he does have some things to say... don't have anything to lose by confronting him. and next, i'm going to ask fab for some money. i have about ten dollars to my name here right now, and it's bloody new year's eve. i want to go out tonight!! and also, tomorrow i have the whole day off again... and no money and nothing to do. of course, the family is going skiing without me. so at least i'll have the computer for the day. big whoop. thanks for inviting me, fab! after i have a few bucks in my pocket, and hopefully a real portion of my payment if not the whole thing, i'm going to just bring up my dissatisfaction. again, nothing to lose. might as well just force th eissue on him. ok.... well, first thing's first. time to talk to jaco. i couldn't tell ludo that i'm thinking of leaving. she'd flip out. gotta make sure he doesn't tell her, not until it's finalized. email later... -c 1.1.2002 i cannot believe there's no asperine in this house! help!! my head is killing me. but hey, it was worth every bit of the pain i'm in now. i just surfaced from about twelve hours of sleep, and i still feel like crap. somehow we got the order wrong, starting with beer, then wine, then jack daniel's, then champagne. i was having such a good time, i forgot to take it easy on the beverages. so today i'm miserable. but at least i got to go out last night. yep, anna ended up calling me in the afternoon to invite me out with her and eddy, her boyfriend. a small gathering at a friend's new place. fondue, fireworks... so so much alcohol. at first, she told me that she'd like to invite me, but she didn't think she could. i'm so glad it worked out that i could go. i needed to have one crazy night here in bolzano! anna also mentioned to me last night that eddy's sister might want me to be the nanny for her two boys. ha! i don't know if i'd want to... after all of this, i'm kind of over it. but i'll think about it. she can't make a decision for sure for a couple more weeks anyway. i think it might be even more awkward to split my time with two families. or to abandon one for another. still, the offer was nice. man, all i can think about is my hangover. i'd better crawl back upstairs before i'm spotted. the family is out skiing today. manu still in verona. today would /not/ be the best time to have a chat with them. still have to tell you all about my chat with jaco though... before i go. i guess his dad hasn't talked to him at all about the situation, how it's going, none of that. so they're not talking about things either. jaco says he just doesn't want to talk in general, that it has nothing to do with me. so i told him that i know his dad is dissatisfied with the situation of my being here, that he won't talk to me about it though. and that i'm planning on leaving in a week or two because it doesn't seem that things are going to improve. he didn't say much as usual, but he did convey to me that he and his dad say nothing to each other about my being here, his progress, his participation. wonderful. it wasn't like a long talk or anything. i didn't want to overwhelm him. but at least now i have more information. and he knows what's happening. think i may try to get a ticket out of here at the end of next week. still no money for this... i'm afraid i'm going to have to write that off. duh.... i can't sit here any longer. more sleep. water. (grunt) me not happy with head pain. -c 1.3.2002 Decisions have been made, words exchanged, plans arranged. I’m ready to leave. My flight out of here is on January 12th at 4pm out of Verona. Yes, I had a talk with Fabrizio, and yes, it confirmed all the things I foresaw as irreparable within this situation. Let’s start at the conversation’s beginning. First, I approached Fabrizio after he got home from work last night, asked him if we could talk. He said yes, and then just stared at me as I tried to formulate a starting point. True, I wasn’t expecting that he’d break the silence himself to get the ball rolling. But maybe I was hoping he would say something, anything. I started with the money issue, asking him about the situation with payment. Well, he pulled a wad of lire out of his pocket, waved it at me, and said, “here’s your money. And next time don’t go crying to your dad for it!” and threw it down on the table. He was so so angry! And for good reason, I’ll grant him that. I regret having asked my dad to help me out with that. It really got to his sense of pride. But I wasn’t about to have a discussion with him that began with verbal aggression. He went on… “and second? What else do you have to say?” By this time, my eyes were tearing up pretty good. I could only shake my head and tell him, “no. not if you’re going to take that tone.” And I walked away, shutting the door behind me in the bathroom to choke out a few sobs to myself. I thought about leaving, postponing the discussion until the mood was more conducive to actually talking, less emotionally driven. But then I’d already received a call from my dad that evening telling me of my flight change. And anyway, what good would it have done to wait any longer. He’d been storing up this anger for a week already. More time wasn’t going to soothe him. So I came back to try it again after a couple of minutes to gather my composure. He was still hostile with me, and in front of the kids, so I asked him if we could please talk in private, away from his children. We sat down in ludo’s room, shut the door, and had it out for about 15 minutes. I don’t even know how long we were in there. To recount the entire conversation… nah. Not now anyway. Basically though, he feels that I haven’t done my job, that my inability to talk with Jacopo, to reach him, is my fault. That I needed to try harder, force him to do things with me. He thinks I’m too passive around the house, waiting for instructions all the time rather than taking control on my own. Ok, that I agreed with him about. But my explanation to him that I act that way so as to not step on anyone’s toes, that this is their agenda I’m trying to work around, not mine, he didn’t pay any mind to. Like I’m supposed to make all the decisions? I’m treated like an outsider. Why would I think it fit to take the reigns? Anyway, i was able to explain to him that i feel incredibly uncomfortable in their house, the vibes i receive from his wife most of all. he went on to tell me that she feels very uncomfortable around me as well. but would go into why, just left that hanging out there saying i'd have to talk to her about it if i wanted to know. which i don't. i've nothing to say to her really. nothing that will satisfy me as far as walking away feeling any better. i did mention to him, ever so gently, that maybe one of the reasons why jaco isn't talking more is because he's sensing some of the tension that's in this house lately. whoa! that wasn't allowed. he stared at me so intensely, saying, "don't you dare try to mix the two." well, come on, fab. you're a fool to think that just because you don't talk to your kids about your lovers that the kids aren't picking up the general mood of the household! he went on to say that his kids have no idea (right) and that it was going to stay that way. like i was trying to get him to tell his kids, shit! he just didn't want to hear any mention of the possibility that some of this situation's failure had something to do with him. he blamed me for the whole thing. told me his was hoping that having me here would help the kids while he and his wife could be free to "live their separate lives." that he and his wife had decided to "stay together for the kids," and that my being here was supposed to remedy some of the strain. ha!! no kidding, you thought that. thanks a bundle for letting me in on this agenda of yours before i came all the way out here to discover this on my own. by the way, the idea of staying together for the kids in my world doesn't mean cohabitating (part of the week) and fucking other people on the side. it means STAYING TOGETHER. and what kind of a favour are you doing for your kids by letting your house become a void of secrecy and thwarted responsibility as a parent? so then he asks me, still blaming me for everything, never /once/ admitting a lick of responsibility, if i think i can try harder and do a better job. still, this is a result of my failure. so i tell him no, that as the situation is, and without the communication i need from all parties, that no, i didn't think it was going to improve. that i'm done trying. that i tried my best as much as he would like to think otherwise. that this experience is /not/ a vacation for me. i'm not comfortable in their house, i'm not using my being here as an escape from my life back home, and that my entire life in italy is within these walls. i'm here to do my job, and it's not working out. thank god i had the trump card to lay down. after all that blaming, i was able to cap the conversation with, "and i've already changed my flight ticket to have me leave on the 12th." it felt good to have one moment of power, my power of decision to cut out. i saved that bit of info until the end, knowing that i can always change the ticket again if i saw there was room to improve things. and i wanted to hear what he had to say. i told him it would have been so much easier if he had just communicated with me all along instead of waiting until things were this big mess of bottled up tension. that i could have taken some cues and worked to fit into their expectations better if only they'd spoken to me. guess that's more of a problem than what concerns me. so i'm out of here for sure. in the mean time, i want to make this next week as good of an experience as possible between me and the kids. i feel sad for ludo... but there's nothing i can do. fab lied to me about what i was here to do. he pulled a fast one on me, and i'm not going to stick around. ok... enough writing. i can't wait to be home to see you all. i'm spending a night in london on the way home, an extended layover. so i have to make reservations for a hotel today. more computer time. i wonder if fab told the kids i'm going. maybe he's going to let me be the barer of bad news. who knows. this sucks. --charlotte 1.4.2001 Yesterday was a bit of a switch. Instead of the usual brush-off, I was surprised to actually find myself having a mutually compassionate conversation with Manuela. Yep, it seems she too is disappointed that the arrangement didn’t work out as we’d all hoped. But more than that, well… what struck me as different from what I’d expected, is that she backed me up that it’s not my fault that Jacopo and I were unable to connect. She apologized for the situation with him, saying that she too can hardly get him to speak to her, to get him out of his room, etc. additionally, she backed me up about how impossible it can be to talk to her husband about things, how he’s not exactly the warmest person and that she feels bad that the conversation the night before had to be so uncomfortable. She even went on the say that she feels bad that the two of us didn’t get along better, that “part of it is just me, how things have been…” So there! She’s human after all! I wish she could have shown this side of herself, this ability to communicate without the power dynamic in place, a long time ago! well, i suppose that now that i'm leaving, there's no longer a façade to maintain. but it sure as hell makes me feel better now to be leaving with at least some semblance of an eye-to- eye understanding of where the /situation/ failed.. and not where /I/ failed. i still can't entirely get over how ego-driven fab is. for him not to take any responsibility for the way things turned out is fucking unbelieveable. what an ass. and to think that by not admitting any fault that it wouldn't still rest on him. ridiculous. so i asked manu if she'd be needing me for the next couple of nights. one, because she was finally home from a week long vacation with her boyfriend and obviously was not going anywhere yesterday. and two, anna invited me to go for a coffee at some point today or tonight, and i wanted to be able to make plans. she said i'm free to go, then inquired whether i'd be here for dinner. to which i said no, that after the conversation i had with her husband the night before, it was going to take me a couple of days to want to spend any time around him. i'm sure she understands /that/. i feel so incredibly good about leaving. this entire city is more fun now that i feel in control again. i'm having more fun with the kids too. i bought ludo and jaco each a book this morning at a local bookshop. some silly thing for ludo and a copy of "lo hobbit" for jaco. he didn't come with us, so i thoguht i'd surprise him. hey, if he's going to isolate, he might as well find a healthy way to do it, make it work for him. i watched "LA Story" this morning and cracked up all over again. that movie is so LA. nice to slip back into the culture i love. anna should have fun with my film collection that i've been able to put together over here. hell, she's making out! i figured i'd be here for so much longer... and once i knew i was going, it was too late to cancel any of the orders. i guess it could be worse. i could have no one worthy of the generosity to leave them with. like the family! seriously, as i've told her, she helped me so so much during my stay here. the least i can do is to leave her with some things. and an open invitation to come out to san diego sometime and have an insider's tour from me. i'm going to miss her. can't wait to see her today/tonight. will probably be the last time i see her though. that always sucks. hm. it's about time to make lunch for the kids, so i'd better get off the puter. thank you all for your emails. it means so much to me to have your support. and let's party when i get home!! sunday night next week!! love to you all, charlotte 1.7.2002 As usual, the connection isn’t working, so i’m writing this in word expecting to cut and paste it later when it all works again. Sorry I haven’t emailed in a few days. I came down here on saturday to do some writing and start a load of laundry only to find the door locked. Yes, I have the keys. But it was locked from the inside so that I couldn’t get in. all day too, not just the morning as if someone wanted to sleep in, have their afternoon privacy, etc. so that pissed me off, especially because it was my mom’s birthday and I couldn’t email her. And too, they know I need to use their house. I mean, what do they think I do all day anyhow? Without the kids to look after, I have nothing really going on. Except then I found something to do. On saturday night, I finally made my way into town for a drink and some writing time. It was fun, had a few beers, met some guys. Well, we ended up seeing each other in town again at a different bar (the only one that’s open on sundays) the next day. After a drink, the one who I hit it off with the night before asked me to come out with them to another place for pizza and drinks. I was hesitant to hang out with them, seeing as though it’s not always the wisest thing to jump into a car with strangers, men, to go off into the mountains. But I accepted. What else did I have to do? But I was pretty nervous, asking all the right questions of who was going to be driving home (i.e. designated driver) and where exactly we were going. A mild anxiety attack wondering if I was making a mistake, but hell. I needed to have fun. I wasn’t too happy yesterday before I went out in the first place. We hit the road, driving up a narrow passageway through sheer cliffs dusted with snow. It was breathtaking. I wish I had pictures of it. About 30 minutes of winding around in second gear, the light faded and night fell. By the time we got there, I realized that we were on top of the mountains that we can see here from bolzano in the distance. At a ski resort called obereggan. I think I’m spelling that right. We got out, it was freezing. Seven of us, me the only girl, fought our way through the crowded tavern to a booth in the back. Beers, pizzas, pannini… the guys were super nice, struggling through their English to keep me in the conversation. we used french and spanish when we got stuck on a word or expression that we coudln't convey. for a while, we all just decided to stumble along in french because it was easier. and because i felt better having to struggle through my foreign language vocabulary for a while and let them know that i was trying too. not just leaving it up to them to meet me on my terms of communication. A band played covers of mostly American music. Stomach turning renditions of bon jovi, you guys. But it was cool. Many toasts, plenty of laughter, good pizza, decent local hooch. settling the bill was hysterical. no, they wouldn't let me pay for a thing. but watching them haggle was a riot. they weren't arguing with each other, they were just harrassing the server, trying to make it as hard for him as possible, mixing lire and euro, tossing in a few more coins as the scene continued just to keep him working on his calculator. when they finished, they gave the dude a round of applause that had the whole place looking at us. so funny. after that, we hit a bar a few feet away that was a big tipi. a circular joint packed beyond max capacity. we had another beer, i fought to speak with a woman who i'd met outside. her english is pretty good, but it didn't help having to yell over the music. i gave her my email address, and we agreed that we'd hook up this week. her name is maggie. speaks german first, then italian. but both perfectly. damn, these people are amazing. why don't americans speak multiple languages like this? i'm so envious! so, we left. a safe drive home, thankfully. pipo, my little man-pal, drove nice and carefully. we hadn't that much to drink anyway. just beer and not too much of it. we ended up back at the place we all met at last night, bar del corso i think, where one of the guys works. the place was closed, so we kept the lights off and crept in. we had a couple more beers (now that driving wasn't an issue) and ate penne (out of a bucket basically - from the kitchen, free, no need for plates). there was a football game on, inter vs. someone.... we weren't really watching. it was a great time. i decided to leave, get the walk home in before it was too late, but not before getting a little lovin' from pipo. i may or may not come find them tonight. i think i have to be here... to pick up ludo from school at 4:30, but then mondays i'm supposed to have the night off. we'll see... i haven't seen or heard from the family since friday. i did get to see anna yesterday morning. we went for a coffee... a popular thing to do on a sunday. we stopped into three places before settling on a fourth that had a table opening up. it was packed and loud, but we got a good hour's worth of conversation in there. i'm sad to have to say goodbye to her. i've been able to tell her at least about my grievances with the situation, which i know will filter back to fabrizio once i'm gone and their relationship resumes. it's nice to be able to vent to someone who genuinely cares to hear it. and it's an added bonus to know that fab's going to hear about it eventually. she tells me plenty about him. about how even if i just bowed down and claimed all the responsibility for this situation not working out, he still would behave the way he is with me. he's so full of pride, so unaccustomed to failure, so spiritually vacant (so says anna)... he's finding that all that he's worked for his entire life, the perfect education, the perfect job, the perfect family... all either mean nothing in terms of what's going to make him happy or are just plain unraveling. and when it started to go south for him, he decided to grab a girlfriend to fill the void, a move anna tried to sway him from. she tells me that when he approached her with the news about he and catherine starting a relationship, she told him she thought he was making a mistake. that he should be looking inside himself to fix what's hurting him, not to look for external solutions. seems an obvious assessment, right? canned advice? well, anna says that he just looked at her like she was speaking chinese. duh. what is that? like, take-care-of-yourself 101? she also let me know something that has me tickled. that the trump card that i played with him at the end of our blow-out conversation must have infuriated him. that i'd already made my decision and booked my flight, ending a conversation he thought he was dominating with a K.O punch... anna says it must have wrecked him. (big smile on my face) GOOD! shit, i haven't even seen him since that. anna assures me that he's ingesting plenty of it. my assessment is this: things are going to get a lot worse around here after i'm gone. i think my being here, compounded with the much bigger stuff that's already failed, is going to shake things up. it may not be immediate. but i think this disaster is just beginning. no one has even started to work on this stuff! they're all still in the cover-the-cracks- with-duct-tape mode. yikes! i'm so sure my decision to leave is a good one. before the heavy shelling begins. well, anna's feeling sorry for me, realising i'm feeling pretty down in the dumps about everything. even cried, for just a second, with her on the walk home from coffee yesterday. with my hands in my coat pockets, i leaned my head against her shoulder while she held me for a minute. maybe the most powerful minute of my time here. she asked if we could hang out again before i go, and when i looked at her in silence with a face like "you must be crazy", she thoguht that meant no. ah! quick!! i stuttered to correct her, that i was thinking of some way of phrasing my eternal, undying gratitude, not turning her down. jesus! she's only the best thing i've found in this whole continent. so we'll see each other again. and when i realised that i wouldn't have to say goodbye to her for good on that empty sidewalk yesterday, i also realised that my tears from a second before were because i was missing her already. -sigh- five days to go. -c 1.9.2002 this connection finally came up. first, here's what i wrote yesterday but couldn't mail: ________________ It seems so often lately that i can’t immediately connect to the DSL line. I’m not liking that. Then again, it’s not like I have too much longer to deal with it. Four more days! And even better, this one is almost over, and I have all my nights free this week. Yahoo! I got a text message on my phone from maggy today. She asked me to go out with her on wednesday night at 21.30. I don’t know what we’ll end up doing, but she’s nice enough and very eager to have someone to speak with in English. Two important features in a pal for a night. Tonight I’m free as well. I decided to take a night off from the boys last night, but I may go out and find them tonight. Nothing much else to do. Fending for myself for dinner is never very exciting with the cooking capacity of my little cucina. Ii would be fun to go out to eat, but that takes /real/ guts to count on my Italian to get me through ordering and paying the tab. And alone… that ain’t fun. Maybe the guys will feel up to something. Or maybe I’ll just hang out at the pub down the street and watch sports. Last night, the raiders vs. jets game was on. I was so the only one in the place watching it. Drinking a corona. So southern Californian. I finished packing for the most part today. More accurately, I made my final decisions as to what’s going to have to stay here clothes-wise. There just isn’t enough room for everything. I packed heavily coming out here, and with ski pants and new shoes and sweaters, it doesn’t leave much room in my suitcases for things I’ll never wear again. Maybe I should look into the shipping costs to send things home that way. I feel silly about this trip ending… I mean, I feel a lot of things about this trip ending. But this strikes me as weird. I’ve taken maybe ten to fifteen pictures since I got here. That’s it. And none of anyone in the family but ludo. And only one of anna. Ah! I’ve got to make a last minutes effort here to change that. And too, I haven’t been able to find /anything/ that’d be suitable to bring home as souvenirs for folks. I mean, there’s nothing truly Italian here that you can’t find at home. Sorry to all of you who had your hearts set on that coliseum snow globe. I’ll have to try harder with that one. I can’t come back empty handed. But what!!?? Maybe anna can help me to think of something. Jesus and mary figurines? Nah… mexico is already so close for that kind of shopping. I’ve got a couple of sweet treats. But that’s not as much fun as it could be. Damn this connection! It just blue screened on me because it can’t connect. More is wrong with it than just a busy line, I’m afraid. Wah! I want on!! Well, if it crashes on me again, the computer blue screening or the lights go out in the little dsl line box again, I’ll just have to try sending this again tomorrow. Jaco just finished his german lesson. Now it’s ludo’s turn. Jaco’s leaving for tennis. And as soon as one of the parents returns, I’m out of here. It’s weird having the time off. I know it’s more because Fabrizio doesn’t want to see me than because they really didn’t have plans at all this week. Last night when he got home- Well, I was told ahead of time by manu that when he go home, I was to leave. So he got home last night, walked passed the door without looking in and said hi, then went into his room and shut the door. So I grabbed my keys and left. Dunno if either one of us was being particularly rude. But if what anna says is true about how Fabrizio is, he’s definitely not going to be in the mood to see me at all before I leave. Nor do I feel all that much excitement about experiencing more brusque treatment. Do I try to speak to him again? Can we leave it at that? Can I handle it being left any worse than it is now? Do I lay it on the line that I think it’s wrong for him to try to blame me for the situation not turning out. ‘Cause shit, even if I was just doing a bad job, it’s not very mature of him to treat me this way. Or do I just walk away, let him throw his silent tantrum for my failing him, eat it because there’s no way for me to make him come around? These questions and many more… Ok. I give up on this today. It’s still not connecting and I want out of here. 1.9.02 still this thing won’t connect! I don’t know if I’ll be able to even use a computer before I get on the plane to come home. Something just isn’t right about this system. If it wasn’t Italian windows, I’d try to fix it myself. What began as a quiet night at new pub down the street ended up to be a late session of beer drinking and laughs at bar del corso. Pippo showed up eventually, but I had a lot more fun with the others who were there. New pals. One woman spoke decent English, enough to understand me and translate. It’s so nice how people actually care to be that go between, that they enjoy it, being able to talk to me. So tonight I have plans with maggy. And tomorrow? I think I should give anna a call to set something up with her. Suddenly, my social calendar is filling up. And well, she takes precedence. I’d be sad if I didn’t see her before I go. she would be too. _________ok, im on________________ On my way out last night, it was really dark as I headed out to the outer gate through the courtyard. nadia, the russian cleaning woman, happened to be walking out at the same time. we can't communicate really, but we're friendly. I saw someone walking towards me, but I couldn’t tell if it was Fabrizio or not. He usually doesn’t come in that way. So I just kept looking, trying to make out who it is. Then he mutters a hello as he passes me, and I feel like a chump and respond. I turned around to nadia after he passed us and we laughed, me pointing my eyes and remembering the word for dark. so at least he doesn't think that i was blowing him off. if i'm going to blow him off, i want him to be quite sure that it's intentional. ah... there's not much else to report from this end. i'm dreaming of home, a little worried about the readjustment process but eager to start it. i keep dreaming that i'm already home, something that i've done since i got here. always, i think in my dream that i have to go back. nope! really, i wouldn't mind doing italy again but next time as a tourist. the people here are cool, the scenary is great. but it's going to take me a while to let these bad feelings settle before i'd think of returning. i think i'll call anna now after all. to make plans earlier rather than later to make sure we do get a chance to say our goodbyes. i wish i could have met her on different terms. she's a super cool chick. i wish our connection had less to do with a crisis, me complaining. oh, and let me clear up for you that i was not locked out of the house on saturday. there's two deadbolts, and on the one, if you don't turn the key all the way (it goes around about four times before it's completely finished unlocking), there's a hook that catches that's like another lock. ha! so i bow down. they're not as mean as i thought. ok... time to get some stuff done. maybe a movie. -charlotte 1.10.2002 hi again, y'all. well, it's thursday now. only a couple of days to go! yahoo! i'm so ready to leave. what will happen to my newly rediscovered love for email? i might go through communicative withdrawls. do i ever have an interesting tidbit to relay! at least i think it's interesting. yesterday, ludo had balletto at five. so i went with her. i'm not exactly sure why that's necessary seeing as though we're dropped off and picked up by manuela. and it's not as if i'm to stay in the studio while the lesson takes place. ludo's concentration just isn't the same when she knows i'm watching her. but i'm glad i went. here's the scoop. the ballet teacher, barbara, is an adorable young women, a few years older than me. and as i mentioned before, her english is pretty good. so we spoke before the lesson got underway. i announced my departure on saturday, and /immediately/ she asked if it was because i don't get along with manuela. ha! i laughed, confirmed her suspicion, and then asked her "so what do /you/ think?" no, i'm not the only one who has a hard time with manu. she wanted to sit down with me to talk, so we did, me slumped against the wall while she contorted herself into a pretzel. i felt so ungraceful in her presence. she begins to tell me how she knows a bit about the situation at home for ludo. i didn't offer her anything new specifically. she already knew enough to where it wasn't necessary to discuss it all the same. she's angry with the parents. she knows they have lives on the side, that manuela goes off every weekend and so does her husband. and she's upset about it. she tells me that she sees the change in ludo's behaviour. how emotionally unbalanced she's become, one day wild and crazy and the next day withdrawn and passive. she's saddened to see her struggling. and she's not as compassionate towards the folks as i am. not at all. she says, "you know, some people shouldn't have children. manuela is one of them." whoa! "if you don't have time for your children, you're a bad parent." whoa! she went on to say how every week, ludo is with someone else who's looking after her. she gets passed around to babysitter after babysitter, to friend's parents, to anyone who can pick up the slack for manuela and fabrizio's unavailability. how sad is this? and how glad am i to have someone offer up this perspective without me having to divulge anything classified! i told her about jacopo's silence, and she looked pained. and that fabrizio thinks it's my fault for not being able to reach him. i told her about how i was lead to believe that i was coming here to be a part of the family. and before i could finish my thought, she interjected, "that's not a family." so! in case anyone out there thinks i'm just being too dramatic, too sensitive to the situation.... i've got alternate sources. this is way fucked. when i left after ludo's lesson concluded, i put my hand on her shoulder to let her know i was going. she stood up, hugged me!, then gave me the usual kisses on the cheeks. i've only seen her twice, mind you. "i don't blame you for leaving." is what she said as i turned to go. what a scene, huh? and by the way, manuela didn't even know when the lesson ends. she called me at six, asking where the hell we were. try six thirty, manu. it's always been til six thirty. i couldn't help but let out a playful, "i can't believe you didn't know that." ridiculous. when we got home, it was time to get ready to go out to meet maggy, the woman i met on the mountain top. i was glad to get out, spend some time with the locals. she drove all the way down here from godknowswhere, about 30 minutes away to the north. she was so excited to see me. i felt like a celebrity. she brought her friend along, the same guy she was with the night i met her (just a friend, she assures me). he's a sculptor. sat there and drew a couple of pictures of us talking on napkins. i saved one and took a picture of each of them. we spoke of work, movies, traveling, skiing, and yes... the family. she and her friend (i forget his name, unfortunately) couldn't believe i stayed here this long considering all that's going on. i gave them the short version of it all, trying to be aware of the fact that not everyone is as interested or involved in the situation as i am. but no, they kept asking me more and more questions. everyone seems to agree that it's little ludo who's getting the worst of all this, myself included. we had a good time, only staying for about an hour or so. maggy kept saying how much she wished we had met each other earlier on in my stay. which i agree, but she was a little more taken with me that i with her. which is fine... it just felt a little imbalanced. after she left, she sent me a text message on my phone (i love that feature!!) that read, "you are a positive person, you are beautiful inside. thanks for tonight!" how sweet is that? so thusday. i have the whole day to myself. ludo is staying at a friend's house tonight and going there straight after school, so i don't have to pick her up. i don't have to do anything until tomorrow when i get her from school. it kind of seems strange to me that she'd leave when i leave so soon. but whatever. i can find a way to entertain myself. i meet up with the guys tongiht at six. i got a picture of luca last night wearing a sombrero and drinking a margarita (which i showed the bartender how to make). i hope it turns out. he's adorable. and tomorrow i have plans to see anna at 11.30 in the morning for a coffee and to say our goodbyes. i wish we could do it today instead. i just know i'll be emotional after i walk away... and then i have to go pick up ludo! i hate that. i'd rather let it out, stew, regain my composure, then be seen in public again. but i'm at the mercy of anna's schedule. and really, i'm just grateful that i get to see her one last time. hopefully i'll get a few more pictures of her too. and maybe even one of me while i'm at it. i haven't had anyone take one of me since i've been here. and then saturday i'm off. it turns out (gulp) that fabrizio is taking me to the airport. argh! no no no... maybe this is perfect. it's he who i have the lingering feelings about. he invited me here. we need to talk a little one last time before i go. i don't have an agenda in mind. i think it would be best not to generate expectations, just to listen and respond as i see fit as the conversation happens. and you know, i was thinking this morning. if i really hated him... ok. not "hate"... but if i really wanted to be mean to him, i wouldn't give him any information, any insight, any suggestions to help. i would just let him bask in his dimness, let him believe that he's in the right 100% and that every thing is all my fault. he has a chance to learn a lot from what went down with me. ...ok, so i'm only saying that to take the pressure off myself to talk about things. to let me feel powerful in not communicating to the point i truly think is necessary. alright. time to hit the store for food, maybe into town for some silly trinkets or postcards. i have to have something to show for my trip in material form. besides all this writing. _50 days in hell_ by charlotte conrad, available from simon and shuster, hardcover, $29.99. 'til tomorrow. then that's it. i'll see you all at home. -charlotte 1.11.2002 Ok, so you know how when you use Microsoft word, under the file menu it lists the last four files that have been accessed. Well, guess whose are the first two… good thing I know better than to leave anything in them. I selected all of both documents and deleted them before closing the program, so they were saved as blanks. Ha! Whoever tried to access them must have been disappointed. So again, the dsl line won’t connect immediately. So I write in word, expecting to cut and paste later… if it comes on while I’m here. Anna should call me around 11.30 to meet me for a coffee. I can’t wait to see her, although true too, I’m not looking forward to having to say our goodbyes. I’ve got manuela’s Dido CD playing as usual. The last song is so fantastic… I might have to buy it for the plane trip home. Speaking of spending money, I wonder if I get paid for the last 11 days of working here. Or do I have to wait until the following month (haha). Don’t worry, I’ll ask about it on the trip to the airport. Pray for me that it’s not a dramatic exit, my car ride with Fabrizio. I wish it was Manuela. Somehow she’s become a less threatening figure to me. It’s wild how that switched. Last night, after finishing writing in the remaining pages of my journal, I decided to sit back and read what I’ve written in there about my experiences here. What a trip. The writing in there is different from what I write in my emails. More emotionally based, more how I’m feeling and less about what’s actually going on. It was fun slipping back into the feelings, although the feelings weren’t exactly fun ones. I’m glad I’ve been writing about all of this. Keeps it from becoming just one big exhausting blur of events. It’ll help me to remember. Some of my friends that I’ve met here invited me to go out to a discotec tonight. Which would be a hoot. But I think the family just might want me to hang out with them. At least, I would assume so. Ludo does, I know that much. Poor kid. She’s going to have a hell of a time having to adjust to my being gone, having to find someone else to bond with. I want to stay here tonight just for her. Maybe after she goes to bed, I’ll go out. But tomorrow I have to wake up early to leave for the airport. For some reason, I’m getting dropped off there at like 9am when my flight isn’t until 4:30 in the afternoon. Kind of tacky of them to offer to take me and then make me have to sit there for that long doing god knows what. But hey, just that much quicker that I get the hell out of here. Time at an airport is hardly worse than a long afternoon here at the house. How do I leave things with the family. To Jacopo, a casual, “see ya,” will suffice. Ludo will involve some tears and a lot of gentle reassurances. The usual cheek kissing to say hello and goodbye just doesn’t feel like a comfortable gesture between me and manu. We’re on handshake level of intimacy. Would it be super rude to dodge her? Or fab? to self: don't be an asshole, charlotte. just get out of here safely. ok... that was anna, so i'm outta here. my hands are shaking. why?! maybe more later... -c

 Wow. That was total crap tonight. There isnt enough alcohol in the world to fix it either. Cause all I want to do is hit the sheets and forget the evening altogether. I wish I wanted to drink it off of me. Guess Id rather let the disappointment gestate. If anyone wants to know /this/ is why Im a hermit. This is why I hate going out, seeing people, putting my expectations on the line. I let expectations build to a whopping expectancy of people showing up somewhere only to be reminded of the sting of disappointment. Waiting around in two places, one being a bar, feeling like Id been infected with herpes and couldnt be touched with the courtesy of kept plans. I think I had the venue for dinner wrong. Fucking chain restaurant that I didnt look into (Carlsbad? Oside? Who knows?). I rode my assumption into the ground. Then hit the bar we were supposed to convene at an hour and a half of utter depression, playing it off with two drinks to distract and reading a horribly written lesbian zine that almost offended me more than the flakage of the fellow queers that I thought I was meeting. Can I please come on as your editor!?? So I called Scott and helped him bounce at Martini Ranch. The one in Encinitas in case anyones keeping score!! In case it fucking matters. God, this is all so humbling. I guess I was looking forward to the camaraderie. Guess I do need the collective spirit to keep me afloat. Yet tonight I unsubscribed to the groups listserv in the heat of hurt feelings. Wrote one email saying Ill see you next fall. I dont do well with things like this. Short of crying (actually wore eye make-up tonight, so I would have ended my night by doing so), I let out a series of shrill screams in my car horrid enough to weaken my voice. Should be satisfactorily horse tomorrow. Tonight? I hate people. I hate getting my hopes up. I hate feeling like I need social interaction altogether. Tomorrow Ill wake up and kill myself at the gym. And I wont answer emails from anyone in the group who has my real address. My feelings are hurt, and Im not mature enough to want to back it up with a reasonable handling of what is so obviously a mistake in communication. Im working on too thin of a buffer to do that. Too sensitive. Too much wanting to disappear anyway. I came home tonight before seeing Scott to check my mail and lied to my parents about what happened. How much more emotional it would have been to tell my mom Im hurting for not getting to be a part of a group I need in my life so as not to kill myself. It doesnt have to be at school. But I need this community. Im fucking lost without a sense that Im not the only queer woman in the world. I do too much on my own as it is. Too shut off from loving. Too shut off from getting to express myself. This sucked. And whats worse its no ones fault. Theres no one to blame. Just a disappointment I didnt want to have to endure. I know Im being unreasonable. I know that part of me is too quick to assume this submissive position of nothing is worth the effort, especially relating to people. Its ridiculous to do this, walk away from what has tickled my sense of purpose, all this communal action on campus, this time spent with people who cry everyday for the same reasons I do. But you know? I cant. Looking past the immediate disappointment is the fact that Ive been so deeply affected is this even that big of a deal? Yet I wonder At this vulnerable stage, am I willing to let outside influences make me sad? Can I handle any more than the sheer being that weighs on me? Its a delicate balance these days. Lots of suspension lots of acting-as-if, to use the parlance of the 12-step community. Im paring this down to basics. This hurts, and I dont like it. I dont know how much room I have for excusing things. Even if theres a plain explanation for why it happened. Im just not strong enough right now to laugh at it and move on. And then I go see Scott and all the straight girls dressed to the nines tonight at the bar and feel even more out-of-place. This is not the option Im looking for. Felt more estranged than before I went out. Their point in dressing that way is obvious. To attract. But why? If they spent that much time cultivating their autonomy god, where would this world be if individuals were looking out for themselves instead of looking out to snare another person? And why do I secretly need that? Are all humans pack animals? Im sad and tired and Im not going to cry. Tomorrow Ill forget most of this and work out until its overcome. And Ill do something nice for a stranger and feel good again.

 Please kill me now - I cannot bear the stench of my own rotting flesh, the eternally piping-hot fries jammed deep into my nostrils and stuck in my scalp, nor the stinging insects that live beneath my bacon necktie. --James Lileks



 Wow! What a response! I havent had that many hits on these sites in weeks! Well, I suppose thats rather encouraging to know that you all still have interest in keeping up on all the bitching and rambling. Theres certainly more to come. If Ive plugged in my new (Christmas) XBOX, youd better believe that its because I have time on my hands. Yay! Blinx!! Id forgotten how much I like staring at a screen unblinking until my eyes water and I realise I havent eaten in hours. Hooray! Seems the gang realises Ive nothing to do, so this afternoon I received a phone call from Luis asking me to take him to work. Broken car for weeks has sent him scrambling to get rides everywhere. So I did it a quick jaunt of 70 miles round trip. In weekend traffic enough to make me want to pull out a 357 and thin the crowd (only then thered be a lot of cars unable to get the fuck out of my way on account of the bullet wounds). Maybe a little Simpsons Road Rage on the XBOX will make it all better. What an enormous waste of time. Yet so gratifying Hazy marine layer squelching my plans to lay in the sun. Now what? The house is immaculate, my back feels like I was laying bricks all morning, and Im as broke as can be on account of those bastards at the insurance company who cant get their shit together enough to keep me on the dole (or cut me loose already so I can get a job and make a lot more than their pitiful payments to me). Scurrying around to fill the time with useful activities, staving off the inevitable doom of having too much time to think about things, too much spare energy to worry myself into a corner. This is why Im taking so much summer school. What else am I going to do? How else am I going to get by? Laundrys done, bathrooms sparkling, closet organised, bed washed and made vacuumed, did the dishes even wiped down the baseboards. Crazy the way I get when the clean-button gets pressed. Its hard to turn it off once I get going. I found a Barbie doll that excited me for a second, envisioning what found art I could make out of it if only I could pop its sweet little head off and make some adjustments. But alas, all the welding tools are at the ranch in Julian. Ill have to save that craft project for another day. Found a bunch of old pictures reorganising the book stacks. Images of me 30 pounds heavier with a cigarette in one hand lying on my back in the middle of a concrete walkway where I fell down and couldnt go any further. Beer beside me, brought to me by a humane Bryan who took the picture. All this pre-surgery when things like this happened so much me falling down and lying wherever until my back relaxed. Pre-surgery times when I did nothing but drink Sierra Navadas by the case and swallow pain pills awaiting relief. Goddamn, a lot has happened this year. I suppose I could begin to get ready for the night out. A bunch of us in the LGBTetc group from school going out for a bite and some drinks at a local north county gay bar. Wishing my parents wouldnt come home tonight putting me in the position of having to again lie to them about where Im going. Wondering what clothes to wear meaning, what identity to adopt. I always feel flimsy and out-of-place wearing girl clothes and lets just say that the militant lesbian boots arent seeming to fit me anymore either. Like it should matter. Im not trying to sleep with anyone there, am I? Well then! That settles that! Youre wearing a bra! I should be wasting my time writing stories instead of this indulgence. All my thinly disguised creations of wish-fulfillment where I seduce my teachers and tie up friends. I should contact Susie Bright about her next edition of the Best Lesbian Erotica, 2004 and get cracking. Or the ones where I pretend Im Raymond Carver and try to drop my signature self aggrandising language and just tell the story in an actual human vernacular. So pretentious! I guess thats what you get when you learn to write on crystal methamphetamine. Every thought seems brilliant, no matter how inflated and unreal. And of course when I say Raymond Carver I mean they all have to do with raw disappointment, alcoholism and failed relationships. You know, the staples of life along with sex and death. Its 4pm, and I havent eaten a damn thing. Maybe a nap to cap the mania and slow it down enough to actually be around people tonight and have a good time. Before I burn out at 8 oclock.

 Thought I'd post a picture of one of the boys having lush-ous fun with me, here's the classic me and Luis picture... Apparently, it's not a picture unless you open your mouth and scream.

 Its a Saturday morning, damp out, still early, the day filled with expectation as if Im about to suit up for an early soccer match. I dreamt last night that I was playing, fluid play, the kind of soccer thats so clean and well executed you could fall back in the grass and laugh at how good you are. I dreamt of my teammates, the girls, the camaraderie of the fight to win and be better. I conjured up all the anticipation of those matches, the zone I slip into, the same place I go to in my head when Im writing well. What I wouldnt do to be sitting before a trainer getting my ankles taped, staring blankly at the grass breathing slowly and deliberately to steady my focus. Firing away shots and the keeper to warm her up and intimidate the opposition. Disappointment that my body is broken and Ive lost all of that for good has me in tears this morning. I still cant believe that part of me is gone. Think Ill pose as a meth addict and clean the house today. Part of me is afraid to get into it, waiting for the inevitable moment when I start to lose myself and I cant stop because its never clean enough. I dont know whether I was like this before I started using drugs or what. Cleaning, like writing, can have an effect of frantic addiction. I cant stop. I slip into this tight focus, like a racehorse being whipped along. Like the nights when I start drinking next to my laptop and I seem to be in a race with myself to put them down as systematically as the sentences that come out. God, its a challenge to live within the bounds of being an addict. Id better take a pain pill now so that when Im up to my elbows in bathroom cleaners and the tailbone is throbbing, Ill at least not care that it hurts. When Im on my knees ordering my shoes according to colour and style and frequency of wear (its a complicated equation), Ill know that Ill be able to walk in them by the end of the day. Focus. Its a tricky one to master. Always bordering on excess. Wheres the line between doing it and doing too much?

 My own creepy version of a streetwalker living a couple of doors down. Icky looking woman with stringy hair and weak chin, pathetic enough to make you want to just hit her repeatedly and get it over with. Every morning she walks the neighbourhood, hunched forward, her saggy but in flattering sweatpants and this wasted looking grey and teal ball cap that no one ever told her how to wear properly. It wouldnt bother me so much if she had a little social conditioning to where she realised how fucking tacky it is to look in peoples windows as you pass by. Like, Im not a fan of wearing clothes to bed, so when I leave the sheets behind to check my email in the AM, I dont bother to hide the goods. Call it a rush. Brisk air, messy hair I look dyno-mite. Maybe she gets a kick out of it. Maybe if you look like that you wonder what could have been if you were born with better genes and took care of yourself. You want a visual of this woman? Try the landlady in Kingpin, add a few pounds and a few years. One day Ill go on my mercy killing spree and make her house my first stop. Since its close by and all.

 Disgusting tint from red wine coating my teeth looks like Ive been snacking on raw meat or my teeth are dead. How many times a day to I brush/floss my teeth? Is it ever enough? Like a fucking OCD champ scrubbing the skin off of my hands in the sink, glazed eyes chanting, now Im not dirty, now Im not dirty! a mouth is a terrible thing to neglect. Maybe Ill quit the coffee and smokes. Itd do more than a little Trident after meals. 2 out of 3 dentists agree. Fuckin A my favourite Curb your Enthusiasm episode was on tonight for us to watch while we ate the homemade pizza I assembled. A salty smackdown of kalamatas, feta, and pepperoni, complete with corn meal on the pizza stone for added flair. Let B eat the last piece despite the fact that Ive hardly eaten all day. For days. School stress diet. System shutting down, breath held. Liquid diet of liquor and Gatorade, depending on the hour. It was the Shaq episode. The quintessential Larry David, so tightly wound, so perfectly drawn. I couldnt watch that show when I first gave it my attention. The frustration of watching him grate against his friends and family were enough to send small objects flying through the air by my hand in the direction of the TV. You have to appreciate the pain the show causes you. Appreciate the attitude. Its sheer brilliance, that show. People are so stupid! So ridiculous! If you cant see yourself in this show, if you cant identify, well then youre fooling yourself. No one wants anything to do with him after he trips Shaq at the game, and its the best thing that could ever happen to him. Ha! Fuck you too!! Man Cheers to that. What a nightmare it must be to be married to that guy. I could go on and on discussing exactly why that episode rules, but Im too lazy tonight. And I keep derailing myself with visions of other episodes like The Thong that second guess my assertion that this one is the best. Since taking that nap was so incredibly lovely, Im going to sneak back in and linger some more. Call it a night early and give tomorrow the fresh, undrunken start today was missing. Seems I have to scratch all possibility of doing anything if I wake up drunk. Ok, so that may seem obvious to everyone else. Ill switch back to pain pills tomorrow and regain my composure, my focus. Hahaha this is supposed to be funny, my little schtick. Ill get a handle on this, I swear it.

 While not technically an alcoholic manoeuvre under the article 13 which states one has to be sauced for it to count, I just tripped my little self walking up the stairs with my glass of wine in my hand, spilling just enough to curse out loud. See? Its a good thing Im alone! Muthufucking militany lesbian boots too butch for me. I was thinking about a lesbian beauty night, complete with drag dress-up and gender identity swapping. Guess that settles that. Ill repaint my nails instead. What a shame to queers everywhere! Id better go out tonight and redeem myself. Or wait til tomorrow night when the gang hits Greystokes and there are actual lesbians around. Fucking marginalised sexuality. Makes causing trouble so much harder! Bryans coming by with wine and an appropriately aged idea for the nights activities. Nothing. No going out, no scattered plans to meet up with five different people at five different bars between 9pm and two. Nothing ambitious. Unless you call watching Sex in the City reruns with a 37 year old man ambitious. What a pair, me and him. His brother Chris, dubbed low-stamina boy by all, can be thrown right in the mix without too many waves in our pool of inert stasis. But tonight it looks like Chris ex-girlfriend Ali is in town, so hes occupado. Ali, the girl he had a child with and gave up for adoption. Ali, the first fuck of mine post-surgery. Me, still trying to be dominant as we frolicked naked in the wet sand in Solana Beach after hours. She lost her shoes. I lost my fears that I wouldnt be able to have any fun with the no-harness law instated by physicians in post-surgery cases such as mine. And I thought having my tongue pierced required a relearning. Alright, alright tidying up before B comes by. Like it matters. Shit. Maybe there are some Curb Your Enthusiasm episodes about to rerun. Yep. Schools out, and its time to do absolutely /nothing/ with my time. Yay!!

 As if my day wasnt fucked enough, driving home tonight from a much needed soul-session with Jennifer, I watched as a black Doberman was run over by a car. Like right in front of me, saw it tumble, heard it scream. I braked, so did everyone else but one car. A white SUV ran right into it. The poor baby darted off into a bush, but I doubt it would have made it. I pulled over sobbing wildly, wondering if it wouldnt be better if I just got back into my car and pretended it didnt happen. To spare myself the added despair of seeing more pain and a death I cant attend to. I cant believe the shock of the accident allowed it to run off. Like I mirage in the road, I saw its silhouette and new to slow down just in case. Apparently not everyone saw it. No more tonight. I may not blog for a while either. Ive got major shit going on.

 The discretion meter is going through the roof this afternoon. Best to keep the inappropriate to myself. Meaning, I have nothing pressing to say thats going to be posted up here. I had some things I was planning to blog about all afternoon until getting word of my worse-than-I-thought financial situation turned the day into my own private nightmare. Small problem in the scope of the rest of the world, but I dont do too well with the small things sometimes. And I have a lot more than money to think about. Long weekend? Youd better believe it.

 Ambivalent marine layer keeping me from being able to get dressed. This at 10:30, glory be to god, because I got to sleep in until just now. This whole vacation sleep thing is really starting to grow on me. Another hour-long massage tonight at five oclock. The proper way to kick off a long weekend, Id say. That and some shameful sonic enjoyment this morning to get me motivated to break out of the lingering malaise of a foggy morning and do something with myself. I cant find my head yet this morning. Mind full of sleep, shitty rap music, distracting thoughts of how to go about letting my hair down this weekend. Later I need to sweat.

 Ok, ok cruddy day until I kicked myself in the ass and got out of the house to see Amy later on, and Im glad I did. I have some things to write about tomorrow, and I swear I will. Not about her, the night nothing like that. Just a resurgence of dedication to keep on my little hobby here. For now, its time for bed. As much as I could wind myself up now with the frantic outpouring of what clearly feels like my signature mania coming through at a late hour. Sleep is better for me right now. This is supposed to be casual. No editing, no read throughs, and certainly no deadlines to perform by.

 Its interesting when you see yourself so clearly in another person. Even more so when you find yourself responding with compassion towards the same things that you do yourself things that when you do them make you want to jump off a cliff. Strange how that wheel turns.

 Frustration from losing a long morning blog that I needed to post. Didnt save it in time. Searching my head for things to offset the feelings. Settling instead for inaction. Sedatives. It doesnt matter. I shouldnt be wasting my time anyway. I shouldnt be allowing myself to depend on writing to feel better. Its not real. Im going back to bed. Im going to sleep through the day and try again tomorrow.

 What a massage. At least I can rest assured that, as long as it has been, I still respond to the power of human touch. My lord, I picked my head up from its place on the table when the massage was over, and I felt like someone had injected me with heroin. The soft touch of two warm hands and her knowing intention attached to that sassy young thing named Jennifer! Sure Im smitten with her. Is it humanly possibly to abandon your all your tension to a cute woman (while lying naked covered in oil, I thank you) and not be smitten? Lord oh lord that delicate touch over my tender little scar the gentle squeak of a ceiling fan beating time oh the analogies. Its tough, people. Im not good at being restrained. It was difficult not to reach out and touch her. One of these days Im going to have to turn over and return the favour. And then some, yes? Hey! I am a licensed massage therapist. And yes, that fact does get me laid.

 FOR ANDREA:

 just a thought... is this inappropriate? i just can't tell anymore... about a lot of things. sometimes i wonder if i shouldn't be shutting my mouth and going back to writing just for myself. anyway... i had a decent night, and i'd like nothing more than to crawl into my crisp white sheets and bury my head in sleep. my favorite part of the day.

 Dude, somethings wrong with my site sometimes. The archives wont load; sometimes the page itself is lost. Guess it doesnt matter to anyone but me (much like the contents themselves oh, the irony). Plans to go out tonight. Trying desperately to peel myself off the carpet and pull myself together. A mixture of ennui and paranoia. I could go on to conclude that Im comfortable resting back into agoraphobia now that theres nothing really requiring me to leave the house, pushing me out the door with the threat of real trouble if I dont. God, I cant believe how consistently I showed up to my classes this spring. Ive already run out of fun things to read over my exciting vacation time sitting at home in tears over this and that. David Sedaris stories about learning French. Lovely. Sam the Cat - Matthew Klams decent into becoming gay, only he cant see it. Couldnt help myself the other day I leant that one to Claudia. This time something meant for enjoyment, not with a mind for a subtext to scream out at her like so many other loaned materials. Unless of course Im poking fun at her love for me when shes supposed to be straight. Gosh, maybe that wasnt too cool after all. Fuck it. After all that, I deserve a manipulative upper hand every once in a while. Even if I dont realise it at the time (I can enjoy it now!). We both hate ourselves. Its all in good fun. See you at the bottom! we cheer. So I suppose theres little else to do but get started on the reading for my four summer school classes. Stave off the sinking feeling that Im wasting my life just being still for a few days. My pride got the better of me today at the gym when someone noticed what I was reading. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Ha! No no! I swear! Its for a class on Childrens Literature. Really, I can read big-kid books too! (Gulp) I kept the pages wrapped around the book so no one saw me. Which isnt altogether easy on the elliptical when every few minutes the pain pill Ive taken causes me to swoon a little, losing my balance. When I bought them all at B&N, I made a point to explain myself to the cashier about the class. Lest anyone think Im slow. Lest anyone suspect I have any children of my own. God forbid (and I believe that) I almost took a baseball bat to my own head yesterday at the library when the smell of poopy pants and the shrill scream of a young one split open my head as I hurriedly searched for copies of Alice in Wonderland on video for a class presentation on comparing film versions. Couldnt get out of there fast enough. Nope, none for me, thanks. Dont think Im on the right road to get pregnant anywho. God be blessed for latex being around while I was a teenager. And in case anyone needs a reason to swear off men Heres a lovely visual. So sorry again if anyone's eating at their computers.

 I hope no one out there is eating. When Food and Death Collide.

 I must be getting older because of what Im about to say Why cant people take responsibility for themselves? Its really simple it sometimes involves raking in the praise for a good deed, and yet other times it involves a simple issuance of apology. Hell, I apologise for other people all the time! Its easy, and it makes stuff roll along much smoother. Just ask Matt, our fearless leader of the schools LGBT group. Now, Ive removed my email address from the listserv because of my dramatic tendency to shut down completely in the face of hurt feelings (under the cover of seething anger). This message reached me by way of another group member who forwarded it to me. in brief, Matt sought to exonerate all parties from responsibility for Saturday nights incident of multiple no-shows at the end-of-the-semester night out. No one is to blame repeated twice for emphasis. Which, as president, sounds really nice, and I know he means well to say such a thing. Would anyone like to jump in here and tell me why this doesnt sit well with me? Correct! How about letting those of us who were sitting around, stood-up like idiots, grant the reprieves? Let those people feel the effects of their failure to commit to the plans they made. It isnt comfortable to hurt peoples feelings. Nor should it be. There are no consequences if the matter is dismissed like this. I think its crap. But since Im no longer a part of the group, I suppose its not of my concern how they choose to move on from here. Thing is, part of me thinks I really do need this group to get by. But I cant stand for more disappointment. Which is, in itself, a disappointment. Its just simpler to need and willingly go without it than it is to need and have it withheld. No, its not logical, is it?

 Martha, Inc. What a steaming pile of propaganda crap. Someone tell me, whats the status of her legal situation? Is this PR to get her off or what?! At least the writing is so bad, I could be two bottles of wine into the night and still not miss a beat. Heavy-handed? Oh my, oh my... Its sick to admit, but there was a point in time when I had a little twisted crush on this woman. Whats not sexy about an uptight, puritan, middle-aged, elitist, Connecticut perfectionist? Me-ow! Dont ask for specifics. Lets just say shes a crafty chick. Id love to colour outside of the lines to see what happens. What a bitch! Im so turned on! Ive been sleeping all day. A late night drive is /so/ in order. At the risk of missing all this wonderful network TV yes. Ill somehow manage. This is like a train wreck. I can't look away.

 One hit away from triple digits this month! Yee-haw, patrons! Took advantage of the quiet afternoon to catch up on the sleep I missed out on last night. That, and to avoid the defeat of being on vacation yet having no more than ten bucks to my name with which to have a good time and get out and do all those things Id responsibly avoided while being busy with my classes. Aching hands and chest, tears never far behind, I took my chances that by sleeping the day away Id feel somewhat better when I woke up. Maybe by sleeping more I can work out more. Maybe I can turn this into an advantage and kick my ass into better shape. That or break myself in half searching for an endorphin high to overcome much more than a passing melancholy. So Im in the gym this morning. one of those days where youre so in the zone that an hour on the elliptical felt like five minutes, and if it werent for the fact that youve finished all the reading you brought and watching the telly on those little monitors would exhaust your patience more than the workout, youd be powering away until you pass out. Speaking of going champions-style, check this out people are always leaving their CDs in the machines after their workouts, creating endless fun surfing through an unmarked burned creation. But what I found this time? The fucking soundtrack to Rocky! Isnt that adorably pathetic? First of all that someone would buy the thing. Secondly, that after this many years since the movies came out and subsequent pop culture references to it have faded into obscurity heres some shameless dope that still finds the music inspiring. So swept up in imaginings of jogging through Philly punching at the air in a fabulous sweatsuit circa 1976, this guy left his precious CD in the machine. Now what? Hum Survivors Eye of the Tiger to himself? Dude, I wasnt even born yet when that movie came out. Guess it is a slightly different demographic at Frogs in Encinitas than any one I can claim as my own. And to be fair, Ive been known to listen to my share of Heart and the like. Most are horrified to see what things Ive accumulated on my hard drive. Things far too awful to pay for. So I walk into the locker room admiring the scenery once again, careful to look down so I dont trip over someones shit in the forest of discarded towels and makeup bags. Theres this woman talking about her kid (of course! What else would she be speaking about?) and about getting him tested for admission to the GATE program in his elementary school. IQ tested, something that if he did well enough would allow him special schooling, bragging rights, all that good stuff. Hell, I remember taking mine vividly. Not so much for the experience but for the result, the tricky dual-edged sword of having such a thing measured in what some believe to be a pretty reliable quantification. You dont take the test unless youre pretty sure youre not the average clown. Am I right? Even if you are pretty stupid, most people are inclined to think theyre sharper than the average Joe. But not everyone wants this kind of knowledge. For two reasons. One, its about expectation. You fuck up on the test, and no one expects you to do much more than work on your hands and knees with elbow-length kitchen gloves for the rest of your life. On the other hand, if you do wonderfully, from then on youre destined to be a disappointment, never quite filling the shoes your parents so generously gave to you. (i haven't quite decided what happens to "normal" people) The next problem with knowing is about one-upping. Get a little self-inflated, and just remember that theres always going to be someone who dwarfs you in comparison, so its best to shut your mouth and act as if you dont have the information at all. When this stupid woman gleefully relayed the information that her little Johnny scored a, get this, a 120 on the test, eyes a-twinkle with good old fashioned Mom-pride, I couldnt help but smile smugly to myself and fantasize about pissing on her parade with my superiority. Yet still, her announcement elicited the kind of praise that only a roomful of identity-dependent young mothers would give in the face of a situation where their childrens achievements seem to reflect on their own sense of self-worth. Ooohs and Ahhhs all around. I bit my tongue. 149 and I live at home. Nough said. But man, can I clean a toilet.

 Altogether now! I do believe there's someone sleeping who's not following along!

 Whens the last time you pounded your fists on someones door at 2am? Fucking dog up the street barking incessantly like they locked it out or something, barking away, waking me up, barking, barking, alarming my dog, bark, bark, out on the balcony twenty yards away, barking, now in the backyard wheres the poisoned steak robbers use in the movies? Id have thrashed that little piece of shit dog myself if only I could get my hands on it. Ill shut your fucking dog up for you. Just let me borrow your shovel. I hate these neighbours! So mutherfucking righteous driving up our steep hill at 1o mph just to make a show of following the rules, causing my car to run high when Im stuck behind him. So I routinely pass the asshole, probably causing him a heart attack of powerlessness. My dad gives me a high-five for brazen retribution. The way this dude controls his wife is a hot topic of gossip, rumours floating through the neighbourhood. Fucking yellow X-terra. Stupid stepford wife in her diesel Mercedes. Makes me want to do more than just leave a big mouthful of spit on each of their windshields as I walked back to my house. Entertaining wild fantasies of taking a baseball bat anything made of glass that they might own that was left out as carelessly as their dog. Juvenile delinquent behaviours like egg throwing or spray paint. Oh yeah, I left a nasty note, punctuated by one last thump at their front door. And FINALLY now, the dog seems to have lost its desire to keep us all up. Lets see if my anger can fade enough for me to go back to sleep as well. Theyre /so/ going to hear from me tomorrow. Im going to find out their names (yes, they live right across the street from me and have for years, and I dont know any of them by name) and Im going to find out their phone number, and Im going to call them all night long the next time this happens. Fucking outrageous irresponsibility! Yes, Im Jim Conrads daughter. One day Im going on that killing spree, and it seems I have two stops right on my own block.

 I tried making it to the gym, but it was still too early and this mysterious fluid running down my cheeks wouldnt have looked good showing it off in public. So I went for a little drive instead, allowing myself to be swept up in the cornyness of that Peter Gabriel song with Kate Bush Dont Give Up. Hadnt heard it in a while, and since Kate Bush has a talent for consistently getting down in there and shaking me every time I listen to her, well What ever happened to her? Tori Amos stole her gig, sure. Did they conference about it and decide theres only room for one of them? Did they arm wrestle for the job? Mud wrestle? A devil went down to Georgia showdown? Man, I didnt intend for this new blog page to fall into the same vortex of self-pity that the last one was. I suppose Im doing the best I can only I have different intentions once I can get my bearings and see straight. Busying myself with school was like wearing blinders, and now that theyre removed its going to take a couple of days to adjust to all the light coming in. I didnt quite nail that metaphor down, but Im satisfied with it. Hit the mark of letting myself off the hook for stumbling here, for feeling raw, stripped down. Even though it was a strong finish at school, its still a loss to have something end. Kind of like when I ran track and would vomit at the finish line. Yet a different loss here than the gastric-contents type. Maybe its about time to sit still with some tea and give the ol I Ching a toss. Then maybe go back to bed and see what happens after a little more sleep.

 i wasted a little time and doctored this image. i once saw this phrase as a bumber sticker and nearly drove off the road laughing. image courtesty of the zoloft website. and yes, i went to the site for the specific reason of finding this little guy, not because i enjoy surfing anti-depression drug websites. i ended up printing this onto a t-shirt transfer the other day. just can't decide which shirt to ruin.

 Awakened in a panic this morning over what clearly was a troubling night for me. Too early to do anything with the day its a little after five. Blue-grey light glowing past the shutters. Stomach turning with pangs of shame for allowing my feelings to be hurt last night. Bitter regret over spending my last few dollars on drinks in wait for something that never happened. When all the while I could have been safely tucked in at home, not traversing the whole county in my car burning gas that I cant afford. The gym doesnt open for another hour and a half. Id better get in there this morning before I start crying, cause its looking like its going to be a long, difficult day. Thinking of resurrecting the bathrobe chronicles for another day of moping at the keyboard, calling fundamentals into question and plotting my escape from it all. No schoolwork to sink myself into. Nothing to refocus the energy on. Having no structure is a bad thing. Im going to have to pretend I have things to do today or else surrender to the undertow. Id better get to the beach and at least take myself for a pre-dawn walk make something beautiful out of the early start instead of letting worry and disappointment get a foothold right off the bat. I can always sleep through the afternoon if things still look bad. Dont look back. Make the bed and get out of here.

 weight loss, infection, bouts of sleep likened to a coma. big day of public speaking today. must pull it together. if my professor can do it with chemo going on, i can too.

 How does my physical environment maintain such a high level of order and cleanliness when so much is drastically chaotic? So calm when another loss arrived at my doorstep today. My therapist let me go. Said she can no longer help me. she cried, I handed her a Kleenex and numbed out. Like a slash on the wrist, the pain of another abandonment at the wrong time almost felt a relief. Not fighting the feelings. Being them. Slow and mute like living underwater. Making it to school today shut off the faucet of tears. Removed. Im in so much trouble. Begin small. Phone calls. Frequent speaking to real people in real time. Eat again. Make a glass of wine go down and go to bed.

 I dreamt last night of a corpse. It was me, weeks past death, decaying and smelling of rotten flesh. I was looking around for a place to put it, for where to dispose of it because I couldnt carry it with me anymore. I kept losing parts of it. Legs and fingers and pieces of my face would fall away as I searched. So fragile it kept breaking apart. Until all I had left was a leg and my head and some bits in between, wrapped in a blanket that I kept with me. Searching. Parts of me are dying. I have to do something to stop this. Life shouldnt be this way. If lithium will help, well then by all means. Ive dropped enough hints in this forum for you all to know what Im talking about. Im going for help this week. I cannot write it away any longer. Serious shit. Boy are my folks going to be disappointed when I tell them. That being said, I may not say much here. Thanks for your understanding.

 Speed freak. Up all night restless and exhausted. Two hours of solid sleep before I got up at 4am. Watched television until the infomercials wore me down. One day I too shall give a testimonial on one of those things. True fame. Cleaned everything in site including the washer and dryer with windex, ordering the bottles of soaps on a little towel. Laundry, scrubbing sinks and floors, vacuuming the house. All by 9:30. compulsive thoughts I cant control. I dunno if this is the right medication for me to be on. Im too hopped up to stand still long enough to smoke a cigarette. Should maybe go to the gym and see if I can burn off some of the excessiveness. But the no-sleep and the tension has me worried about what that will do to my back. This cleaning binge is sure to haunt me once I slow to a hum and notice the pain. Now what?

 Hi, Charlotte, I'm sorry I brought up a sensitive subject (for both of us) last night. I don't want to hurt your feelings...I love you. Have a calm, peaceful weekend without us. Love, Mom

 Fucking parents. They succeeded in getting me to flee the house about four hours ago with their rude comments. As if nothing at all has happened here. Like blood in the water. What began as an innocuous conversation about the old-days of TV turned into a scathing indictment of the sexual nature of todays television. Pointing out immediately that my moms favourite show is Sex in the City. To no avail. The conversation (or was it a monologue by mom?) went on about how every nation who has allowed for sexual freedom has fallen on their faces. Backed up by dad and his statistical offerings, not a word from me, of course. Just a quiet, hoping-youll-drop-this-line-of-conversation tone of I dont agree. But no. it couldnt end there. I wasnt wounded enough. I knew where this was going and was quick to pull out before being goaded into playing into it. so you dont believe in Sodom and Gammorah? she asks. no I dont. Hello? The most commonly brought-up passage of the bible to put gays out to rust in the rain? Fuck you!! So she goes on to my father, her obvious only ally Did you hear they passed some legislation paving the way for same-sex marriages in congress today? Or was it in California. This hostile, sickened look on her face. So fuck them both. I grabbed my glass of wine and my blanket (my back was screwed and I thought Id spend the night with them instead of hibernating upstairs), and I walked upstairs with a stoic face and a silence Ive worked on for years to manage without tears. We were having such a decent night together. Out of nowhere And with all thats going on, dont you think thered be a bit more sensitivity? Im appalled. Im sickened. This is yet another blow to my confidence. This illusory support system. Dont fucking hug me to make you feel better. Youre not on my side, and theres no trying to fool me after tonight. They let me walk out the door tonight 20 minutes later without an apology. Awful. Another abandonment. Welcome to hell.

 Up early and already the staring has begun. Part exhaustion, part depression, part Zoloft. Took my introductory dosage a couple of days ago, somehow crashing out immediately and slept for 13 hours. Feels a bit like coming down off of meth to be on this stuff. Tight jaw, nervous shivers, sweats, yawning and restless exhaustion, nausea and a disinterest in food. All except for the depression. I dont care suddenly that I feel awful. So far Ive been allowed to rejoin the world a bit with its help. Finished a quickie paper for a class that I didnt have the mental concentration to reread before calling it done. I have another book to read by noon and plans to do it whilst at the gym burning off the overflow of anxiety to prepare myself for going back to a class I disappeared from last week. Found someone good to go see yesterday. A woman in Old Town named Jill. Kind, smart, can keep up with me and shes gay. Less self-important than the other guy I was toying with seeing. Less ego, more real. Plus shes a woman. Back hurts. Time to pop some pills and head out.

 Worse. Everything is worse. I cant feel anymore. I missed my appointment today. I dont know how but I thought it was at 5 but it was 3. I missed it. Ive never done that before ever. I cant talk about it. Im ruined tonight. No one can help me, and its me whos helping that be real. How could I have fumbled the time? Im so out of it. Ashamed for wasting his time. Ashamed for slinking back into rush hour traffic from downtown la jolla with no solutions. No more hope than when I woke up this morning. tomorrow its to the hospital with mom. I need help.

 Another day of being broke, more bills piling up in the mailbox without a check from the insurance company to cover it. Not permitted to get a job, not able to cover even my minimum payments on my credit cards or to manage to keep my checking account balance in the black. Deposited a small check from selling a textbook, and it told me Id been in the negative again. How, I have no idea, nor do I have the energy to look into it. Just in case I freak out again. It was at the computer checking my finances that I did that. I know why men in debt kill themselves the insurance money, to save their families the pain of suffering through what mess theyve gotten themselves into. I know that helplessness. And I havent even amassed enough debt that selling my car wouldnt amend. Yet its the principle. Im trapped. Ive lost my way. Nothing I can really do besides shift the debt around to someone who wont charge me late fees, ruin my already ruined credit. How am I ever going to get out of this house without good credit? Another day desperate to cut myself but instead Im laughing tears of defeat. Cant hit my head against the wall. Thatll show bruises too hard to hide. Cant kick anything. Spraining my ankle will keep me from being able to get exercise. And then what?! Ill surely collapse. My stomach turns. Out of spite for myself and my situation, I make myself tea to better feel whats happening. Like, bring it on. Called the attorney again today. Directly speaking to anyone would be too much for them, apparently. Always getting his paralegal who doesnt give a shit about my situation. Either doesnt care or is too stupid to call my cell, the number I leave with him. Always calls the house. And then never has my file in front of him, so he has no idea whats going on. Guess he ought to call my house. More problems. My cell isnt working for some reason, although thats one bill Im current on. Not for long though, eh? Why cant I call out? I can receive calls. Not that Im getting any. No one at my attorneys office is taking me seriously. No one calls back until way later, and then they have nothing but were working on it to tell me. No one understands how this is making me feel. No one cares that Im helpless. Got the stitches out today. Looks like a horrendous scar Ive given myself. Wont that look pretty in a formal gown? Nothing is working. Deep denial of how crazed I feel is allowing me to get out the door now to make it to my psychiatrist appointment with Resnikoff in La Jolla. At least its got an ocean view, that place. I can get there early, sit in my parked car and cry my eyes out. But Ive got to get there first. I might as well be drunk if Im going to allow myself to drive with tear-clouded eyes. Im just as distracted. Whats next? Exactly how much more can I endure? I wish my back was better so I could pick up something really heavy and throw it. Preferably something made of glass so I can hear its destruction loud and clear. Shattered glass to scream for me.

 I have little to say at this early hour. What I can let you know is that the words are coming back to me. Driving home from Julian along the dirt road breathing in the beauty and generally pondering my navel, I realised I was writing in my mind again. But rather than capture it with clenched fists and try to get it down in ASCII as soon as possible before it all slipped away, I encouraged it to go. I cant keep clawing to hold onto these things. Any of it, high or low. Part of my despair stems from not being able to sit back and watch. Sure, Im withdrawing, but Im not unattached. Thanks, Kristen, for reminding me.

 Im giving this up until I have a home again. Keep your fingers crossed for me.

 Struggling to readjust to all thats happening. The word endurance flickering in my head over and over again like a sputtering flame. Assaults from all sides. Legal, financial, health, mental health and now its my family. My core support, right? Estranged suddenly from my mother, I cant bring myself to reengage with her and let it slide. Ive been doing that for nearly ten years now, allowing her to make me feel like a pariah for my sexuality, as if its a mark of mental dysfunction. I could attack her, Im so angry. Theres no excuse for what she did to me the other night, and theres no room to let her try again at this tender juncture with her track record for abusive comments. I simply cant let her near me. too dangerous. Still not a penny to play with. Worries about getting a check to my therapist on Wednesday. She doesnt take Visa. Which means Ill have to ask my mom for two hundred bucks for the past two sessions. Which means Ill have to talk to her. Maybe Ill send her an email since that seemed to be an acceptable medium for her apology. Ill send her an invoice in reply. Days without sunshine. Inhospitable for beach outings. Could use a little time on a towel. Computer problems. Something is wrong with it, but my brother is nowhere to be found. Guilty about asking him again to help fix it, knowing hes too busy as it is. Whatever.

 So nice to have my real keyboard and a desktop to screw around on. Thought Id give my aunt a break today and spend the night in my parents vacated house for a night. A quick hour on the freeway, and Im here. Stupid LA drivers getting into an accident near the Del Mar Fair, messing up traffic for miles. Idiots. Not much to say this afternoon. Spent the morning getting ahead on my school work for the week. Read a book this morning, wrote and submitted a paper. All from the comfort of a bed, not having to even get up to connect and send it out. Yep, its all about keeping my energy expenses at a minimum. Shell shocked with stress, keeping me focused on getting by, trying not to think of anything beyond a week in scope. Id keep the focus to the moment at hand, but I have enough appointments coming up to disorganise the best of people. Each one seems to hold the fate of the future, so I cant afford not to prepare myself. The scars on my body are clearing up. Trying desperately to find a therapist but finding nothing but more referrals. No one wants to take me on out of fear probably. Im a danger to myself, and no one can handle it. Its bullshit, and I need to figure something out fast. Fuck the whole therapeutic community for not being willing to help me. Phone conference with my attorney this Monday. 2 months without a payment from disability. 2 months of being blown off by his assistants saying theyre helping me but theyre not. More bills piling up. I cant talk about this or Ill send myself into a fit. I need a cigarette.

 Restless. Working hard not to cultivate a direction to my energy, hoping it slows down as the beer and pain pill wears on but its not working. A tiny amount of sleep last night and a big day spilling my guts in a therapy session that may or may not turn out to work for me. A super-charged workout to pour off the excess that did little more than stir the fire. I should sleep. At least theres Demi Moore on Letterman to lull me to sleep with visions of Claudia-like loveliness. Theres always imaginary connectedness to ease distress. God that husky voice and her luscious hair. Fake tits, no good. But that jaw linethose eyes. So Claudia. Im moving to Idaho. Or trying to move on, I dont know. Will I be able to rest up enough to get myself to class tomorrow? Can I manage being anywhere but in the safety of a school classroom? Today was difficult, running the gamut from solitary screams to myself, scurrying around with infinitely increasing fervour complicating my multi-taking frenzy to sitting in a poorly decorated office with a woman barely older than me wishing I had something sharp in my hand to break the tension. Maybe the fact that this therapist is so close in age, itll quell the tendency to assume patterns of projection onto an older, good-looking woman. I hope she can keep up with me and this doesnt become another running commentary, a solo project like this blog. God damn, Demi is stunning. I could just lick her raw. Good, hes making her answer questions about her little man boyfriend. Whos beautiful like a girl, but still sour grapes. I cant wait until Im 30 or am I switching my mantra now to 40? Alright, alright! Watching the latest episode of Out of Order tonight peaked my interest for taking ecstacy, missing that wonderful loving connectedness you feel with the grass under your feet and just about anything tangible that will allow you to touch it for an hour or longer. And interested in getting a full nights sleep. Its dramatised, I know. But its hitting close to home to see someone (the only other model I have to bounce this diagnosis off of) blunder through bipolar disorder. And then theres Justine Bateman on the show, high on E with Felicity Huffman and they didnt even kiss each other!! What the hell?! Throw me a bone I can chew on, folks! Are some people really that sexually circumscribed that they wouldnt even make love to someone of the same/opposite sex under special circumstances? These things are beyond me. Theres a boy who agrees with me asking me to meet him for a drink on Wednesday. And yes, Ive already slept with him. Doesnt mean were involved. Does mean I need to be clear once more about my position. the last thing I want is to hurt someone sweet. Albeit someone who deserves a smack for his foul-up a few months ago. I forgive. Neko Case showed up on Letterman last week and I have it on tape. When I get a sex drive again after the Zoloft, Ill consider it erotic fodder I can use. Shit. I have to be in class in 11 hours. Ill need at least 15 to catch up with sleep. ?? Fingers crossed. An internet connection by the morning to post this. Thanks for checking in! Apologies for the hiatus.

 Frustrating waste of time! Online searches of self-inflicted violence in hope of finding a listing of therapists who specialise in the disorder. Tracy Alderman rules the kingdom (and lives in SD!), but I cant seem to find any contact information for her afraid this is because she no longer takes on patients. Just writes books and consults. I left a message with another woman who I see co-wrote another book with her on dissociative identity disorder, hoping that maybe either she can help me or point me in the right direction. Why cant anyone help me?! Silly people not calling me back like Karen who dumped me in the first place. She said she had another name in mind and was going to call her and then call me about it. A week later, I still hadnt heard anything back from her, even with a call from me to follow up on it. All the names on the list of references given to me by Jill, the last therapist to pass me on, ended up to be dead-ends. And then even Sherri Kaplan, my moms tennis friend whos also a therapist, gave me a couple of names either no longer practising or no longer taking new patients. Nothing, nothing, nothing. Eyeing my scars and wishing I could cut again without it showing. Alcohol blunting the focus, buying me time until I can figure something out. I feel awful.

 260 dollar cell phone bill paid off. Looks like the upheaval of moving and being dependent on its use lead me to ring it up pretty bad. But since I FINALLY got my long-awaited check from the insurance company, I can hardly complain about the expense. So long as it doesnt happen again. Bills, bills, and more bills. Sending out fat checks to creditors, both banks and friends who Ive lagged on paying back. Feels fantastic not to be behind anymore. Itll feel even better when I have a reasonable savings account balance built up. Whens that settlement going to come? A place to live. And not just mooching off the good nature of friends and family. Although I suppose you could still call it that. My parents decided on a condo this weekend, a brand new place near school out here in San Marcos. Being so close by will surely bolster my academic profile. Made the deans list last semester. Would be a shame not to repeat that. I think the place will be ready in August or early September. I cant wait to attack Ikea for good ol cheap-ass shit. Two more class meetings before the end of the first summer session. Three days off and then another two classes start. Can I manage two at a time? So much reading and paper writing. Then again, Ill be that much closer to finishing having knocked out nine units over break. Im a little out of my head as far as my ability to put thoughts down onto paper. I hope that subsides as I get more and more used to all this medication. Got a class to attend in a few, then to home to work on a paper with a Thursday deadline. Id planned to go out for dinner tonight, but that cell phone bill put me out of the mood.

 If it wasnt the last night that Amys in town, I definitely wouldnt be leaving the house. A fun afternoon after watching a b-ball tourney and again at Bryans house for a burgroid, and I still drive home with the sinking low of depression. I just want to shut the doors and go back to sleep in hope that Ill wake up feeling a bit more enthused. But it doesnt happen. Slept 13 hours last night, and that was after a 3 hour nap in the middle of the day. Yes, followed by a 12 hour sleep the night before. Its not as if Im catching up for anything. Just a bunch of stress. Trying to fend off the imaginary army coming to conquer my giving a shit. Losing my best friend tomorrow. Tonight actually. She leaves at 4am Sunday. For 6mo, but it feels like its going to be longer than I can imagine. Must be the additional loss I cant conceptualise. Im like her shadow on the weekends, social calendar mirroring whatever plans she may have made during the week. Weekends. My only time out, it seems. Having anything to actually do during the week provides me with a valid excuse for not coming out to play. But now? Im sad there will be one less at my condo warming party. And one less option for a housemate. Shes the only one I talk to about all the stupid shit I do, all the horrible nightmares Im plagued with, the darkness that I wake up with and work to forget through the course of the day. Life /is/ loss. Even when it allows for new and better things to appear, it sucks and I hate adjusting. Hyper-vigilance failed me this week. Usually so aware of my environment. Kitty sneaking into my room in the dark, me not knowing. Fell asleep only to find a screen in the room pushed out by sweet Forward. A cat lost to the wilderness that surrounds my aunts house. Desperate self-loathing for my mistake. My lack of knowing. Even though the other cat scratched the shit out of me the day before when it slunk through the cracked door and I caught it from hiding under the bed indefinitely. Aching back and hamstrings from walking the neighbourhood and driveway of an unknown grade. Hitting myself in the head in desperation, trying in vain to punish myself adequately. But I found a way to get back at myself. Alienated someone I respect (mostly) with a drunken email revealing a crush I have on her. Poor woman. I knew I was indulging a bit more than I needed to with details of my no-longer-private longings. Poor woman. 50% self-gratification for entertaining lustful imaginings good enough to get me through a rough day, 50% self-destructive tendencies to make myself cower in guilt the next day for my expositions. 100% achievement. Guilt like mad. Heavily weighted spirits, a thin veil of functionality to cover the underlying cry of surrender to defeat. Even the best of times is mired by a crushing sense of bleak futility to drive me home. Sleep is my refuge. More time is spent asleep than awake. 13hours a night plus naps. And Im still tired. cant sleep without help. Sleep at all, and I cant get enough. Thank god for sleeping pills. Accelerated occurrences of nightmares. Things so traumatic, I wake up in a sweat crying out loud. Things so realistic, it takes me time to sort out what actually happened the day before and what didnt. crying with grief over the dead bodies I walk through, crying with frustration for the body I cant use anymore, crying with the sting of rejection of the women I fall for, and hurting myself bloody images Id rather not recount in case they come back into my consciousness tonight. I want to sleep some more, but I want more to spend more time with Amy before I lose her. Not that shes going to be incommunicado, but she will be in Barbedos. Its not a days drive away or anything. Shes good. I love her. She needs this, and I couldnt be happier for her save for how much I need her around me.



 Oh boy, oh boy. Nothing like going out to a killer restaurant with the whole family where I can actually order sushi and no one in our party will complain about the offerings! Im still baffled by the lack of interest my fam seems to have for raw fish. I could eat hamachi for every meal if somehow I could afford to. But cheer up! Going with the family means I dont have to take out a loan to pay the bill! urlLink Cafe Japengo! Check out the bounty! A somewhat productive day reading up on the boys, Plato, Longinus, and Plotinus. Sketched out my paper in a skeleton of evidence from their respective works. All I have to do tomorrow is add some meat to it. No problem. Its that disengaged-voice kind of writing thats so easy to whip out in a short time. Even if the ideas are a bit intellectual. But for now, I cast the books aside, even the Jared Diamond I snuck in for fun, and prepare for an afternoon of gluttony to rival all others. Luis and Chris are organising a champagne BBQ at the Weez house. Ive marinated a boat load of tiger shrimp in a light terriaki sauce to later be coated in sesame seeds and skewered along with pearl onions for BBQ bliss. Simple, but fantastico. The more involved I get in honing my abilities in the kitchen, the more value I place on simplicity and freshness of ingredients when grading my creations. Luis is making some puff pastry meat concoction and assorted nibblies to snack on. Grazing on light bits of flavour is where its at. Now its time to create a bit of a mixed CD to fuel my fire on the way down there. C drive, dont fail me now.

 feels appropriate after last night's blog to post a picture of ms. neko. et voila!

 Another enjoyable night with the Weez-man drinking wine and eatin some grilled goodies. Too bad his workmate started to irritate me beyond my capacity to take drama. And anyway, Id burned myself a new Neko Case CD of various tunes from albums and lovely live takes that I couldnt wait to get back into my car to enjoy. Silently wishing I had a sex drive despite all the medication. I was half in the mood to spend the night with luis after indulging in a little sing-along with the venerated ms. Neko. Shes such a fox. And such an incredible voice on that woman. I cant believe shes not worldwide, save for the story I heard about her taking her top off at the Grand Ol Oprey. Guess thatll squeltch your chances at making it big in the uptight country industry. It only takes a distant, hazy fantasy of being with a woman I adore to carry me through the act with a man. When youre tragically single, thats the best that can come of it living in the straight world that I do. Why does the Zoloft rob me of my wantings? Does it have to include the valued ones? Is that the story, all those needs that pose a threat to my stability fall away in favour of a numbed stasis of emotion? What about the sexual prowess that so defines my sense of self? True, the wants and cravings are misdirected and largely unfulfilled. But that doesnt mean my sense of fantasy has to drown along with it. At least I could have the wish to be with myself. But nothing for months now. And thats outright depressing. Recent events have turned my head again towards the mental imagery Ive invented about poor Kristen, my ex-history teacher. For reasons of there being no one else in my current dealings that can take on the role of a lustful focus. And partly to assuage my failings at negotiating that crush to its quiet conclusion. I want to apologise to her further, but I know its too late. Had my intention been only to flatter, I wouldnt be still concerned with her. But a part of that was a power play to dominate her after all the back-and-forth of offence and reconciliation, and I know it. Still, I have to have someone in mind to imagine spooning me at night as I fall asleep. And she is pretty foxy with those knee-high boots she wore to class. Word to the wise, women who wish not to incite my sexual wrath: Dont wear those things. And dont assume a power position over me either, no matter your footwear. Its inescapable and apparently a dangerous place to be put in. I suppose part of the advantage of being queer is the seeing yourself in the mirror and having a different level of appreciation for whats reflected than others might have. Assuming my body reflects an ideal. Which it does these days, I suppose, save for a radiant scar or two on my left forearm. Where does that get filed away in my mental processes? Its on the same page as the other admonitions for wanting something most dont long for. Its my punishment for my lusts. Its a wonder its my arm and not my naked body that bears the signifiers of anguish. Neko. Button on my backpack. CD to lull me into emotional wants, not enough to overcome the physical barriers to my human longings. Disconnected to myself indefinitely. True, lasting connections happen outside of lustful wants. But do they ignite without that passionate step? Am I securing my short-term solitude by continuing to take this stuff? Is it serving me well to provide a grace period away from my seemingly poisonous needs? Whos going to want someone as damaged as I am? Best to work on this alone for a time. Reinvest in others when Im older. More settled somehow. I miss being someones girl. And all that goes with it. I miss Claudia and our connectedness. I miss loving someone. And truly feeling that passion returned to me. I hope Charlie is happy. Boy, oh boy am I glad I'm not in his shoes though.

 Lounging in the leather chair Im missed sitting in for the last month, the synthetic groove of Mum and Sigur Ros sounding better than ever, bringing with each song the vivid memories of London and Bolzano strong enough to send chills through me. Somehow the memories are more troubling and anxious than I would think appropriate for my little sojourns to Europe over the past couple of years. Must be the burdensome beauty in the music that seems too tragic and heavy to allow for any enraptured release to come from my recollections. And the release is what Im after today. Feeling fussy, a little too worried for what the circumstances warrant. Maybe a change of song, a change of tone. Ive a mind to spend the day burning CDs and reading for fun, casting off my homework responsibilities for the weekend. Find a comfortable spot in the grass and surrender to the day, stop my attempts to manage the moment with doing. The Jared Diamond books making their way around the family and now to me. Been meaning to get to Guns, Germs, and Steel for months now. And then theres Benedict Andersons Imagined Communities that I wish I had in my arsenal for use in papers for school - and my general knowledge base for that matter. A bit more heady than casual afternoon reading usually calls for. I might as well capitalise on the push to educate myself before the lull of late afternoon robs me of my drive to engage. A brief but intense workout at the gym. Anger building, seemingly from nowhere, sapping my endurance and sending me into a premature state of exhaustion. So some more sit-ups and a long, indulgent stretching session as I hummed quietly to myself and shut out the discontent. Must be the release of endorphins and the moving of lingering chemicals that stockpile in a static body that caused such a reaction. Yet it didnt happen during yesterdays sweat. Perhaps it was a touch of frustration showing itself for not keeping up on my regimen as I think I should. Living so far from my day-to-day routine threw me off. But now, now Ill pick up where I left off. Plans tonight for the pairing of wine and a grill over at Luis house. Our mutual friend, Chris, is moving across the country in a couple of weeks to get married and start a new life. Our collective mission in the mean time: drink as much good wine together as possible. Not the noblest of pursuits, but it sounds like the most logical course of action. Another one leaving. Troubling, but nothing compared to Amys departure. Maybe a nap sounds better than reading after all. Sleep. The cure-all.

 Another extended break in between classes is proving to be just the ticket to reconsider sticking around for the second round of school. Havent eaten yet today, couldnt get up and out of the house (and off instant messenger with Amy) in time to hit the gym as planned. What good is it to get there for a mere 30 minute sweat and have a traffic jam to contend with on my way to classes? I prefer the relaxation of being 20 minutes early to school to prep my brain for literary criticism discussions. It takes more than a cup of coffee and a brisk shower to get my brain wanting to think about the nature of art. It takes a reread and a moment of quiet in the car. Dreary day seducing me back to the quiet of the house and the solitude of homework paper writing. A batch of French onion soup to warm me and perfume the house. Seems I have to wait a little while today before that can happen the folks arent leaving for Julian until a bit later on when the temperature has dropped below 90. cant say I blame them. Yet it has been a few days since Ive had the luxury of withdrawal. Falling behind on my blogging, a flurry of mental activity propelling me back. Seems Ive been able to negotiate the adjustment to all this medication, restoring my mental capacity to its normal range. Its a good thing too. What good are anti-depression measures if I have no voice? The upcoming weekend is soon to be, and I couldnt care less. No Amy equals no plans. I expect to at least sit down to email her in the coming days to augment the IM sessions. What a dreaded distance her job has wedged between us. I suppose this will open me up to explore other social outlets that have been neglected. Or better yet, give me more time to study and work at my writing without the impetus to leave the house each night. Being cloistered away in my den upstairs doesnt sound too bad at all. Just wish she was home on the weekends like before. Time to sweat it out and catch up on my reading. About 700 pages to read by Wednesday. And a paper due on the position of Audience in Classical and Renaissance Literary Criticism. Oooo FUN!

 Silly blogspot changing the interface so I cant figure out how to change my HTML template. The link to it isnt loading. I suppose I could check their tech support site and be assuaged by their acknowlegements of the problem theyre working on. Whatever. Another sick picture isnt completely necessary. The night winding down for me. my sweet casey dog in my bed, freshly washed from joining me in the shower. Freshly washed sheets to drown myself in, a faint wafting of bleach to calm my soul. Clean! I even took a shower today! Albeit after a couple of days. Having a couple of beers, flipping through the channels now that Ive completed my homework for tomorrows literary commentary class. What do I find after my compulsory nightly Seinfeld episode? The notoriously high-brow FOX network is airing this disgusting bit of entertainment called Stupid People Caught on Tape or something to that effect. What a sorry state this country is in when this kind of crap makes the grade for prime-time programming. Then again, Ive been singing the same song since Friends made its first appearance. Who can stand that crap?! Id rather watch a Terminator movie or something equally low on any reasonable taste measure. Preferably one with Linda Hamilton. Man, I had a crush on her in jr. high. Think it was the SNL appearance. Oh, and the pull-ups scene. Tough chicks. I dig. So Tony Blair Wowed! a joint session of congress today. And you know, I actually dont have something cynical to say to discredit the mans efforts to speak up and speak out. Some may point to the stark contrast between this man and our own countrys president the fresh breeze brought by someone with such a markedly superior command of an audience as a public speaker. Bush is so incredibly inept at communicating with the public. It may not be an accurate measure to judge someone, but we assume a correlation between the competency of others and their ability to communicate. Im not even a republican, but I still cringe in empathetic embarrassment each time that mans face pops into the little lighted box in my room and I see his lips move. As a matter of humanistic compassion. No wonder liberals feel like the election was stolen from ding-dong, sing-song Gore. But whos worse?! To the both of you: Hire a speech writer who can coach you to deliver their material with a dignity suitable for a world leader!! And with that, I crack open my last cold one of the night and hit the sheets. Got to be up early to make it to the gym before school commences. Time to dig in deeper, break through that barrier of fitness I seem to have hit, stuck without significant improvement after the weeks and weeks of work. More. Im ready.

 HOO-RAY! I'm gay too! What am I grateful for? One, my car didnt get towed from an almost-red parking spot. And two, that I was able to park it AND get it home without overheating. Silly thing. I saw the gauge when I got down there at 9am this morning. Never seen my car threaten me to overheat before. Suspect, indeed. Ill have to get that looked at this week. Whilst mom and dad will help me pay for the repairs. And what did I come away with this afternoon? Hmmm, lets see Ive got some stickers in here, about a gallon worth of lube in handy little individual packets. Um beer. Got that. Um and a new purple vibe to substitute for the pinky that no longer hums as advertised. Madon! It's much more lovely than the old kitty. Stand aside for the new purple bunny! Blister potential in my little feet-sies after walking a good 5 miles+ from the parking spot to the parade to the festival and back. Lotion lubricating the sore suckers as I type. Hip flexors and legs aching from all the travel. Im a touch inebriated, or Id write a bit more. About all the old friends/acquaintances I ran into, all the glory of walking the parade route holding our schools banner, hootin and hollerin at the crowd in celebration. I think Ill set the Tivo to local news shows tonight see if we made it to the networks. Lord, I need a BBQ. Shish kabobs a la lesbian. Or just my burrito en fuego hell. Yup. 5-Alarm. i'm dying here.

 Dewd. I didnt realise this until todays required reading for my literary commentary class. The site, this blog its named as homage to Woodys Manhattan . Yes, Ive said this before. The scene is the one in the art gallery with Mary Wilke (Dianne Keaton) talking smack about the crap work thats on display. 13 minutes into the film for those keeping score. About the steel cube on display downstairs, she says, to me, that was brilliant. It had a marvellous sort of negative capability. It was perfectly integrated the rest of the stuff was bullshit. Negative Capability, according to Keats, means the vacuum left by the auteur when creating his work, requiring the audience to supply her own judgement and conscience to determine what morals and meaning are meant to be deduced. Or as he states the definition of negative capability to be, when man is capable of being in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact & reason (Richter 333). The phrase/literal is clear enough, but the significance takes some teasing out of the context. Lovely. Nothing like formal education to bleed over into real life. Going out to dinner with pally-wally Chris. Designs to hit the Spirit of Stonewall rally in Balboa Park, the precursor to the parade and festival. But it doesnt look like Ill get there/have the huevos to go it alone. I vote for beer and vittels. Works Cited Richter, David H. John Keats. The Critical Tradition: Classic Texts and Contemporary Trends , 2nd ed. Boston: Bedford Books, 1998. 333-334.

 FYI: Ghost World is on a cable movie channel tonight. Check local listings. Who can't relate to this horror?

 Nightly Simpsons episode to ease the stress right out of me. Not that the day was much of a stress. Just did homework and hit the gym for an extra long workout. And IMed Amy for a while, collaborating with schedules and information trying to book a cheap flight to Barbados. Guess what! We got me one! Itinerary as follows: 2:30am Tuesday, August 19th. Leave my house for LAX. 7:40am Flight to Miami. 8:45pm Arrive on the island. Ill be a long day, but since I enjoy plane travel so much, it wont be a bother. And lord, Ive got Amy to look forward to! And the sun and sand of a cute little tropical island for days and days! I dont come home until the 28th!! Hooray for holidays! And hooray for exercise to tone the bod in time for several days in a bikini. Got to keep up the shape in case there will be fuckables on the island. Ive my priorities in order, you betcha. Wandered downstairs for a glass of wine tonight only to be sucked into the yelling-at-the-telly session with mom and dad. Outraged as usual at the network news editorials that colour the presentation of the stories. Commentary so obviously slanted, I cant believe folks trust these heads. My dads right either state your bias or can the adjectives. Watching this shit frustrates me.

 Commenting on this image is probably not necesary, Unless you're in the business of explaining to your young son Why Not to join the Boy Scouts or side with the Alter Boys. What am I thinking about? Trying to get to sleep when theres so much national news to comment on?! No, it didnt take me until now to flip on a cable news show. I had the visuals turned on the flatscreens in front of me at the gym, as my ears bled from the high decibles of Dirty Vegas and Outkast tunes. Multi-tasking. Feelin a little shaky about democracy in these here United States. And it aint the Zoloft or alcohol! A near fist fight on Capital Hill last week, now a murder in the city council of New York this morning That Grey Davis is being recalled is my only salvation, the f-ing weiner. If I was a dem, Id be ashamed. The audio tapes catching his crew proposing to extend the deficit problem longer than necessary for political-pull reasons really capped the situation. That fuck is SO for sale, and his political lifespan is his only motivation. Good-fucking-riddance. But... Pray we dont go through what Minnesota had to endure with that wrestler dude. Take a poll, republican party. When you hear the name Arnold Schwarzenegger, how many can honestly say, in their first twenty descriptive adjectives, who can manage to say smart or educated??? The Catholic archdiocese is in big fucking trouble, but it seems after today that, despite the preventative/punishment measures that were going to be taken, theyre not enough. Hearing people screaming anger and desperation on NPR today, sound bytes from some protest I sink in shame for these victims. Sink in shame since the culprits dont appear theyll be doing as much after being let off the hook. Fucking criminal charges not being pursued. Id be screaming too!! Young people being sexualised by authority figures. That being glossed over just because theyre clergy. We should pass a law where all catholic clergy must own a gun. To facilitate suicides, of course, and save taxpayers from having to try, convict, and prosecute these fucks.

 Lord, Im tuckered out. Spent two hours at the gym today an hour on the elliptical, twenty on the bike for warm-up, 100 sit-ups, lats, arms, quads, hams Woke up from a coma this morning thanks to Elavil. Could hardly move. I took one of those already tonight for dessert. I cant wait til it kicks in, taking with it my chance to wake up at two in the morning with excessive worry. Got an email from Kristen. A good sport. She said nothing about my email. Thank god. Remorse isnt good for my stomach. Looks like Ill be in Barbados by the 18th of this month. Amy, bless her heart, has offered to let my plane trip be her first comp-ed airline ticket. I cant WAIT to get my little self into that water, to be Amys maid for a week, to get on a flight and out of this country for a while. Using my passport gratifies me like few other things can. I dont think they let lesbians into the country, so Ill have to find me a beautiful island man to fuck around with while Im there. Word on the street is that Effexor doesnt affect your sex drive. Lord almighty, Im going to go on a tear!! Emails to friends have my fingers tired of whomping away at the keyboard here. But then again, what else am I going to do? Im mid-cycle with my laundry. Cant sleep yet even if I wanted to. Did a little walk-through at the condo today with the folks. Cant tell you whether its going well or not or even what the hell theyre doing. Thank Dad for understanding all the technical talk. My mom and I just took a good look at the views, the kitchen sink/stovetop proximity to the view really technical scrutiny. I cant wait. Thankfully, Ill have a trip to an island to help break up the waiting with something super wonderful.

 Went for another meds eval this afternoon. Seems the muscle spasms Im experiencing is not a good sign according to this medical professional. Really? I only wake myself up 40 times a night when my body shakes. Since Im on the highest dose possible without any real relief from my compulsions, hes taking me off of Zoloft and putting me on Effexor. I think I took this once back in high school, but I cant be sure. About anything that happened within those few years. More Elavil for sleep. And of course Noodle house in Kerney Mesa with Bryan after the appointment. Dingy little dump of a storefront on Convoy, the place looking like a conversion from a cultural-relic diner built back in the 60s. Bbut the place was packed and pretty cheap, so what am I being critical for? Got to catch up on my Tivo recordings. "Sex in the City," a Neko appearance on some MTV show, "Sopranos" reruns that never get stale. Maybe even a "Curb" episode made it on there. Adieu.

 More indecision standing in the chilled airspace before an open subzero leads me to bypass yet another meal in favour of a dry crappaccino from starbucks. Coming in here to pay tribute to my favourite coffee slut, Bryan, working the night shift at the Bad Place. Hearing tales of his days dental appointment involving abscesses and root canal procedures kind of sealed the deal on the whole eating question. Gro-oss. Suppose its just as well. Foods been a mere afterthought for days now, feeling the rising tide of baseless energy swelling beneath my feet. Commence Operation Upward Swing. Man your battle stations. Like yall cant tell from the blogging spree. Seems a touch milder this time around at least. I can sleep. Failings of will encumbering my high spirits on the drive over here. Thoughts of Claudia creeping back into my head now that Im back living in my old haunt. The ever-present compulsion to scan the landscape for the car, that green land cruiser, partly out of habit, partly out of curiosity and ok, partly out of longing. Its the latter that struck me sideways. How many years do I have to endure this before I stop loving her? I know, I know soon Ill live in San Marcos a ways away from our neighbourhood and not have this problem sting me with such acute precision. And yes, I can clearly see the circumstances that precipitate these waves of exhilarating nostalgia. Amy is gone. Lonely as all hell. Thats a big part of why Im writing so much. And further, the disconnect from my aunt now that Im not living there anymore. Such a valued ally, no longer in my day-to-day doings. And too, the last session with my massage therapist was today. Warm hands are a good thing, you know? Especially from a sweet and pretty young woman named Jennifer. And yes, L5/S1 is pretty much my butt. Tee-hee-hee. Seems my MD prescribed a max of two months of massage treatment after being declared permanent and stationary. Two months! Hardly better, yall! Im still downing pain pills like tic-tacs. Medicating with frosty malted adult beverages when the situation permits the departure from reality. Draining my bank account to cover bar tabs and therapy bills. Its all about pain avoidance, right? Wish there were some more solid preventative measures set in place to assuage my fears of things just sliding further, adding to the laundry list of things creeping up and laying me out flat. Even the mundane shit weighs more in the atmosphere of this planet. Getting on the freeway going south on the 5 at Manchester, I groaned to myself for having to file behind a big stinkin truck spewing all sorts of crap into the air, spoiling the perfectly pleasant cigarette I was huffing on. Grinding down to a mere 65 mph hampering my style like a burr in my panties and then a frickin rock kicks up from under his back tire and smacks my hood, off my windshield, and over the roof. Wha-th-f-?! Just what I need to have my car start looking like Noriegas cheeks. But alas. Some kiss of grace spared my Maxima the stigma of more battle scars (it's looking pretty good, yo). Yet that poor car needs a relief pitcher to step in before the score gets out of hand. Oh, but cheer up young buck! Tis the time of year for the Acura Tennis Classic to return to the La Costa Spa and Resort! A mere week away, and my head will be filled with visions of fit young women drenched in sweat. Mom got some incredible tickets in the VIP box, and she invited me to go with her and her pal Gail on Tuesday, the day where everyone plays and the practise courts are abuzz with activity you can peek in on through the gaps in the windscreens. Oh, holy days of womens tennis!! (panting, flushed with excitement) The run-in with Steffi whetted my appetite for the star-struck splendour that makes the week such a kick in the pants. Alright, y'all. Time to watch sportscenter and watch the replays of Lance Armstrong's valiant struggle to overcome the blunder of that STUPID fan that knocked him off the bike. I hope he's French. Would make for more grounded verbal assaults when the time comes to rant about it.

 Things heating up in Liberia. The name Chuck Taylor has expanded significance beyond those crappy, blister-bustin' shoes since all this began to blow up. See? Everything comes back to footwear... More sticky political negotiations round the world. Never ending geopolitical strife. So, Chuck is refusing to leave the country until international peacekeepers arrive to enable the transition of power to take place peacefully. Meaning American troops. Look, guy. Number one, were spread too thin as it is. And two, why dont you ask the UN to supply peacekeepers?!! Or dont they matter anymore? Yes, I'm war weary. Enough already! I can't handle anymore, let alone our military. Off to the post office to pick up a certified letter that had been waiting for me all week. Seems TJs is cancelling my insurance as of the end of the month. Lovely. Something smacks of injustice here. I cant /work/ and therefore cant /afford/ to either go uninsured or find another job that will reinstate medical coverage. My feeling is this: wait until my settlement. Cut me loose, and Ill gladly accept all that the independence entails. Tantrum central in the post office, the scene of screamers spilling out into the parking lot. Waiting in line, I could hear the howling getting closer until the door finally opened and the decibel level hit into my inner brain. The patiently waiting crowd quiet groans in the queue, desperate for either the line to hurry up or the kids parent to whack little Susie into behaving properly in public. The entire time, this little brat /screamed/ away while her mother stood silently beside her. And as if that wasnt enough to disrupt the tune-out session that usually characterises an errand like hitting the post office In comes another one! Good god, its my turn at the counter. Quick! Sign the stupid card, grab the letter and run. Run! The postal worker shoots me a glance, corroborating my irritation. Then a chuckle. I mumble to her, None for me, thanks. She gets my drift and we share another chuckle. Then out the door. Where I find Susie #2s little sister!! Yep, sitting in a protesting, arms-folded, Indian-style posture near the front door refusing to even come in with Daddy, shes so pissed. Also screaming, eyes filled with fury. Good god, could I ever have kids? Would they live past the age of eight? What a bunch of incorrigible brats. Felt like going up to each one of them and whispering in their little ears, you know, if you dont stop crying, the government is going to come to your house tonight and take you away to an orphanage. Ah, Im serene. Perhaps Ill go on out to the Y for a sweat.

 A brush with stardom never hurts when capping off a near perfect meal out with the family. A luscious meal at Caf Japengo with my parents, brother, and Axia spilled into the patio outside as we waited for our party to gather before we finally departed, bellies full of fresh fish and lemongrass-coconut crme brulee. As we stood there chatting it up, I look up in time to notice the couple walking in. I noticed her first, hard not to notice having looked at this face for years and years on the telly with eyes of worship. Stephi Graf and Andre Agassi walking into the restaurant after us!! Heads down somewhat, dressed inconspicuously in casual attire. I love her!! She's my sports-girl-Elvis! The thrill of it brought such a smile to my face. And luckily it didnt throw me off to where I changed my demeanour or spoke up in any way. Larger than life. Literally. She's kinda tall! God, she's an icon in my little book of studs. Oh, and he's a bit of a living legend himself. sheesh. Very cool indeed. I would have felt bad to pull them out of their incognito night out. They live a couple of miles away from my parents now that they moved to san diego. But what a kick in the pants to be out and see them like that. Guess thats what you get when you go to a killer restaurant. I was wondering how long it would be until I saw them around town. Steffi is a machine, the best legs tennis has ever seen. If ever the term power couple has been employed, this is the quintessential example. Unfortunately the night was marked by a worse-than-usual bout of back pain brought on by a six-hour paper writing session. Two large Sapporos and a pain pill that still had me needing a pair of aspirin, and I was finally feeling at ease. At least the paper is done and not too bad considering the topic is rather out of my usual topic comfort zone. And now I sit in the parking lot of the neighbourhood pool alone with my laptop, some beer, and American Spirits. The mix CD Id made for last nights trip to Luis house, the tunes that I made to fuel my flight down there. Bits of Sades newest album on the player right now, the last glow of evening light fading in the sky above me through the open sunroof. Pretty great day in total. To top a good night with friends last night that had everything from great food, champagne wine and beer, and even iced with the somewhat vague memories of being in the pool naked by the nights conclusion. So what if no one joined me? It felt fantastic to glide through the warm water unencumbered. Grilled tiger shrimp marinated in soy vay. Pastry shells filled with shrimp bisque or some variation of it. Vegetable and spicy sausage skewers in between, grilled to perfection. A little veuve cliquot and the like. Some sunshine enough to lend a touch of pink to my already bronzed skin. A good time, no doubt. What conversation did not make it to the table this evening had to do with a phone call I received this afternoon from a friend named matt. He called to inquire about my plans for Gay Pride this upcoming weekend. Hes the president of the university Gay and Lesbian group. Yes, the same group I vowed not to resume a connection with. But this is different. It seems this weekend, the whole group is going to be a part of the parade. Not just a part but were actually going to be /marching/ in it. Yeehaww!!! So I told him Id be there, no problem. Id planned to make it down there, but I wasnt sure that they were still planning to be a part of the festivities. So yay! If you see me on the news next Saturday night, Ill be the one flashing the crowd or walking with nothing but flip-flops and body paint. Man, do you still get arrested for being nude in public? SF Pride is so different. You can walk around topless all day, and no one will ask a thing. Should be a blast. If they show up when expected Im sad to have so much reading to do for my classes this summer now that I allowed myself a 50-page sneak-peak into the long-awaited Guns, Germs, and Steel. How much fun is this book?! Cultural anthropology is such a fun area to study anyway, but this book encapsulates, albeit briefly, the entire history of humanity. Highlighting the factors that lead to the development of various societies, their success dependent on a myriad of factors, spelling out the fate of societies today in light of their respective advantages and disadvantages. From timing to resources, to the availability of draft animals and paper, to the diseases that interrupted the natural course of events. Truly interesting reading. And not that elitist intellectual language that keeps certain works out of the simple level of understanding that an overview like this warrants. Nice to have more neutral things to talk about with the family, also big fans of Jared Diamond. Ill have to set aside time to work on finishing this thing. Ah, the time. More things keeping me from blogging as I long to. But hey Ive done a pretty good job in the recent past getting this thing going again. Even revamping the look of it, adding silly shit like the WOO-WOO guy. More to come. Hopefully as trite as the way it has always been. Got to have the entertainment factor along with the serious, real life commentary. Alas, my bladder cannot hold out any longer. Time to save to disk and make my way up the hill to the homestead. Ill have to make this hideout a habit. This was good

 Im torn. What seems so off-putting for its stereotypes I feel like a naughty queer for liking this show. Im talking about Bravos series, Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. Its horrible the way a couple of these guys flit around not for the flitting, but for the images that I just know are burning into the minds of people who dont have a diverse enough perspective to temper the one-sidedness. And it makes straight guys look like fools. Is that incorrect? Why I like it? Because I too am about to have a home of my own, and Im just dying to have an ace in my pocket in terms of decorating the place. Hip, affordable, not everything from Ikea Where can I saddle up on some killer paint colours? Who can help me throw it up? Mind you, I have plenty of ideas about what I want to do with this place. But its the finances and the resources of sheik decorating stores that have me in a bind. Gridlock traffic on the I5 South from 8am until now, 6:50pm and will probably remain so into the night. I guess this is the downside of living in paradise. That and the median home prices resting around 350,000. 82 and dry (finally no rain or mugginess!!) with a 70 water temperature. Another hour on the elliptical today, then 150 sit-ups. Feeling so fit after this hard week of work. And flexible, thanks to the reminders from Natalie. Two weeks until seeing Amy in Barbados. Two weeks until I get to hand out in a bikini from dawn to dusk. Spent a little time in the sun this afternoon too. A couple of hours in the summer loveliness reading Kate Chopin for the second time. Smoking smokes and nuzzling into the steamy grass. Just enough time to tan, no burn, and set up an even better base for the upcoming trip. Sushi with Bryan at 5pm in Carlsbad to give him a break from moving into his new place. Came home on the backroads to circumvent the traffic, changed into jeans and flopped down on the bed with the remote in my hand, debating whether to nap, open a beer, or just sit still. A little of all the above options, I guess. But alas, my downtime is over. Im expected to make an appearance at Luis house in a few. In less time than its going to take to get down there.

 Ok, so I leave my house tonight at 9:30 with every intention of going off to Martini Ranch to pay a visit to Scott whos bar backing for the night. I turn left onto Manchester going east, expecting to take the mostly-shorter cut to the bank in the centre of town. Rolling down the windy road, I start to imagine the toll taken by drinking needless drinks at a bar Im otherwise uninterested in being at. Not just the money, although thats what I was thinking of first and foremost. Theres a trip to Barbados on the near horizon to plan for. A night humming quietly to myself must be the order of the day if Im expecting to save a few all-important pennies. But the weight factor. Oh lord, have I ever been kicking it up a notch at the gym each day. True, this isnt as much as I managed whilst at my old haunt, Frogs in Encinitas. But then again, there arent any ex-lovers at the YMCA. Still, after three weeks of minimal effort, Ive jumped back up to 2-hour sessions each day of mostly cardio and a ton of sit-ups. Coming off of that high to a bunch of carbo-rich adult beverages doesnt seem logical. I came home from the gym today a bit light-headed. Thought it was the exertion or the fatigue of having gotten up early and endured two tougher than usual class sessions at the think tank. But then I realised Id only eaten about 200 calories since I woke up, and according to the machines and their calibrations, Id burned over 1000 calories in a cardio frenzy. So yeah, I was shaking so bad, I was unsure if Id be able to take a shower or walk downstairs to make some food substantial enough to quell the quaking. Lying wet and naked on my bed trying to reason it out until I finally sucked it up and made an attempt. And what do you know? Stuffing my face like Anna Nicole did the trick as quickly as my blood could run from my stomach to my brain. Didnt expect to be up for much tonight, all things considered. The day at school was engaging but at one point evocative of anger and embarrassment. So it was a touch more taxing than my usual state of being a few heartbeats away from a coma. This girl in my 4-person group was supposed to present our discussion on Nietzsche and his argument for the mythical return to the primordial Oneness as embodied by the Apollonian and the Dionysian unity. Which I clearly understand, but that doesnt mean that within a seconds notice Im able to formulate an oral argument to the class. She claimed the day was hers to speak, and then when it came time to do it, she looked at me and said simply, Charlotte? Shit. I faltered, admitting that I wasnt expecting to address the class. I stumbled through it not the most linear argument to deal with, especially with fragmented annotations to guide my ramblings. I said it succinctly to a classmate in the quad over a cigarette during our break a moment before. But being thrown to the lions unexpectedly derailed my clarity. I did a shoddy job. And when the teacher, as always, asked the rest of the group if they had anything to add to the discussion individually, she remained silent. And afterwards? She apologised profusely, offering at least to do the summation write-up thats required of the speaker from each class session. I blew her off politely, thankfully not demonstratively angry and instead just inaccessibly ok with it, no more to be said. If I was actually weighed down with embarrassment, I would have creamed her. But I let it go as soon as it came on. At least I wont have to present again for the remainder of the session. So like I was saying, I didnt expect to be up for much tonight. Yet Id made tentative plans with Mark tonight to go out for some drinks. He calls me at 7ish to ask me if I still felt up to it, to which I said yes. He mentioned he has to work early in the morning. So I said, good. Id rather do something more early-ish than something late. So he says, Oh, well I was thinking I was going to take a nap and then run these errands. How does meeting me down here in PB at 9:30 sound? Not clear whether I was being dicked around with, I figured I was let off the hook to spend the evening doing homework instead of being expected to go out for inane frivolity. Wed have had a good time, but Im not about to let someone elses convenience thwart my own. Forget it. And as it stands now, Im ahead of the game. Ive saved a few bucks staying in for the night. Im doing my exhausted body a favour. I dont have to drive partially impaired. Ive done all the homework I have due for Monday, amounting to 4 pages of concisely written synthesis and analysis of the readings due today. All this is running through my mind as I head down Manchester towards Encinitas Blvd and my bank. I opted instead to hit 7-11 for some more Mic Ultra and a pack of American Spirits to punctuate my breaks from writing more. Writing to seemingly no one, I know. One of these days soon, Ill realise the dead-end this pursuit really is and abandon it in favour of sculpting a quality novel. But until I desire the structure Ill keep the C drive playing random music, candles lit, sipping beer and smoking cigarettes with stand-up playing on the telly in the background. Wasting time but getting shit done for my A's and staying out of trouble. So instead Ive got a night with Nick Drake. And a few cheep, empty-tasting beers, and a house all to myself with no hour at which I need to think of retiring. My parents actually went out tonight, a Friday at that, together!, to the Acura tennis tournament to see Clijsters win against Lisa Raymond 6-2, 6-2. Kind of ugly, yet they didnt feel the impetus to stay for the doubles match. So I asked why when they came home so soon (me, who ran inside (at 24!!) in the beginning stages of a satisfying cigarette when I heard the pathfinder hit the driveway). They said, So we can go to Julian. Tonight? Yup. They left at 8:30 to drive all the way up there, with my dogs who I was spending my night being entertained by, in the dark to be gone until Sunday. Which settles two things. One, last nights tennis experience was the best night out for my mom and me. And two, Im definitely adopting a greyhound by October. I hate being without a dog. We went out last night to see the singles match between Davenport and some multi-syllabic woman from Eastern Europe. 6-0 the first set, but then the no name came alive and gave Lindsay a run for her money. But then!! Martina Navratilova, 46, and her 18 year-old partner named Svetlana-something against Cara Black and Likotsova. Martina is the /first/ lesbian I ever saw on TV. And the first one I admired, even though most of America despised her because she was positioned against Chrissy Evert. But I got to see her, fresh off her Wimbledon victory positioning her in the realm of Billy Jean King, surpassing her record of titles. And yes, positioning her right next to me on her way onto the court. I didnt get her autograph, but our night was pretty damn memorable. What an athlete. I mean, Im coordinated, and even an exceptionally talented soccer player but shes like if Mia Hamm had an idol SHES A LEGEND!! And there she was standing with me, chumming it up with her partner two feet from me. And Pam Shriver, sitting next to me the first professional tennis match I ever saw was at that court with her, playing Seles. And there was me and my mom and her friend Gail, sitting in the second row along the aisle used for the players to come on and off. It was magic, like seeing ok, like seeing Stephi Graf and Andre Agassi in person, right there on your level. Fantastico. That was easily the best night Ive ever spent out with my mom. No wonder she left early tonight; theres no way tonight could have competed with last nights tennis-loving bliss. Hunger for nourishment supersedes any desires to keep going.

 Should I post an image of a tumbleweed, or should I aim for an auditory touch with chirping crickets? Hm... suddenly getting no hits whatsoever for a couple of days now, nearly discouraging me from all this public writing. It'd be less complicated to write privately. Maybe I'll take another hiatus, this one deliberate.

 Theres something wonderfully positive in the progression of the lives of me and my friends. Amy's in Barbados. Chris is getting married and leaving town. The girls in Minnesota are planning a move. And Bryan... Went over the Bryans new pad in downtown Carlsbad tonight to see the thing and check out the neighbourhood. This cute old house with charm in abundance. Smallish and cosy, I helped him (Albeit with the limitation of a cripple) get his bed put together. Right before leaving for Tom Gibblins for a couple of pints. A quaint waltz around the streets of that cute-ass borough, and I was tuckered out. Well yeah! I spent the day at the tennis tournament! Ok, so I didnt run into any ex-girlfriends, but I did see Kim Frost. Mom even pointed her out as she walked by, urging me to go over and say hi. Mom, of course, doesnt know the crush I have on her. Or that the crush was the reason I kept going back to her for massages last summer before my surgery. Then one day, she went to kiss me goodbye. Only she went for my mouth. Wha?!! Just a friendly peck was intended, I gather. Or rather, I soon found out. I hesitated, gave her that look like, are you kidding? Do you have any idea what Id like to do to you? Yeah, that lead to a somewhat awkward moment. Only it came off as well as it could have. It didnt happen, and the two of us had a good chuckle. As I figured she knew, I let her in on my lustful intentions. And let her know if she ever changed her mind, I was all for the change of heart. God damn, that woman would be a night to write about. So anyway, she was with her nephew and some young woman with him. I suppose she didnt have the space to be uncomfortable even if she was. God bless the shock factor. And god bless that woman's body. (wolf whistle) 40-nothin! Fucktastic. Don't mind if I do. Since I'm being crude and pricking this vein already, i have to ask... Can The Man Show really be hosted by different guys? I dont think so. Jimmy Kimmel and Adam Corola /made/ that show. Thank Comedy Central for rerunning the goodins. Ive decided. Im adopting a greyhound! I love my dawgs. I cant imagine living in that condo without a pooch to share it with. And to save a little athletes life would reign supreme. I want a brown one. Finally, a dog who can outrun red-dog Casey. Getting to cook dinner for my exhausted mom tonight clinched it I /officially/ cant wait until I have a kitchen of my own and can do that every night. Cooking is, second to none, the best thing for creative energies since sex was invented. Just got to find someone to share the place with.

 Did you know?! To get into MENSA, you only need to have an IQ of 130? Yes, thats right kids. Just a copy of your Stanford-Binet testing results saying youre in the top 2% of the population in intelligence testing. Oh, and a $25 non-refundable evaluation fee. And what do you get? Apparently, a lot of nothing. Outside of bragging rights. Which, if you elect for such a thing, will only serve to lose you friends, not win any more of them. Bryan is right; all the people you ever meet who have membership seem to bring it up in conversation pretty early on. And theres nothing to support their merit aside from the egotism youd assume from such a person whod go out of their way to join. Yet what was I researching the other day? Just for fun, I wasted some time at the computer when MSN Today popped up with an invitation to take someones IQ test. I hadnt taken one since I was a freshman in high school, and before then I was in elementary school. So I decided to take it. Mind you, I got every question right, and it still only gave me a 135 score. Yes, I care about these measures of my worth!! Sure, I took a lot of drugs and still do, if you count prescription pain pills and non-addictive sleep aides. Am I a lesser human being for being intrigued still with being a member of said elitist organisation? Theres dating potential, or so they advertise. Id guess thats the only advertisable perk to membership. That, and sharing stimulating conversation with other egomaniacs like yourself. What if the fun-time of dropping acid and snorting Comet robbed me of my twenty-point cushion? What if no queer woman would pander to such an elitist organisation? What if its all a big joke by the people with IQs higher that 175 to milk money from insecure, gullible folks who want confirmation of their brilliance and status. And are willing to pay 25 bucks for a piece of paper and the rights to brag in cocktail conversations when theyre feeling marginalised by their dorkdom? Thats me, yes. Since the original paper is gone that lauded me for my scores, I suppose Ill have to find other means to feel good about myself. Frickin' thing is lost!! Mom has no statement about it, save for her sorry excuse: It used to be in your file in the family records. Guess Im back to shallow measures to establish my credibility. All over again!

 So heres how the day went down. Now that I have some time to reflect on it being at school finally this morning, too late to show up to my first class and interrupt everyone by appearing 15 minutes before were let out. So I got up early enough on Saturday after a rather long session of drinking with Chris Kueffner. Mr. Orange and I went out to dinner in Solana Beach before hitting the Tidewater for some more drinkies and to watch the locals hook up, stinking up the pool tables with drunken play. I think I got home around 10, which was good considering my flair for sleeping too much. Up around 7:30am in time for a long shower and a trip to the neighborhood Starbucks to fuel up for the morning. I headed down to San Diego, getting off the freeway at Washington only to realize 9am wasnt early enough for a decent parking space. On top of the circling around Hillcrest and University Heights neighborhoods, I noticed the temperature gauge on my dashboard alerting me to a higher-than-usual reading. I started to panic as Im wont to do when something is amiss with the car. I treat it like a living being, always with a turning stomach of empathy. So I shut it down at the first sight of a spot, almost in the red but close enough to satisfy me I was running late on top of it, and my hands were shaking pretty badly. Took off running down Florida Street a couple of blocks north of Lincoln, trying to make it to the Living Room as quickly as possible. Running with my back as it is, up hills, across intersections. I got there in time to meet the crew, throw on a school-club t-shirt in a size small (stretching it a bit, I know), and let the sweat dry off before making it back onto the streets. What a crowd! Over 250 groups marched this year. Our spot on the street was #101, so we were back there chumming it up for quite a while after getting ourselves situated. A couple of runs to the nearby 7-11 for spiked lemonades hidden in Super Big Gulp containers. A few jokes exchanged, all eyes awandering to the eye candy passing by us. And then, the parade. I couldnt believe the size of the crowds gathered along that mile stretch of Hillcrest. The procession lead us down University onto 6th Avenue until we made it into the park area where the festival was held. I stood a little behind the leaders at first, a bit shy to let out too many hoots and hollers. But once I got my confidence up, I too began to vocalize my enthusiasm, waving to the crowd of supporters and even taking hold of one side of the banner for about a quarter of the way. A few protesters in their usual spot just west of the 163 bridge. This year about 5 cops on horses stood between the marchers and the hellfire crew. Too bad, cause I had planned to flash the fuckers. Big smiles and taunting laughter shot back at them. I turned to the boyfriend of our website designer, saying, I didnt know my parents were coming!! Laughter is the best antidote to hate. As we turned the corner into the park, I saw an old friend. Kerri Lou, a woman I hadnt seen in six or seven years. Talk about a needle in a haystack! I ran over to her, taking off my sunglasses to help her recognize me. She begged me to exchange information so we could find each other later, but the parade was still in motion. I couldnt stop. Laughing to my schoolmates back in line about the absurdity of actually seeing someone you know amidst such a crowd, she came running up behind me, cell phone in hand, asking for my number. Yeah, I got a few reactions from the gesture wolf whistles from the group at her insistence we see each other later. Whos THAT? And then it was over. We sank down into the grass at the end of the line, took pictures, and shared some well-earned hugs of congratulations for being in our first-ever Pride march representing Cal State San Marcos. The festival was a hoot. Seeing beautiful boys dressed in things Id never attempt myself. Mullets-a-plenty. Leather chaps with naked butts sticking out the back. All sorts of folks. The highlight was getting to dance with Matt and Terence on the main dance floor until the heat had us sweating. A few drinks and a lot more walking. Then I met up with Kerri, met her friends, wandered around the fruit loop of booths collecting samples of lube and stickers, signing petitions, ogling the leather for sale. Time to head home along the two mile trek that lead me that far away from my car, stopping in at the Flame for a glass of water and a pint to cool off. What a charming afternoon. So sore from all the activity, I could hardly walk yesterday. I made it home alright, stopping a couple of times to give my car a break and to pick up dinner and some beer for the early night that was ahead of me. Ran into an old therapist from rehab and her husband and new child. I cant remember her name for the life of me, but Ive run into her enough times before to warrant a hello and a life update from each of us. Innocent woman I dont think I was entirely courteous to her back in the day because of her purity. Nice to do that differently now that Im an adult. A bunch of sleep later and a couple of workouts to get the lingering lactic acid out of my muscles, and Im still sore, still tired. But what a weekend. No, I didnt mention it to my parents although I did record on Tivo the local newscasts to see if theyd have seen me there. Nada. No need to ruin the experience with their boo-hooing. Car in the shop with what seems to be a broken timing belt. Or a water pump problem, or a radiator leak. Something making my car run hot. So Im renting a little chevy piece of crap for the day to keep my life rolling along without major interruption. Best get to the reading for my noon class. And to get a head start on the paper I have due on Wednesday. Tomorrow is the tennis tournament, and I can be sure to be wiped out by the time I get home from that. All this fun is tiring.

 So sore I can hardly walk. Its nap time now that the workout is behind me, the house cleaning is complete, errands have been run. Watching Juventus and Barcelona on tv lulled me into too restful a state to keep awake for much longer. Later homework and some writing after I wake up again. Hm... that's better. five hours long though? I don't know if that's quite a nap as much as going back to sleep. Not that I feel any more awake. I think what I should be doing instead of tinkering around on the computer is get my butt outside and open the hood of my car. Check some fluid levels or something, try to figure out what's up with the overheat problem. So strange... never let on to this being a potential problem until yesterday... machines are a pain.

 I did something bad tonight. No, I didnt kidnap a beautiful maiden and force her to talk dirty to me in an English dialect. But its not yet 10pm, is it. I still have time I took a drive. Partly to get a chance to breathe, and to have a chance to breathe in cancer-stick fumes. But after I was out, I felt I had to have a destination. Then my project that began a couple of days ago came back to me. I need addresses for postcards. And who must I send one to? You guessed it. Ok, so I sent Claudia one from Italy, so this isnt a huge stretch for your imaginations. But Id conveniently forgotten her address so I did a drive-by. The only time I can do this is at night, hopefully when all the family is already home and tucked away inside, away from view of passing traffic. Like me, doing a U-ey in their cul-de-sac. Writing the numbers down a block away in a book I happen to be reading, the only paper I could find, sitting shotgun in my car. I know its a questionable decision to mail her a postcard. Or to even have her mailing address written down. But you know its never over. Should I send one to Sharon, Sally, Torril, Tatiana, Kerri, Julia, Tamara, Anna, etc ok, Anna is one I expect to send one to. But shes thousands of miles away. And therefore safe. Like Claudia will be for the time Im in Barbados. Or was in Italy. See? I plan these things out. Bad, bad girl. Yet this cute bucket hat and pigtails makes me look so so innocent. Ok. Scratch that. All clear. Proceed.

 Anyone interested in sharing a few hours in the middle of the night in an LAX terminal with me? Just spent the better part of my free time today researching the many ways I can get myself up to LAX in time for an early morning flight on the 19th. Who would have thought this would be so expensive? And without the money to make that expense a choice for me, how /difficult/ is it to get there at that time of day? So I called Cloud9 to see what it would cost to take a shared van sort of thing. ma-don! 200/one way!!! I could drive up there and park somewhere for the duration of the trip for a mere 12/day. Something like 120bucks. Or I could stay at a hotel the night before and take a free shuttle over cost varying, nothing I want to waste money on. Ive limited funds. Why not spend it on drinks and prostitutes in Barbados? So I figured it out. Take the TRAIN! I booked a trip from Solana Beach Station at 10:30pm on the 18th, the closest thing to my departure time that they offered. I arrive at Union Station (train station code LAX) at 1:30am. Heres the catch: LAX in train lingo aint the same as LAX international airport. One would ASSUME theres a correlation or at least a connection! between the two. But no. So now what? A quick plug into Mapquest reveals that theres 20 miles of street traffic in between these two destinations. (Mental calculations of cab costs should be ticking away in your heads). No. Again, the shared van option? Yeah, I doubt it. At 2am? So my Dad is two seconds away from paying for a hotel room for me so that Im safe and dont end up wandering around downtown LA in the middle of a night. Like Id let it happen that way!! So Im a good kid, and I hate taking advantage of my dads money/charity. Theres got to be a way to do this safely and affordably, right? Like he and I were saying, Were not the first people to bitch about how hard it seems to get between these two destinations! Et, Voila! The LA Subway! Id completely forgotten about it having never taken it in my life. Shit, Ive only been on a train once, and that was about twenty years ago. It runs into the night, and it takes a good hour and a half. Long enough to break up the monotony of sitting around until 7:40 to fly on out of there to Miami. 3am to 7:20 isnt too terrible. Look, Im going to Barbados. Amys flying me out, bless her heart. And staying with her knocks off a few thousand! for the week. When you do it cheep, you get what you get and you thank the Lord for the pleasure of the experience ~ because its going to be quite a while for you to reflect on it. I cant wait. Tomorrows the 8th. I leave on the well, in reality, the 18th. Oh my. I cant believe this is on the telly right now, but Im watching it with a disgusted sneer, so it relieves me of the horror of being associated with those who set this to record on the tivo. The fucking /reunion/ of 90210. These has-been chumps who gained fame for a crap show ten years ago talking about themselves with the most self-congratulatory tone Ive ever heard. I mean, this show SUCKED. Presenting it like it was this momentous event. It was a crappy soap opera with trite scripts, fantasy-fulfilment story lines, and bad fashion. In their defense, Id rather watch reruns of that crap than all these reality shows. The catch is, Id rather turn off the telly altogether and flip on the puter and listen to some music. Well ok, maybe if one of those reality shows was about lesbians, Id watch it. Although Id still protest, saying its shallow and stereotypical. But I saw ten minutes of Bravos new Boy meets Boy and I was totally intrigued until I turned it off because its not quite the thing I care about. The fact that its gay and I know folks will be talking about it made me stick around for as long as I did. Which MUST be why straight folks watch these fake-marriage game shows. Enough! First, the TV is turned off. Punk-ass arrogant actors talking about their long-past heyday as if they did something important. Bye-bye. Time for a walk through the neighbourhood. Im tanned and tired from the gym. I think a walk is all Im capable of at this point. Someone in the park in front of my house is standing there, letting their phone play music incessantly. All dark beneath the trees cant help but realise Im being watched. Maybe I should take off my clothes and write naked like I do in the mornings. I need a shmoke. Some fresh air to calm my sun-exposed skin. Got a cute new chocolate brown bucket hat today and a green shirt that matches my eyes. Pleased with the purchase. Donning pig-tails tonight. Tattered shorts to match the hats frayed ends. Should be enough cover to go out and skulk around smoking cigarettes. With the rhythmic flip-flopping of the ever-threatening shower shoes us Southern Californians like so much. BEWARE of DUDE.

 A lust for discipline. Its finally time in my day to sit back and entertain myself after the longest, most productive day outside of hyper-mode episodes. Out the door to school by 8:15am, to class at 9am to turn in a paper and receive the lecture, then to the bookstore in Oside during break for a copy of some crap needs to be read by Monday, wolfed down two bagels while speeding back to school on the 78, stopped off at the condo models to get another look at the kitchen space to help conceptualise my own place and what can fit, then drove home for a quick wardrobe change, back to school again for another class, then applied for graduation in the admissions and records office when it was over, over to the new library and did 2 hours of supplemental research for a term paper due next Wednesday, made phone calls on the drive down the 5, stopped by the pharmacy to pick up a prescription for summore drugas, then to the gym for two more hours including an hour on the elliptical where I burned a cool 900 calories (super-hard pace) and did 300 sit-ups and all my weights at 10-20 pounds heavier than usual home by 7pm. Only to begin cleaning on automatic, throwing my stinkies into the wash, and remaking the bed my dogs had made a mess of. At least Ive the sense to know that my body needs a rest, not to do too much more after all that Id accomplished. Maybe its a depression holdover, that feeling that if I slow down or stop, Ill never get those last couple of things and complete them. Why? I have the whole day tomorrow with absolutely nothing planned to do. Silly. Lots on my mind. Got to keep busy, be productive, creative, active. Just ate enough to stifle my exuberance. Ravenous when I get done with those workouts! And in fact, I suddenly feel like lying down and passing out. Its finally catching up with me. Enticed by the possibility of rerunning the strangely troubling but overall quite lovely dreams of last night. But so much happened today that I want to talk about! I have some vomit I wanted to expel over the press conference I witnessed while on the elliptical this afternoon - yes, involving a certain film star. (or should I be putting film in quotes as well?) I guess Ill have to get to that tomorrow, along with anything more I feel like cramming into this already-long day. Larry-fucking-FLINT? OK, OK... enough from me already, or I'll collapse. Tomorrow's BLOG title? "Move over Minnesota..."

 Sooo so, so tired. Ocean swimming, two hours of sunshine, heavy appointment with Nat, 200 sit-ups, 60 on the elliptical, finished a paper, started another cant keep my concentration long enough to write anything about the day other than that. At least Im done with my homework. Means Ill be prepared tomorrow, turn in an A paper, get to sleep in until 8am before I have to roll out of here. Just think: If I go to bed now, I dont have to get up for 12 hours. Tempting, tempting ok, its settled. Ill try this again another day.

 Theres this sweet boy I know from school. His name is Terence. Something about his disposition, his demure grace, the way he dances with so much freedom and sensuality well, hes a really good soul. Of all the new pals Ive met through this group of ours on campus, hes surely the most compelling character. I might not ask him to father my children until I know him better, but the thought did cross my mind. He likes my blog, it seems. I hope he reads this entry soon. You rock, Terence. I hope we can be better friends as time unfolds. I spent the night with Bryan having greasy pizza and cask-conditioned beers at Pizza Port in Solana Beach. After driving him back to his car, I thought Id stop off for a cigarette refill. When I saw who sat outside An older man in a lawn chair stroking his short, peppered beard. And a lump of blankets a few feet in front of him. A dog, large from what I could tell, tucked beneath a pile of blankets. Save for his little rump that stuck out unprotected. Could have been a great dane. I couldnt tell by its toush. But it was touching nonetheless. This big, noble animal tucked in with blankets and sleeping without any fearful reservation. Its hindquarters sticking out trustingly, innocently. And a man not fully able to take care of himself, yet his pet creature lies heavily upon the concrete with enough warmth to feel overly cared for. And with that image I take leave to join my own puppy-love in a bout of sub-lucidity bliss. So sleepy. The pain pills, sleeping pills, and beer must be reaching a sort of critical mass. Time to retire.

 As a supplement to tonight's big blog, I just have to include this editorial written up in the NYTimes. Bon appetite! Butch, Butch Bush! By MAUREEN DOWD WASHINGTON Let's get it straight. The president and the pope aren't riding the new gay wave. "I believe a marriage is between a man and a woman," said President Bush last week. "And I think we ought to codify that one way or the other. And we've got lawyers looking at the best way to do that." Trying to add a tolerant note to an intolerant policy, he allowed that he was "mindful that we're all sinners." Last time I checked, we had separation of church and state, so I don't know why the president is talking about sin, or why he is implying that gays who want to make a permanent commitment in a world full of divorce and loneliness are sinners. If we follow Mr. Bush's logic, shouldn't we have a one-strike-and-you're-out constitutional amendment: no marriage for gays, but no second marriage for straights who prove they're not up to it? The Vatican, always eager to erase lines between church and state, warned Catholic lawmakers it would be "gravely immoral" to vote for gay marriage or gay adoption. Such preaching seems tinny coming after revelations about the scope of homosexuality in the priesthood. Until last week's denunciations, this had been a giddy Summer of Gays. First the Supreme Court blessing. Then Hollywood's raft of gay-themed projects, from J.Lo's lesbian turn in "Gigli" to the Bravo reality shows "Boy Meets Boy" and "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy." "Queer Eye," the summer makeover hit, on the cover of Entertainment Weekly, features five gay guys who swoop in to give the Cinderfella treatment to unexfoliated straight guys, while scattering catty comments about their grooming and decor, such as, "This place screams women's correctional facility." Maybe we should pity President Bush, stranded in his 50's world of hypermasculinity as his country goes gay and metrosexual (straight men with femme tastes like facials). Even the uptight Wal-Mart stores have expanded antidiscrimination policy to protect gay employees, and Bride's magazine is offering its first feature on same-sex weddings. Maybe the president and his swaggering circle should think about a "Queer Eye" makeover. I asked a gay political reporter friend if he could offer some tips: On the vice president: "I'd love to see Cheney with a pierced ear and a diamond stud. Or in a body-hugging black T-shirt, just for the pure sport of it. "He needs new eyewear. With his big face and lantern jaw, he should lose those five-pound glasses. There are some fabulous frames out there. "About his hair, all I can offer is my sincere regrets." On the defense secretary: "In his own sort of antediluvian way, Rummy is a metrosexual. He works. He may be a warmonger, he may be intemperate, but just about every third woman I know wants him." When it came to the president's possibilities, he got really excited: "Cowboy boots are fine for a certain kind of saucy backyard barbecue. But wearing them as often as he does, with those big belt buckles in the shape of Texas, it seems like he's trying too hard to prove his masculinity. "He's definitely on the right track with low-stress weight lifting, but if he really wants a physique for the ages, a little yoga would help uncoil that gunslinger hunch. "His hair is too tightly clipped. It looks painted on. And he's a huge squinter. The corner of his eyes are starting to look lined. Botox alert! "He needs to dip into the merciful world of cosmetic products and avail himself of some kind of lip balm or gloss that helps mask the fact that he misplaced his lips somewhere. "In open-collar shirts, he has a tiny little island of lost chest hair. It is too low to be a shaving oversight and too high to be a peripheral outgrowth of Alec Baldwin chest mat. It's neither fish nor fowl, so he should wax it out of there. "Everything else about him just shouts `Butch, butch, butch!' But to throw Bush a metrosexual bone, whenever you see him walking off Air Force One with that little furball Barney under his arm, that canine puff of air that most drag queens wouldn't be caught dead with, it's like he's halfway to a Chanel rabbit fur handbag. "Bush does such a good job of seeming blissfully laid back and vacantly bubbly that he might as well go blond. It might help with California's electoral votes, too."

 Damn it, the new Jane's Addiction song is bueno. Hold on whilst I burn it onto a CD. Taking a little break from the paper writing session I launched into this afternoon as a relief from the excessive sun exposure and the heavy conscience resulting from a late night of drinking and smoking with friends that lasted into the morning. The temperature was right to get a lot of difficult writing worked through without much effort. Its so gratifying to nail down complex material, grafting quotes into the paper like they were born there. T.S. Eliot and Friedrich Nietzsche and the elimination of the self in the artists renderings. Pretty difficult reading, some of that stuff. But the paper came off like witchcraft. Brilliant. So I took a break finally to take a drive down to Trader Joes to see Bryan at work. Ended up bagging for him at the register, feeling alternately a stranger there and incredibly comfortable slipped back into that role. Bagging is fun, kind of an addictive challenge like a marathon of Tetris. Some kind of talent that I seem to have taken to. I wonder if customers even notice the genius when they unpack their groceries. Maybe calling it genius is a bit hyperbolic. Signed a petition outside the store as I left, feeling a touch grounded to my community for being a registered voter with the power of the pen in hand. I signed one for wetlands preservation, but the other two I had to decline. So discerning! This voter can read the petition and make a decision! Its a kick in the pants sometimes to exercise a highly opinionated disposition through healthy outlets. Came time this afternoon to do my reading for my literary commentary class. I went first for the piece Id read once already Against Interpretation by Sontag. Read it a couple of years ago, but without the context of the history of critical theorists, it didnt make as much sense as this time. And I have to say that it has reconstructed my whole take on the subject of critiquing art. If youll permit me to explicate just a bit I need to throw these points out. Dont know if Im in the mind state to really discuss it. Well see. Maybe tomorrow. Just for a teaser, Ill say it has functioned to call into question (again) the purpose/value of therapy and those interpretations. Once upon a time (say, for Dante), it must have been a revolutionary and creative move to design works of art so that they might be experienced on several levels. Now it is not. It reinforces the principle of redundancy that is the principle affliction of modern life. But I think for that to have its due impact, I need to backtrack a bit 1: Interpretation first appears in the culture of late classical antiquity, when the power and credibility of myth had been broken by the realistic view of the world introduced by scientific enlightenment (3). 2. Interpretation thus presupposes a discrepancy between the clear meaning of the text and the demands of (later) readers. It seeks to resolve that discrepancy The interpreter, without actually erasing or rewriting the text, is altering it He claims to be only making it intelligible, by disclosing its true meaning (3). 3. The old style of interpretation was insistent, but respectful; it erected another meaning on top of the literal one. The modern style of interpretation excavates, and as it excavates, destroys; it digs behind the text, to find a sub-text which is the true one (3). 4. interpretation is the revenge of the intellect upon art. And further: By reducing the work of art to its content and then interpreting that, one tames the work of art. Interpretation makes art manageable, comfortable (4-5). An aside: D.H. Lawrence said, Never trust the teller, trust the tale. You like my enumerations? 5. It is always the case that the interpretation of this type indicates a dissatisfaction (conscious or unconscious) with the work, a wish to replace it by something else (6). Huh? HUH? Are you following me here? You should read the piece. Its rather short, succinct. To consolidate the argument for her 6. the mark of something good? Suppose its when the beauty and sophistication of the images subvert before the our eyes the callow pseudo-intellectuality of the story I could insert some more about form vs. content, but I dont want to ruin the climax of exegesis. To continue 7. T ransparence is the highest, most liberating value in artand in criticismtoday. Transparence means experiencing the luminousness of the thing in itself, of things being what they are (9). 8. see the quote above or let me just repeat myself: Once upon a time (say, for Dante), it must have been a revolutionary and creative move to design works of art so that they might be experienced on several levels. Now it is not. It reinforces the principle of redundancy that is the principle affliction of modern life (9). 9. Interpretation takes the sensory experience of the work of art for granted, and proceeds from there. This cannot be taken for granted (9). And finally, #10: Ill consolidate these bits. What we decidedly do not need now is further to assimilate Art into Thought, or (more yet) Art into Culture. Interpretation takes the sensory experience of the work of art for granted, and proceeds from there. This cannot be taken for granted Ours is a culture based on excess, on overproduction; the result is a steady loss of sharpness in our sensory experience (9). Our task is to cut back content so that we can see the thing at all (9). The clincher: "Our task is not to find the maximum amount of content in a work of art, much less to squeeze more content in a work than is already there. Our task is to cut back content so that we can see the thing at all. The aim of all commentary on art now should be to make works of artand by analogy, our own experiencemore, rather than less, real to us. The function of criticism should be to show how it is what it is , even that it is what it is , rather than to show what it means . In place of hermeneutics we need an erotics of art (9-10). So, shut up Hamlet. Value the reality and stop thinking so much about it, trying to string together fragments of logic that cheapens the power of the moment. The experience. Yeah. Ill site this essay on the defence stand sometime in the future.

 Leave it to my education to spark new life into my love of literature. Lucky me, the book list for the upcoming term was released early, meaning yesterday instead of the 18th, the day I would be leaving for my trip. So I sucked up my anxious, hypersensitive depression and drove on out to B&N for a look-see in their stacks. I dont always expect these titles to be carried by a commercial bookstore. But I found a good amount, enough to pack my bags full of preparatory reading, well enjoyed under the warmth of tropical skies. I began one this afternoon. Had a mind to just read the first chapter to get a sense of it, then check out a new one. 50+ pages later, and I realised I was in for the long haul. What a treat! Its Nice Work by David Lodge. Think England in the late 1980s. Economic uncertainty, Margaret Thatchers Reagan-like castration of the university/arts budgets, capitalism vs. holdover idealism of the 60s and 70s. University literature teacher meets shrewd industrial management. Deftly observant prose, laden with White Noise -esque cultural critiques. I think so far Ill call it TC Boyles Tortilla Curtain with an English perspective mixed with a lighter shade of Delillos White Noise . Im loving it. So three hours of heat-of-the-day sun, and Im just now realising I should save some of this goodness for my trip. Not that I dont have plenty more reading to get through. Although not the entirety of my assigned texts, I picked up the following: Beowulf Heaneys new translation with the original old English Epic of Gilgamesh Homers Iliad Miltons Paradise Lost and other works Tony Morrisons Paradise (scratched out the part of the cover proclaiming its involvement with Opera) And Virgils Aeneid Still to come involve some anthologies, Norton and Heath. And some Dante, the Song of Roland (I thought I still had whered it go? I read it!!), and a science text book sure to cost $75 or so. Im so enamoured with my stacks. The best part about moving into my new place? Its the purchase of new bookshelves at IKEA that stand to hold the sum total of all that Ive acquired as a literature major. I love them. Filling up every spare spot in my room right now, spines triggering memories, the breadth of knowledge staggering. Id like to think Ive accumulated quite a collection. On to things less distracting. Today was creepy, save for the reading time in the sun outside of reality. Decided to crack the beers early to accompany my flight out of here. I had an appointment with the meds doctor this morning. He was late, like 30 minutes, in getting to me. All these asinine statements followed by, do you understand what I mean? over and over again. I was irritated with a lot more than he was addressing before I got there. But his insistence that I wasnt smart enough to follow him was aggravating. Shit, the guy didnt even know that I stopped taking Zoloft a month ago. Or that Ive been taking those sleeping pills for three months now. Such a waste of time, I feel. You get what you pay for, I suppose. Whatever happens with my employment future, I pray I have better insurance. I drove home as unsettled as I felt when Id arrived. A mixed bag of deep sadness and anxiety, combining into a force of manic tendencies. I didnt know if my body wanted to scream or sob, so I tried both. Then hit the beer to settle the matter. Looks like Im destined to commit a few crimes tonight before I go. Not to worry though; Venezuela is just a short swim away from Barbados, and of course they have no extradition treaty with the United States. Im rekindling an old, old friendship with my ex-best pal, Kegs. Call me stupid, but Ive been craving a little marijuana high all week, and I know well be able to achieve a mindless synergy with each other.

 If only we had a school bell to sound to mark the moment. Its done, and I got a couple of As to boot. I suppose I should feel a rush of release, but instead Im still heavy-headed. Ill give it a good shrug, but thats about it. I packed today. Did the laundry for the clean boardshorts and bikinis. Im all ready to roll, save for the purchasing of some colour film and one more beauty product for Amy. Im loading one suitcase, one backpack a miraculous feat of minimalism. Only five pairs of shoes. Or maybe six. Im making Amy a CD. Got sidetracked though with a tune from the Sigur Ros white album that Jen and Dana gave me. Soooo incredibly heavy, so sad I could crawl into bed and be haunted by it all day. Makes me think of my plane flights to and from London, flying far above Iceland in the early morning. Its so mournful, it makes me want to visit Iceland to see what drove them to create such beautiful music. I cant decide which track to choose. I suppose I have more brooding to do. And some more CDs to burn for my trip, strapped to BOSE headphones for the journey.

 Big bad night last night. Awful day today dredging up the muck thats accumulated undisturbed for what seems like centuries. Barely survived social interactions today, although it ended well with the seeing off of Chris K as he leaves the state tomorrow for good. At least I wasnt thinking about suicide hotlines for a couple of hours. Bad day I tell you. But not nearly as scary as last night. A miracle maybe that nothing tragic happened aside from the intake of various adult beverages and a nightmare writing session of things possibly best kept to myself. Back to the beverages again tonight to break up my spell of sadness. I cried on the way to bed last night. Cried when I woke up. Through my coffee, through my shower most of all. Then a little bit more on the way to and from school where I had to get up the courage to speak to my class about the research/literary analysis paper I had to submit. Puked in the john, from nerves, alcohol, and too much coffee and no food. And the heat. Laying supine on the cement in the middle of school in boardshorts and a bikini top, wishing I was happier. Home to feign the emotions of a successful day before escaping to a poolside sojourn where I tried to tune out. All these shrieking kids and loud, mundane discussions between their mothers ranging from a 20 minute dissertation on how many things contain peanuts, a food little Madison cant eat, to the book club reading of fucking Seabiscuit. I got up to grab some tp to jam in my ears to block it out, but it didnt help. Finally giving up, I headed home for a failed attempt at a nap. Too hot and humid, and too much on my mind to let me crash. It's the big C on my mind far too much. Allowed myself to reel into nostalgia of the good times where I could have sworn I was in love and on top of the world. Rereading the letters she sent me last night was about the worst thing I could have done to myself. I had some pretty scary thoughts to accompany such a self-destructive manoeuvre. Sliding to places I havent gone before. Luckily I got on the phone with Jennifer in Minnesota. Thank fucking god she called me back. I tried to leave an innocuous message. One, cause she doesnt answer her phone much like my aunt. A professional screener. And two, I didnt want the girls coming home to a tragic message. Its just not cool if you can help it. We spent, what, an hour on the phone together? Long enough to make me feel human again. And loved. Which is the problem, Im sure. God, I love her. I need those two closer to me. So not fair that we need each other and were so separated. She reminded me to eat something already. And I tried, I truly did. But the last days have killed my appetite. Its not that Im not hungry or dizzy or weak its that my body, my mouth just rejects food. I feel like I have a mouthful of dry crackers that I could just let fall out of my craw as Im chewing. Bleaaah. Take it away. And finally monsieur, a wafer-thin mint? Sleep is on the horizon, I'm sure. Shared a beer with Dads dog. Time to crash and hope for a better tomorrow.

 Can I give another shot out to my pal, James Lileks? One day I'll pay him the tribute he deserves. Maybe in the form of another interpretive dance. It sounded like such a good idea to camp out in the bowels of a minivan with a laptop and write like madness incarnate in the dark. Yet my vision couldnt stand it, and instead my little retreat into some perverse suburban hell turned into an acutely focused headache behind my eyes. And apparently, my laptop isnt thrilled either. What I managed to hammer out is staring me in the face, unable to transfer it to my desktop because my A:/ isnt working. Machines and me just arent jiving today. Ok, lately. A long day of being wildly angry for hours wore me out. Im too exhausted to rehash the blow-by-blow. Let it be sufficient to say that my car is minus a radiator at this hour, and the getting it over to the dealership in Oceanside took a smooth five hours of my day. Not a happy girl, but I never snapped, not even in the privacy of my living room after another aggravating and fruitless phone call. A brief scream was all I indulged in. And why, look at me, model-citizen Mom driving around in a monstrous Chevy something-or-other. The perfect picture of sublimated rage. Comedy Central is running The Ref , an old gem of sardonic wit and cynical screaming about how life fucks you. I love Judy Davis. Who can forget her entrance into Woody Allens flat in the opening scenes of Deconstructing Harry ? Ah, a picture of domestic harmony, this film. Nothing like a hostage situation to bring it all out into the open. Sadly, the flick seems to have been looked over in terms of box office returns. I suppose like most great comedies, its relegated to cult status, appreciated by a few but lost on the bulk of the public. Speaking of the public, I hate people. Have I said that yet today? Seems I always say that. Only it never seems to make the stupid people disappear. Wont /someone/ finally realise theyre a waste of space and just step off that cliff ledge? Why more folks dont open fire on deserving a-holes is beyond me. Of course theres a small contingent out there WHO DOESNT BELIEVE I SAY THIS IS JEST. So Ill state the obvious: No, I wont kill anyone this week . Not only did I run out of energy today digesting my own stomach with too much caustic anger and resultant acids. I forgot to eat again. I know, that sounds ridiculous, but I do it kind of a lot. I had a bagel with tomato at 9am. Then all the anger occupied my brain. I went to the gym at 3pm to boil off the adrenaline. Came home, did some shit, went out to the library at five. I started to get dizzy and wasnt reading with the same retention capacity. So it dawns on me; Im starving!! Hyperbole aside, I thought Id stored up enough food drinking Gatorade and biting my nails. Who knew? At least I capped off a big chunk of homework tonight. 8ish pages of I-can't-believe-this-is-academic blather detailing the agency of women in early American literature. Yet the research was invigorating. Lovely hours spent at the library over the past week. Man, thats a good place to spend some time. Not the schools library. Its shamefully sparse. Not til the new library opens in Fall will I go to school for this stuff. I like the La Costa library. Brand new, empty Youll find me in the reference section. So much exclusivity tucked in among the stacks, the books youre not allowed to take with you. Something so concrete and stable about these things. And the quiet. And the knowing too that no one but a dork will stumble upon my little makeshift hovel of a book nook. I love that I can learn about /anything/ I want. Connect with reliable sources. Even if I think theyre full of shit. The judgement is just waiting there for me to make, strangling writers with the tentacles of my layman brain if theres resistance to easy ingestion. I dunno I have octopuses on the brain tonight for some reason. And yes, thats correct to use that plural derivation. Because vernacular is bueno. And people ignore other plurals all the time and I dont clobber them with their stupidity. Just to myself. Ever hear someone say data in the singular? Its datum, true. But who says that without coupling the expression with a deflective gesture that says, Please dont break my glasses! I think Ive had enough. Ranting, rambling, mentally masturbating on the computer all bases covered. Got to prep my head for another big day tomorrow. Maybe buy some more beer to make it interesting.

 Im the living embodiment of a Jimmy Buffet song. Long day at the racetrack, betting little and drinking plenty. Sitting in the sun in a bikini top and shorts, flip-flops cast aside, floppy bucket hat and shades to keep me from melting. None of my horses came in, but since I didnt bet more than 15 bucks all day, it didnt matter. Luis got really quiet by the end of the day, uncharacteristic of that Nicaraguan party machine. He usually keeps up with me, or more often, surpasses me in stamina. Then again, I havent been going out as much as he has. So I had a blowout. Kind of stumbled on me ould adidas sliders Ive had since high school, and the front half broke off. I left them in an abandoned shopping cart and went on barefoot from there. Luckily I had a spare pair in the car The car that also broke yesterday. Yep, Im looking out the window to see an empty parking spot once again. Thankfully it didnt decide to erupt in a fountain of radiator fluid until I was about to park it at the Kueffners house in Carmel Valley. It would have been quite a bit more angering had it happened whilst hauling ass down the 5. I see steam venting up through the side of the hood of my car as Im awaiting the freeing up of a coveted front row parking space. Not good. The steam shoots up, the girl in the departing car signals for me to roll my window down. You know, all the fluid in your car just - fell out. And indeed it did. Radioactive-looking green fluid bathing the cement. Oops. Guess some JACKASS at the Nissan dealership improperly replaced the radiator hose that I had repaired. So I call the dealership and read them the riot act. To an answering machine, mind you. No ones open. No way to get my car fixed until Monday. Its Saturday night; things like this arent supposed to happen until business hours. So Im without a car again. Which is alright, save for the fact that I took yesterday off from the gym, and now I have to miss going today too. At least the weather is spectacular and I can get more tan-time without the guilt of having somewhere else to be, something else more pressing to engage in. I hesitate to turn on the telly. Its about time for Meet the Press, something I usually watch, but for now I think Ill steer clear of any panel discussions that could venture into the topic of the California gubernatorial race. All this time, I had a mild sense of feeling superior to poor Minnesota for having a damned WWF wrestler for a governor. But now, what do we have? A midget (Gary Coleman), Arnold of Terminator fame, a sobbing Darryl Issa two one-trick ponies for the circus, the other guy the only qualified replacement- pulling out with a hard-to-watch show of emotion. And all these other clowns sending in their 3500 bucks to get their names on the ballot?! I expect to receive some flowers pretty soon, sent by the good people of Minnesota offering their condolences. Now I too hang my head in shame, not wishing to have anything to do with the system thats supposed to reflect and represent me and my fellow statesmen. The whole thing is awash in controversy. The very idea that Grey Davis is attempting to get his own name on the re-election ballot! Trying to delay the vote Davis is going to have to be knocked down a peg hes the most friendless politician I can think of. Except for those among the handful who hes done personal favours for. But who to replace him? Cant a serious contender get into the ring, PLEASE?

 off to barbados then. i'll try to blog from there, but no guartantees. bye! be back the night of the 28th!

 Anyone out there watch sex and the city as religiously as I do? Ok, good. Ive got a bitch. I just sat down to catch up on my shows that my mom faithfully preserved on Tivo while I was gone, and I got to sex . The end scene pissed me off. Actually, the whole thing that was gay themed. Stanfords boyfriend well, of COURSE hes dating an ex-escort. All those gays are so loose and immoral! How lame was that? What was more lame? Um do drag queens date each other?!! Dance with each other? Are all gay men drag queens and/or effeminate? Hel-ooo!!?? (voice of the queen that Charlottes friends with on the show) And then theres the rerun of Sopranos that I watched. The one where Ralphie kills the stripper he got pregnant. And Noah dumps Meadow. Crappy men episode. What gives? I did save one morsel of wisdom from what I saw; Ill never be a pole dancer with my back. Speaking of which, I got a warning today. Seems someone else whos settling with the Joe is telling me that I can expect NOT a lump sum but a bimonthly payment of 300 until its satisfied. And all she got is 25g. and she thinks shell be getting more than me because she has worked there longer. Not sure how much stock I put in it, but when I look at my financial situation, Im not put at ease. Now what?! Ive got a court date in two weeks I keep remembering the troubled sleep I had last night. Dreamt I was in a filmed play of Mamets. Strange scenes of hiding and skirting the law. Prostitution for money and shady business deals. No wonder I woke up wet with sweat. It was so complicated too Im kind of amazed that it was so coherent. Should I write it down? Where do these things come from? Anyway, I woke up with that Im-about-to-get-really-sick feeling. When Id do something, my heartbeat would resonate in a feeling akin to being dizzy or about to faint. Spaced out, weak, and wondering if I was facing a hard time pulling it together to do anything this weekend. I had a friends birthday party to attend earlier on this afternoon, the same group who stood me up a few months ago. I give a shit about this girl, so I made my way out and brought her a cool CD gift. Then theres Bryan. He wanted to get together. Just in case, I went by his work earlier to give him the Cuban cigar I bought for him in Barbados. (theyre still so expensive!!) I like the good gestures, but its hard to be all the way there. But I am feeling better. About a half a gallon of water at lunch and a third of the food I ordered, and I got my strength back. Gulping down pills of Imnell and Echinacea. Ok, ok I need to eat summore and go play with Bryan. Itll give me an excuse to wear jeans again I missed them so on my trip!

 A long, long day of driving. I just got home, taxiing a sleepy Bryan all the way home from a wonderful day at the Getty. We stopped for Chinese before heading home, something I should have known would result in the sleep-deprived boys naptime. That wasnt the plan. The plan was to have Moroccan food in Beverly Hills at 6pm. But when we got there, the door was locked and the open sign turned off. Yes, we even had reservations; I called last night to make them, and everything sounded ok. Strange Ive never gone to a recommended restaurant before (or any restaurant at all) to find it mysteriously closed on a Friday night. But the day. The day was amazing. He slept all the way up there, giving me some time to drive in silence. Speeding along in the carpool lanes, I made it up there in an hour and forty-five minutes. Pretty good for 110 miles into LA on a weekend. The sky was brilliantly clear, the temperature hovering in the 80s. Blue sky setting off the glaring white stone of the architecture. And a unexpected exhibit of Diane Arbus. What a hoot! I held back not to laugh out loud at some of her work. Intentionally humorous, of course. Witty chick. Im far too tired to keep at this tonight. Three pain pills today. Two in the last couple of hours. Seeing freeway lanes when I shut my eyes. Time to check out.

 Its still so weird to see all the hits I get on this thing. All these random google searches of everything from naked gardener to darryl issa retreat. What in the summary makes them click on my site?! Whos looking for this kind of information?! Long, long day. Up at six from the couch downstairs. Yes, somehow in the middle of the night I crept from my room to the downstairs living room with all my bedding and a pillow to sleep somewhere I dont think Ive ever slept before. Not because the dog peed in my bed as usual (I cant believe thats an as usual statement). I really cant remember doing it at all. Just that my back has been one horrendous mess the past couple of days with the stress of travel, school starting, and the added burden of carrying around multiple literature anthologies to and from bookstores and classes. I must have had it on my waterbed last night and opted instead for a firmer (still made of feathers) place to crash out. But not to remember I must have taken a sleeyep, thats what happened. I took one of my sleeping pills. So I left the house by 7am for an 8:30 class. Stayed on until 11, went to coffee with Andrea, back to school from 1-2:15, then back home to eat (I cant afford even a burrito right now), then hit the traffic mess that is the late day commute out to San Marcos for a 5:30-8:15 class. My classes challenging and fun. My teachers one Ive had before and adore, another I cant decide on quite yet, and a third (for two classes) is troublingly adorable. Its going to be one hell of a mental workout this term. Speaking of which, I capped off the day with a little US Open at the YMCA while pumping away on the elliptical. I didnt get home until just before 10pm, and boy is my back upset with me. a dinner of a beer and a tiny sampling of the 1986 Warres porto I bought for my mom on the island. Im sure the dogs would appreciate it if I opened the fridge again tonight. Forever hopeful globs of drool gathering on the tile. And really, I should eat more than a nectarine for dinner. And a peanut butter sandwich for breakfast/lunch. Nothing compared to the fanciful feast we indulged in at 808, the restaurant in La Jolla. That was Sunday with the family. Starting out the meal as usual with a perusing of the wine list, a decision left to me lately. I chose a St. Suprey cabernet, something dry-ish to let the delicate flavour of the fish come through. Im amazingly talented in every area of fine living, I know. I couldnt pass up the offering of a Deconstruction Roll for an appetiser. Having recently finished a literary theory course, I couldnt help but imagine Derrida let loose in a kitchen of a trendy restaurant. Well, isnt cuisine art? The langoustine risotto was simple but inspired. The ono was delicate and matched well with the sauce (cant remember what it involved besides a mild coconut curry). A good restaurant. Maybe not as good as the place next door, Caf Japengo, but Ill take either one if I dont have to cover the $200 bill for 4. Thanks again, Dad. Ive got my eye on both for the big 25 birthday dinner next week. Time to shut off this shit receptacle and spend some time planning my trip to the Getty this weekend. For the Flemish Illumination exhibit and the medieval books. Maybe try to work in some thai food and a sloppy diner into the agenda for the day. She-it. Im a dork.

 What a waste of time. Why I got up this morning is beyond me. I thought Id wake up early. This, my last day of summer. The YMCA was only going to be open for two hours today, so I got there when they opened to make sure I got on a machine I like. Stupid people posted at the door charging five bucks to get in! To ensure we do this again next year on a holiday. Sounds pretty pathetic, but I dont have five bucks. The travel difficulties wiped out my checking account (and then some). Im up and dressed and hopped up on pain killers so I can work hard, and I have to turn around and drive home. I wish I wasnt so angry so I could go back to sleep. Tension making my muscles spasm more than usual. I wish I could go for a run and hammer out my frustration on the pavement, but knowing what thatll do to my back convinces me to just sit here and eat it. Stored fuel for later eruptions of overwhelmed helplessness. My hormones are on high today; this is not the way to start out the day. I dont suppose most people let something this small upset them. Its all a too-delicate balance for me. No reserves of strength to dip into. Guess I might as well eat breakfast and shower and pretend that didnt happen. When I own my own house, Ill build a special wall just for me to put my fist through when I want. Buy separate glassware and a backstop to hurl it at. And probably hurt my back throwing a tantrum. Cant I even act out without it worsening my lack of faculty?

 Oh, what can be said that hasnt been addressed already? Another listless day of cleaning and slinking around the house without a shower. Feels like life is on hold until I can figure out how better to engage in it. Playing around on the computer, noticing the view outside to a beautiful day, and Im making no move to go out and enjoy it. cell phone remains silent. Email accounts vacant. The only connections I feel like making these days. A wedding takes place this afternoon in Carlsbad, but Im definitely not up to it. I think Id rather stay close to home in case I decide to go back to sleep. Maybe a shower will help propel me to do something with the day. I know Id skipped it yesterday best not to let things slide too far when I can help it.

 Been screwing around with PhotoShop today to create a character prototype for my LTWR 310 class. Group work, but I've taken the reigns. We're rewriting the Epic of Gilgamesh into a homoerotic tale starring Keanu Reeves as Enkidu and Gale Harold (from Queer as Folk) as Gilgamesh. Here's what I did today:

 People are such IDIOTS! Just depressed. Thinking dark thoughts, simple things about others drawing me in with remorse for our sorry state as a species. Wanting to see past the mundane implications of our behavior to see us as a more elevated conglomerate of significant individuals. Looking around me at school, I see people, hear them speak to each other, and my heart sinks with despair. I cant hold it, and I cant let it go. Shallow and meaningless, all of it. I awoke in the middle of the night in a bed I didnt go to sleep in. Another episode, two this week, of me getting up and moving places to sleep without remembering it. Is it sleepwalking? I suppose so. Kind of unsettling to not be in control of myself while Im asleep. Maybe I should lock myself in my room somehow. Am I moving to help my back, or is there something else thats so upsetting to me that Im trying to escape even while Im asleep? Did I have another nightmare that I cant remember? What happens when I live alone, have no one there to notice that the front door was opened in the middle of the night for a sleepwalker to make her way out into the street? Worse than that, the dog followed me into the room and peed on the bed. The bed with the comforter I dont know if I can wash. I didnt have time this morning to augment the situation. Just enough time to get out the door and make it to school in time for a decent parking spot. What do I say to my mom? Do I have to take those sleeping pills to keep me deeply asleep so that doesnt happen? Why do I feel guilty for whats happening to me? Went into the bathroom once I got here, sat down on one of the toilet seats and muffled some tears welling up inside of me. I could hide out alone and let it out if only I had a safe place to do that. A place to go where no one would follow me or be a witness to it. Im trapped in autopilot until I can construct that space.

 not feeling it today. aching body, heavy heart. glad to have school to distract me. maybe i'll get into it more later on today...

 Revisiting the town of iniquity tonight. The scene of my last moral/ethical debacle. Carlsbad, the place where Bryan lives and a part of me jumped head-long into the raging river below. Only a couple of souls know what that means. For them, you get the eerie significance. Bryan had a little thing at his house tonight. A nice night of making various California pizzas from scratch, drinking beer and wine, and listening to good music. I walked off with a CD copy of one of my all-time favs, Ray Charles. The entertainment broke up, and we went to a DVD of Amelie. Still mourning the loss of that one in my collection, but glad that my girls in Minnesota are enjoying it. I have to be up early for class tomorrow. Two classes of Hayton, then a fun one with Martha Stoddard-Holmes, followed up by a later course with a new teacher I dont know yet. The reading list for her is 90% things Ive read in the last two years. The Hayton material is all I worry about. Shes the one Im afraid of impressing. i could hardly speak to her the other day. i've feared this pairing for the entire time i've been enrolled in this university. knew i'd cower under her authority, so i dropped a class with her a couple of years ago. guess i can't avoid her anymore. i hope i don't fuck this up too.

 and... "The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom." I can't decide whether these quotes from Blake are genius or just plain indulgent.

 Poked, prodded, made to bend and hold my position under the eye of the X-ray machine I spent two long, irritating hours at a doctors office this morning, missing my first class and all but fifteen minutes of the second. Stupid supplementary appointment to appease the defense lawyers in my lawsuit they always want a second opinion. I was the perfect [im]patient, just sitting there reading while sighing heavily as the time ticked by. 8 more X-rays. Yep, count em. I did. All of them since my injury, I counted over twenty five of the suckers. All without a lead apron. All showing relatively the same thing; either pre or post-implants. Nothings changed, and yet each doctor wants his own sets of pictures. I have to say I was filled with a little anxious excitement about coming to school today. I bought a book at the Getty bookstore for my professor, Heather. I made it to her class right at the end, in time to turn in my homework and hand it to her. My hands were shaking, and I could tell I would have a hard time speaking with much relaxed ease. But I did it, waited until everyone had left from our class, and I handed her the bag with the book in it. Turns out shed bought one already. I let her know first and foremost that it was only four bucks, so I couldnt resist getting one for her as well as myself. She spent forty! She decided to donate it to the library even though I thought it would still be cool for her to save it and give it to someone whod appreciate it. A moment of ass-kissing, talking about the exhibit. At least, I didnt want it to seem like ass-kissing. Im too afraid of her to offer that much up on the first chance I have to talk to her. My voice was fast and deep, sounding a little rough from a cold or something. Im not comfortable with those first couple of meetings with a teacher who carries such a reputation. For being tough, smart, and very cool. I suppose I was worried Id come across as intimidated as I am. Yesterdays bout with depression has spilled over into today. I feel a weight pulling at my chest, something tethered to my tear ducts. Feelings of loss for missing class, for the coming days, for the squandering of time I perceive to be taking place all over the map. My body being broken, my finances not in my control, the living situation I still wait for. Making and keeping appointments feels like a drain on my psyche, yet not having anything to do is even more terrifying. What softens the burden is the homework and reading I have in front of me, alluring in its capacity to take me away from paralyzing ennui. I know that when its all over, Ill sink back into the blues like I did in May. But thats not for months in the future; I can manage until then and reevaluate how to escape it then. Another 45 minutes until my next class. What Id really like is a gym on campus. Or at least within a few miles. I took a walk, took a pain pill, and ate a bit of veggies for lunch to try to boost my spirits. You know, all this writing is well and good, but I need to be producing something. Something viable in the marketplace. Something I can point to for career potential. What am I going to do when school is over? urlLink ickykitty

 In case you all are wondering what Ive done to deserve having my parents buy a condo for me to live in exhibit A: Mom made dinner, and as Sunday would have it, we watched Sopranos while we ate. Now, I try to be a good kid, not only cleaning up the house before they come home from Julian at the end of each weekend, but I also like to let my mom take it easy somewhat. And since she cant relinquish any of the actual cooking duties to me (its her favourite thing to do each day), I like to do the dishes for her. So since it involved the disposal of chicken bones, something to be taken outside away from the reach of the nosey dogs, I went to gather the plates. Each of us had finished what we were served. I grabbed my plate, my moms, then asked my dad if he was done. He said no, so I cleaned the two I had plus all the rest of the preparatory dishes. Came around again and mentioned there was still some leftovers, asking if I should wrap it for dads lunch tomorrow. Sounded like I should, so again I asked my dad if I could take his plate, the last item before firing up the dishwasher and ajax-ing the white sink to sanitary purity. He tried to take it himself, but I was already soapy. And I was in the help-mom zone. When I get going, why not finish the job? Its what my dads been yelling at me for since I was a kid. So I take the plate, take out the trash, start the dishwasher, bleach the sink, clean the stovetop, soak and scrub the pans all the while missing the Sopranos while mom and dad relax. And then I hear, Well, she asked you if you were finished! Well, she insisted in taking my plate! he says. So get up and make another plate. I told you there were extras. Ill pause the Tivo. I didnt hear the rest; just enough to put me on that verge between wanting to get angry and throw a silent tantrum and feeling like confronting/resolving the problem directly to expose the weak link in the communication process. I thought about finishing the chores and slinking upstairs silently. Then I realised: Just put the rest of the food on a plate, bring it to him, and tell him straight that he told me he was done, and all I was aiming to do was to help mom from having to do the dishes. All you had to do is say you were having seconds. Mom and I had a brief, private laugh about him on my way upstairs. I was leaving the kitchen through one door while he was coming in through another entrance to refill his wine glass. That just the way it is, she says. I know, I respond casually. I could have been pissed at him or I could just give him what he wants and let it go. Whatever. At least he didnt yell at me. I always love that; being a trooper, a model citizen, and I get yelled at for something so ridiculous, so not important. Or worse, something I have nothing to do with. Thats fun. If the dogs werent so tired, to the point of limping, Id take one out for a walk with me. I need a smoke. I have a ticklish day of professor-ass-kissing on the horizon for tomorrow. I bought her a book from the Getty museum, the exhibit she encouraged us all to go see. Schmoozed with the checkout man, and he gave me about six free bookmarks on the same theme. A bonus gift, kind of like at the Clinique counter. Casey dog is having dog dreams, woofing quietly to herself on my bed, little red legs twitching along with her lids. Weve renamed her now that shes 8 and getting on with age. Skeletor-dog. White skeletal outlines on her red face. Cracks me up whenever I see her, no longer able to take butchdog seriously.

 YAY, Andy!!!

 Write-Up for my Literature Professor, Heather Hayton: Im a little road-weary after a long day speeding down LA freeways. But better to reflect on the days adventures at the Getty museum now than wait until tomorrow. I left San Diego today around one oclock, heading up the 405 to the museum with my friend Bryan. Hes the pal of mine I take with me to Europe, to queer plays, to eccentric restaurants when no one else could stomach my impulses. Luckily for me, there was a photography exhibit going on at the Getty that drew him out of his hibernation and exciting him to come with me. Our mutually favourite film is Woody Allens Manhattan, something we crack each other up by quoting at length. The reference to Diane Arbus is a particular point of laughter for us, so when he learned that a showing of her photography was being presented, he couldnt refuse my offer to take him up there. Lot of nudging each other, muttering lines about steel cubes and plexiglass sculptures. A good snickering session behind us, we meandered back to the Illuminated Manuscript and The Making of a Medieval Book exhibits. I was a little surprised at how small the offerings were. I remember the last time I was there when the section was blocked off to prepare for it. I suppose I could have guessed at the dimensions of space that was reserved for the exhibit. Still, I thought thered be a bit more to see. The manuscripts were simply beautiful. Intricate hand drawn illustrations to accompany immaculately printed gothic and humanistic script. I was reminded immediately of the exhibit I saw recently in spring at the Royal Academy of Arts in London (incidentally, the site of this exhibit once it leaves the Getty). I went a couple of months ago, seeing the highly praised Aztec exhibition. In it was a selection of Spanish codices, most notably the Florentine Codex. Realising what I was seeing blew me away. These were the books created by the Conquistadores intending to explain to folks back home what they were seeing in the New World and the customs of the natives they encountered. A snapshot of the times. Most things carrying such significant historical weight are a little mind-blowing to stare at. As artefacts of the nature of knowledge and learning for past generations, I find ancient books so interesting. The aged leather bindings are so beautiful, I couldnt help but want to touch them through the glass. However aware I am of the likelihood that my flesh would burn getting that close to a bible. The exhibit opens with a piece of skin from a stillborn goat stretched out on a contraption reminiscent of things Ive seen in a torture museum. There is something oddly hostile to see a religious text printed on the skin of a miscarried animal. Does this bother anyone? I suppose its gold leaf flourishes obscure the fact that the books are made from vellum. The Illuminated Manuscripts room had a few pieces of interest. To get a better sense of context, I tried to transport my mind to the time when encyclopaedic knowledge of the natural world was not yet available. The detail of these drawings was impressive. The delicate rendering of Jan van Kessels butterflies and insects did justice to the subjects subtle nature. I especially liked the stag beetle image drawn up by Drer. The shadows and the subjects position made it seem as if the image was living, rising up off of the page. The realism these artists achieved was amazing to me. I envy those with the ability to paint with such precision. The tunes of the Seatbelts carried me home while my exhausted playmate slept in the passenger seat. All in all, the day was a stunning success. With a fun museum-issue book to commemorate the trip, the two of us drove home under a crisp summer sky with renewed resolve to return to the Getty more than twice a year. And of course, I was propelled by my anxious excitement to get home to once again pop in my DVD of Manhattan. What a beautiful day!

 Oh, happy days. I could wax poetic about the way things can sometimes seem to all come together at once, but I know the feeling wont last as long as my long-winded propensities. I did the walk-through today at the new condo. The place looks fabulous. Quite appeasing to this OCD set of eyes. Pristine, empty, white and brand spankin new. Sure, there were some things that needed to be altered or finished, one being the fingerprint I accidentally put on the freshly painted fence out back. And they hauled my fridge all the way up stairs to the /wrong/ unit and have to bring it back down and put it into my kitchen. The washer and dryer are in their garage too. But what a view! And the breeze that comes through that place makes air-conditioning flat-out unnecessary. Its so fantastic. The vaulted ceilings in the master bedroom above these big beautiful windows are just screaming for long, languid mornings in bed with a book and coffee. Oh, the joy. And since my night class that I just came home from was so unrelentingly boring, I decided to sketch out the floor plan complete with crude renderings of furniture placement, complete with all these annotated stage notes for all the major players. Like, I still need a couch, but I have to plan ahead to quell the longing to get all the shit I do have into that place. Im planning to sleep on an inflatable bed the very night escrow closes and I get those sweets keys to my kingdom. Thinking my little routines may be thrown off course and provide a potential for slippage, I have to admit theres a touch of apprehension. Any change is difficult. And it involves loss, even when loss is beneficial (like, losing that constant self-monitoring that comes with living with parents). But to augment this, I found out tonight from a classmate that the school now has a gym on campus thats new and free to all students! Hooray! No having to drive all the way back to Claudialand, aka Encinitas, to get a sweat on. And better yet, this is something I can do during those long breaks between classes that make my Wednesdays so long and tiring for me. Like, today I went to Penny Lane and ate lunch and read a bunch. I could have eaten at home and read while burning a few. Got to keep meself operating at max capacity when Im actually up and running. Capitalise on the upswings, as I always say. Incidentally, I was invited to go out with a couple of girls, Morgan and Kelly, from my literature track. Weve had a class together over summer, ending up in the same small groups for daily collaborative work. This term, we have two more classes together. I told them about a bar in Hillcrest one class meeting that they ended up going to and loving. NuNus. A dive thats 100% charm. Were grouped together again in the Epics and Their Heroes class where Ive taken the reigns to craft a hilarious rewriting of The Epic of Gilgamesh into a queer romantic comedy. Were getting on swimmingly. So today, they asked me what I was doing this Saturday, whether Id like to come on out with them and their other friends to NuNus. Hell yeah! Morgan rules, if nothing else its on account of her Varga Girl t-shirt. I like them both, the inseparable pair who even go to the bathroom together. Its a crack up. I think itll be fun. Our sense of humour all seem to match up pretty well. And maybe I can drag them out to Bourbon Street, the very BEST bar in the city, after were done with NuNus. By the way, class with Heather Hayton today was moving. She told us a story about herself to qualify her passion for the material were covering. Really exposed her humanity talking about her life, her exposure to killing animals and how her capacity to perform such things fell away when she had her babies. Reading this violent kind of poetry really affected her. I sit in the back (next to the girls), but when she ended her story, she looked around and our eyes met. I gave her my most intensely appreciative smile and a super subtle thumb-up to make sure she understood she was well received, at least by me. I was truly moved. Part of my intimidation of her fell away, replaced by admiration. And not just for the fact that she read all these epics in the original old English, Latin, Old French, and then even learned Italian to read Dante in the original. Man, what a hard on I could have for a woman that cool!

 a little tired this morning, so i kept sleeping. could sleep for days on end, it seems. still yawning, still slow to move out of the house and get my butt to school. today's the big walk-through. so there's something to look forward to besides taking a quiz in my epic heros class that begins in twenty. having done all the reading to prepare makes it a joy, not a lament. i don't know what else to say for myself today. it's going to be another long one. best get to it.

 Theres a chance I may be able to get the key for the new place tomorrow afternoon, a couple of days earlier than expected. The funding went through yesterday, leaving just the final walk-through. I wish that was taking place today; I need a project to wrap my head around. Yesterdays settlement hearing didnt go as Id expected. First of all, I only receive about 14,000 after lawyer fees. Second, I dont receive any of it until next year when my vocational rehab is complete. So now what, you ask? The financial bind that has me under the weight of additional/unnecessary stress will not be lifted. I cant work officially until next March or so, and I wont be getting anymore than 800/mo from this until the full amount is paid up. Maybe I will hit up Dad for another loan to kill my credit card balances and just pay him directly as the money trickles in. what a drag I thought Id be feeling so much better today. Speaking of which, I bought a book with a gift certificate that should be arriving today. Thanks, Amy. There was one in mind that Id been meaning to get, something I think I need. Tracy Alderman, the therapist of my dreams, published a couple of self-help books in recent years that speak to my little problemo. Im dying to dig into it, maybe even read it cover to cover this afternoon. Since all the waiting around yesterday for the settlement to finalise provided me time to get on top of all my reading, I dont have a whole lot to do today. Maybe get a huge jump on a paper for my 309B class, the American Lit, second half class. Its so beautiful out, and here I am in jeans and big, brown shoes pretending its winter in Seattle. Slept another marathon session, and still I feel like going back to bed. Or at least reading from bed in a low-lit room. Kerri said something last time I saw her that I keep coming back to. Why dont you ask for a new meds doctor if the one youre seeing isnt working out for you? Good question. Maybe I should call and arrange for that today. This depression is wearing me out. I know its kind of just the way things are, but I keep hearing rumours that its treatable. Funny just makes me want to cancel those helpful appointments and turn inward. Especially after the turn of events that took place between me and my other therapist. Nothing she did. Nothing I did either. Just a surfacing of some feelings that have no where to go but out. Feel like that relationship has me affixed to cement shoes. Eventually, its something I wont be able to tread water to avoid the sinking. Labels I hate to hear but know are true. Labels that take my attributes and flush them down the toilet. Im being vague only because Im too upset to smear the ugliness over this venue too. Time to get the mail... hoping... I need something to do today. Something helpful.

 Somewhat low and depressed leaving the house for dinner, but once I got some sushi in my mouth, I was waking up a bit. Stuffed my face with perfect fish, counting down the minutes until I got to go home to sleep. Im considering it now. Had a really good time, but its just not the same when just being is so exhausting. I wish I could shake this for a couple days a week when I need to be on, need to be social. I was more passive than Axia tonight. I sent a text message to Kerri to thank her for the day, how sweet she was to me. she messaged back to say she loves me. called me honeygirl. Its so good to have her back in my world again. it feels so good to be cared for. Big day of school and court tomorrow. I feel ill-prepared for both, but Im going to have to just show up and do it. theres nothing more I can do to ready myself for either. Just feels like floating not knowing what either is going to feel like in the morning.

 A healing afternoon spent with the fabulously sexy Kerri-Lou. She wanted to take me out for my birthday, go down to Hillcrest and see a movie. So we decided on Thirteen, a film about the hell of early adolescence with the beautiful Holly Hunter as mom. Pretty rough film complete with drug use, cutting, and a shaky, grainy film style that made my head spin at times. The cutting was a bit hard to watch and the scene where mom finally finds out about what her young one has been up to. The end of the film had me in tears, but since the two of us were cuddled up together throughout the movie, it felt safe to experience. Kerri held my head and stroked my face and mouth. So sweet of her to comfort me. so nice to have a chance to be comforted. God, Im still so attracted to that woman. Even after all that weve been through together. I met her when I was just a babe of seventeen. Took one look at her and knew who I wanted to spend my weekend with. Manic and quirky and so charismatic, I clicked with her immediately. We were talking about that today before the movie, how we became instantly close friends from the very first moment we met. Too bad it ended so tragically, both of our respective addictions taking the reigns and (thankfully) pulling us apart. She left town. And I hadnt seen her in six years (her length of sobriety now) until the chance meeting at the GLBT Pride Parade a month or so ago. She still smells the same. The old familiar perfume of a past lover. Shes 41 now and still as sexy as ever. A friendly kiss on the lips as we parted sums it up; I adore her. Shes much easier to love without the needles. Its about time to run out to Japengo for dinner. Id better get dressed.

 Radical! I made it onto the blogger homepage as a fresh blog! Hooray!

 So Im in my room making the bed for the dogs to resume their positions for the first morning round of naps. My mom knocks at the door to tell me my dad is looking for me to ask me a question. No, I didnt assume I was in trouble for something. Thats what its usually about. I guess I must have had a lapse in mental functioning, because for a second there, I thought he was going to ask me to go with them on their shopping trip today. I dont know why I got my hopes up, what it is that inspired me to expect such a thing. maybe that we were supposed to go out today to get stuff for my birthday; that was the deal when they went to Julian and left me alone on my birthday. So now theyre pulling away without a mention of inviting me. I had another strange dream last night. Went to visit Bryan at what turned out to be a commune for a cult. They wouldnt let me leave even when I pleaded with them that they dont want me to be a member because Im gay. Even Bryan stopped trying to help me, seeming quite comfortable with his new life in this alternate reality. I had to leave all my things behind and just make a break for the outskirts of the compound. One member tried to persuade me to stay while I fled, saying how surprised she was that someone that wrote The Glass Bead Game would have any problems with their lifestyle. (I didnt write it, btw. Herman Hesse did) My sexual freedom was more important than anything, why I had to run before they got into my head and took it away from me. the woman didnt understand why that would be so important to me, so I kissed her and she ran off with me. The book, by the way, is about an elite spiritual/intellectual group who spends their time constructing chains of associative connections like glass beads on a necklace. They can go from a piece of music to the natural world, whatever, and the point is to meditate on the connections. The more powerfully sublime, the better. Its, to me, about creating an illusion of interrelation between fragments. To feel the comfort of an underlying scheme, pattern, or some kind of safety netting that lies beneath it all. So, Im running from it. Because I know its false? Just a game of feeling safe? An exercise in our own capacity to fool our rational minds into thinking theres an umbrella of unified significance out there? Shoot. This may be too deep of a conversation to be having with myself before Ive had my coffee. I wrote the book. That was funny. And Im running from its taking-it-as-gospel application. I convinced them all of this way of dealing with the world, and I created a monster. Hahaha!!! Its like therapy in a way, I think. Looking for patterns, relief, a way to put things on a map. Its brainwashing if left unchecked, because ultimately, its just a momentary contemplation that provides relief. Theres no safe community to hide out in. You still have to live in the world. A world that has no threads neatly tying together the fragments.

 Think I ought to give another shot out to my brother whos working overtime (as usual) this weekend for dads company and whatever other consulting projects he has heaped up on his plate. My brother, whos replacing the hard drive that crashed on my desktop. My brother, who bought me this laptop too while I was living in Italy, scared into paralysis, functioning only by virtue of the communication I was able to manage through computers. Without him, I wouldnt have this chance to sit still and write right now, this dreamy late summer afternoon. Pens and paper are so ten years ago! Thanks, Chris. I wish you didnt work so much and we could spend more time together. Blah. Needless emotional outpouring. I suppose Im just a little worn down today. Beat up from the drinking sessions and continual disappointments. Getting a little more mushy than usual. Ok, so I may always be this way just feels a little thinner today, this skin of mine. Glad I made a good choice to call up mom and spend some quality time roaming the aisles at Home Depot together. And of course, spending some time with the dogs, down on all fours growling and barking back at them. Im the third dog, no doubt. I miss that stupid vizsla spending nights in my bed with me. Fucking heavy heart making tears another inevitability. That and the sure-as-shit plan to go out drinking with Luis and his new girlfriend, Robin. What a threesome we could make. Luis was my f-buddy for so many years (until her, coincidentally). And by the way, it was me who asked Robin out first! Shes super smart (so sexy), kind of hunky with a quick wit that isnt too easy to find. I dig her. Yet, shes straight. And with that denial of affection comes the fact that Ive seen Luis all of once in the last month since that relationship began. Dating sucks. Breeders! I guess I could have one for myself tonight, but Id promised to set this night aside for the house tour for Luis. Kerri-Lou text messaged me to say that she skipped out on work early today, wondering if I was up for the booty call I moaned for last night. Making out like teenagers in the car, barely dressed Charlotte in a parking garage in Hillcrest. I would have had her follow me home last night, but the promise of a drunken lay didnt sound too honourable. Like that stops me, je sais, je sais. But whats the point if Im too pissed to come?! Yes, the priorities in my world are firmly in place. I wonder if our age disparity makes a difference in the eyes of others. Then again, were not exactly dating either. Were just on the same page. Lying on the floor of my condo thumbing through my lesbian porn collection (that /so/ needs some new additions), we both cook with lusty gusto and we both have been doing hard drugs for years, delaying our development to where age doesnt seem an accurate measure anymore. Shes about 15, Im about 6. So what? My stomach hurts thinking of what Id posted late last night, so drunk I could hardly see let alone keep metaphors from mixing. Shameful displays like that need to be removed. Glad I have that option. Note to self: do your homework before the long hours of afternoon get to you, before your judgement is impaired by either alcohol or general weariness. And get over yourself you have to reread this before posting or youre going to create unnecessary gastric acid worrying about what could have come off better with second thoughts incorporated into the final produit. I need some cigs and a re-up on the alcohol if Im to have guests. Cook? Go out? Shut off the phones and remain unreachable, cancelling all plans? Hm go for a run, punish the back a bit? Or just lie here in bed and watch the sunset? Beautiful the way the humidity hugs these plushy little hills out here in San Marcos. Warm sunshine on my bare body making me want to nap with the kitty.

 jesus christ, that blog i posted last night is horrible! remind me again never to reread any of this crap. esp. those posts written when that incredibly pissed. what a wanker.

 i can't do this today. been awake thirty minutes and i'm already in tears. think i'll go tell it to the shower head and see if i can't scald it off of me.

 Nothing quite like using your femininity to get revenge on creepy guys. Sure, I dont have window treatments yet, but does that mean I need smelly construction workers staring into my house? Its been happening rather consistently, so this morning I strolled downstairs wearing nothing but a smile. Part exhibitionism, part hostility, I got one quick glance inside before a guilty face turned away. Sometimes I feel like opening the door and confronting them. And yes, I think my arguments have more weight when thats all Im putting before them. Clothes detract from the issues. Woke myself up this morning in my customary fashion. A sudden jolt of panic as if Id gone to sleep with a bomb in my bed. This morning, it was panic about the new cat. Wondering if it could escape or whether I killed it somehow through negligence. Negligence, of course, from sleeping in on a weekend. Bad girl! No, just taking the opportunity to admonish myself for going out and drinking last night. And for having my hands in someones pants during the movie. And maybe too for footing the bill for everyones movie ticket (how did that happen?). I havent seen the dogs all week. And I can tell by the tone of my mood this morning that seeing them will be the only bright spot on the day. No, Im not a cranky pants for drinking (took a darvocet when I got up, knocking out the headache). Im a cranky pants for what happened yesterday. The alcohol only helps to delay the impact of shitty things getting yet another chance to start all over again with a new therapist. At least this one isnt crying in front of me to say she cant help. Or telling me Ive got so much going on she doesnt know where to start. I just cant believe this is continuing. The stability factor is so low, Im off the charts. Time for a naked breakfast. No clothes to remind me why this week of no working out is going to cost me more than my sputtering endorphin level.

 A nasty case of vertigo for the third day now keeping me from being too present for my classes or the time away from school. Im not sure what its from save the chemical exposure Im surely having with all the new materials in the ol homestead. Flashing back to the film SAFE with Julianne Moore wondering if its that new couch (not yet arrived, but youd remember that scene from the film) that has me losing my balance. So here I am, awaiting the third class of the day, doing my reading in between each, then rushing home to be there for various construction workers to come in and tie up loose ends. Today it was the garage. Letting wittle mice into the place. I set a trap last night, and when I awoke saw the little light blinking to signal a kill. But the thing was empty. Either one got away with a good shock to send it scurrying, or the thing went off in error. Who knows. At least therere no new poops in my kitchen. So its Friday that Ill be hooked up again. Of course, I wont be home that night to write and post. Going out with the queers on campus to a film screening at Outfest in Hillcrest, an event Im coordinating. Sure hope my energy picks up and I can manage the long drive down there in Friday traffic. I came out to my neighbours last night. Yesterday afternoon, really. My old flame Kerri Lou was on her way out, smokin hot in her motorcycle gear to dress up her fat ride. We kissed each other goodbye, a kiss that ended up a bit more extended than the last. A little bit of tugging at clothes to punctuate the moment. Glancing up in between episodes, I see my neighbours getting situated to leave. The two of us in plain view. Not a big deal, I know. But still, the moment was weighted for me. Still trying to realize that I no longer live at home under my parents stronghold over my behaviour. When will that subside, I wonder. Best get off the profs computer and post this before she comes in and Im in the way. urlLink stair

 On haitus until i get a telephone/internet connection on Friday. Lo siento for the silence.

 Lord, it feels like I just went to sleep! Kerri Lou just left for work. Had the alarm set for 4:30 knowing wed have a little more time together this morning before she had to go off. Dressed in a wife beater on loan from me and a pair of black work pants, I had to steal a couple more kisses before letting her leave. Sort of in between sleep and making her coffee. I thought Id be off to the gym as soon as she left. Took a shower in the dark in preparation, but now that shes gone all I can think about is going back to bed. So why sit here and write? Why drink coffee when I could be back in the sheets sleeping sound? Oh, that was quite a little experience I had with that woman last night. Me just quaking with pleasure again and again after having her come in my mouth. So beautiful. Getting to watch her take a shower in front of me, this gorgeous figure clad in tattoos. So sexy, this woman. Ive been smitten with her for years, yet this is the first time Ive actually gotten to see her naked. Lovely. I love her smell. I love that shed been at work for 14 hours and I could taste it. I love how soft her skin was after the shower when she finally slid into my bed. Im excited just thinking about it. Im inspired to workout harder this morning. The five pounds Ive put back on during these past weeks of woe are a bother to me. Its not pure vanity as much as it is a matter of how beautiful I feel, more about how I feel about it than what others perceive. I can do better, and I shall. Lord, kids. I cant believe how lovely that was. Fan-fucking-tastic. I was a little afraid of how this would go down before we got into it; its been quite some time since Ive been with a woman. Like, how long? If I cant remember quickly, its been too long. Shoot! I can only remember the boys, and those dont even count as far as Im concerned. Such a stereotypical lesbian scene, the jealous cat watching us. He tried humping her while we were downstairs on the floor earlier in the night. Does this little thing where he lets out some cat cries and bites down on you, kind of hunkers down in his straddle. I let him do it once to see if hed do what the dogs so enjoy, but he seemed confused and lost himself in the moment. Stupid neutral cat. Maybe all my hormones are influencing him. I did start bleeding last night. Funny how it stops during sex until you come. Clorox and white sheets, here I come. Summoning Lupita, my cleaning woman alter ego. Enough with the sordid details, yes? Someones going to do some search on lesbian sex and my page will turn up. I did need to take a pain pill to function without the sciatica ache. Even if Kerri did give me a massage (yet as always, she goes first), my back felt like it always does. Threatening me to be cautious. I should have received a million in compensation just for that. Who has the will to remain cautious? Its such a gyp to be handicapped. Kerri left me toys. Of the stuffed animal variety, nothing inspired by energizer. I think Ill take it upstairs for a bedmate and resume sleep. Hit the gym in the afternoon. I just want to get back into those sheets and smell what the two of us became. At least until the sun comes up.

 I got a big laugh tonight. Talking about Jack London's story _South of the Slot_ in my US Lit class. So I says, "Is that a euphemism?" Laughter ensued. Points won. Doing a little catch-up work this evening now that the days over and my back is feeling better. Yep, I can sit up pretty comfortably. Glad I took that extra time this afternoon to sleep some more. Nothing works better than added rest to fix it. Ordered a couple of things off of Amazon for gifts. A Bill Bryson book I think my dad would get into. And a DVD for Axia. Hope they show up sooner than our plans to meet for dinner. Feeling a little crappy still. I was getting weepy in my afternoon Brit Lit class. Another thing sleep tends to help fend off. In truth, I should probably go back to bed now. Yet I feel like maximising the time conscious and thinking by doing another one of my explications thats due by Sunday night. Yet, I know Im not in the proper state of mind to do my best work. Ive got a cat, you guys. He follows me around the house and poops in a box. What could be so bad that this fact doesnt offset? Vato gato. Now, time to do what I should have done yesterday before I wrecked my back; sit on the couch and watch tv. Fucking relax!

 My back su-ucks! And I suppose so is my ability to shut off the projects when Ive had enough. I got caught in it yesterday and last night. Hanging pictures, touch-up painting the walls and even spray painting the wipers on my car that had been reflecting sun in my eyes. Assembling some crappy lamp from target, vacuuming, vacuuming and then it seized on me. I was up until four am before I crawled upstairs. Just laying on the floor with my knees up. And yes, wishing I wasnt living alone so someone could help me. At least bring me a pillow and turn off the telly so I could sleep where I landed. Or tell me earlier that its time to go to bed and end my compulsive rampage. No such luck. Today feels like Ill be lucky to get through a shower. Im going to stretch, hopefully enough to loosen the binding. Another day of sick feelings from either pain or pain pills. Ive got some old codeine, and Im not afraid to use it. Shoot. 13 months and three days. When do I get to be better?

 so i changed my mind, and instead of looking for and printing a bunch of pics of questionable pixel size, i decided to just print out two of the photos i've taken in the past years. these ones: well, it looks like "that service is unavailable." so i'll post them again another time. the mania of home improvement is on high. i won't be able to sleep tonight. school tomorrow? can i manage it? we'll see when i finally come off of this. and here i thought the beer and sedatives would prevent such a thing. at least i have a bathroom attendant kitty. you know what i mean; my AnnieDog was the same way. everytime you go, there's an animal sitting there at the door waiting to be pet. why, i wonder. Annie at least like to eat the toilet paper cardboard when a roll is done. why is this cat coming to watch?

 Blessed baseball.... good-ass background noise. Its not about quantity! Its about control! I couldnt stand my workout regimen being so compromised. I wanted to go down to the Enc. YMCA for some elliptical sweating, but the traffic was already getting whacked-up by three oclock. So as I stand here making dinner and sipping on beers, I thought Id grab the one soccer ball I have that isnt totally flat and go out in the front and do a bit of small-area work. Juggling could go on forever if I used my thighs. Only if I have to, then I send it back down to my feet. And keeping it below my knees is the real trick. Seeing if I can top 30 that way, then 40. a little side-rolling and quick starts to remind myself that my brain and body have spent decades working on that collaborative communication. I impressed myself, really. I didnt last too long (with a lit cigarette in my hand), but I got a sweat on. Got a chance to get purely fun exercise, not just the hardcore cardio stuff. So Ive got the laptop downstairs in the kitchen. I made some sauce this afternoon to utilise all those fabulous tomatoes given to me by mom and those picked up at the farmers market a few days ago. Seeing as though I dont have all the spices Id like to fill up the spicebox in the pantry, I decided to get creative. Its flat-out fabulous, of course. Used some pesto from the freezer supply, some extra garlic, paste, mushrooms, hot sauce, vinegars, salt, sake. Just got to settle on an hour to fake an appetite, and its done. Im downloading the driver for my printer. Guess I hadnt done that before, paired the two together. What I want it for is to print out homework assignments and to do a couple of high-res printouts of black and white photos. I got some things at Cost Plus, including some frames, that I was driven to return home to play with. Actually, I left the store thinking I would go down south to the gym and to pick up some more of my many meds. But when I left the place, I hit a skid of depression. Turned off the 5 freeway and came back home. Shitty. I hit the traffic anyway, just less of it. So I set my table. Something about leaving a beautiful dining room table all set for company that tickles me. I didnt spend much. But of course, I found some of those small project caps that gave me a dose of much appreciated gratification. Oh, I had so much to bitch about today, but Ive lost my fury. A shot of codeine always helps to kill it. At least my back doesnt hurt. I was able to kick a ball around to myself and not come in aching, laying flat on the floor for relief. Is that worth it, I wonder? Id better just suck it up and pretend to finish off dinner. Got some perciatelli to boil up. Now thats a pasta I wish I could make from scratch! Need a machine for tubes. Off to hunt for photos. and root on the Cubs.

 great. i'm in deep shit now. just checked the bstats page, letting me know about my site's hits. someone (please, please God. don't let it have been her) searched for my cool lit teacher. i won't even say her name in case it comes up again for others' searches. yikes. i blew it - i removed that post, but i forgot to "republish entire site" to get it off the server. fucking fool. oh well. i suppose i'd tell it to her face if she wasn't married and my grade wasn't still in question. after all, she is incredibly intelligent and super adorable. i've never been good at keeping those opinions to myself, voicing them only to folks in private.

 is that colonel sanders on the "No on 54" ads?

 I came upstairs to catch up with the rants, but when I got up here and flipped on the telly, my mind changed. No, Im still going to rant; just now its going to be about different things! Ok Good Try Gray Davis Team!! Just like youd expect, hes running and ad to try his hand at validating his conduct. And of course, hes banking on the general stupidity of his constituents. Why, he /was/ reelected! What fact could better prove that my fellow statesmen are morons? Ok, so the add is like, Governor Davis budget spending increased less during his regime [ok, ok:] during his term in office than all these former California governors. Blah, blah, blah. The list ends with even Ronald Regan! Like, this is supposed to absolve him of guilt? Wait, dumbshit whats the question again? Increasing spending? How about looking at the ratio between state INCOME and monies spent!? An increased budget isnt the point. And Jesus Christ, want to look at the growth the state went through under Regan? The budget increased back then because we could afford to spend!! Man, the way these guys go after votes makes me ashamed to be part of the target audience. Although then again, political ads arent meant for those who can actually think and formulate an opinion through independent research. Its for those who watch 22 minute sitcoms each night. Whose lives can be summed up in between commercial breaks. Ah, well. This is ending up being the perfect segue into the bitch Ive been saving up for about a week now. Question: What sucks worse than the crap aired on primetime network TV? The culture standing behind it! Its not so much how /bad/ this stuff is, its the worship of the audience. This faithful following drooling over each stunning episode of Temptation Island. The idiots that treat the death of John Ritter like a national tragedy!! Come on, folks. We all have a soft spot for the girls and Mr. Ropers nasty, horny wife. But this is someone who entered our living rooms of old through the advent of Threes Company!!! Evaluate your worlds! This is /not/ a significant contribution to our culture. Jesus, I hear that Edward Said died this weekend, and the only place youd even hear about it is on an NPR newscast. So I almost feel like I need to watch some of this shit just so I know what Im whining about. Such a devastation to lose my access to Showtime and HBO. But you know, I cant do it. This stuff is so awful. When I spent the extra money to actually have cable here at the new pad, it was a matter of rage-control driving me. ABC cant be the only background noise in my house. Id rather have constant coverage of natural disasters and political assassinations on CNN than watch an episode of canned laughter and atrocious comedy writing (should I say that in quotes?). I do get it, folks. We project ourselves onto these public figures. Ritter is like the guy everyone knows who ends up dropping dead on the sidewalk at 55 as hes leaving work. We care because its as close to real as a lot of us get. But Christ! Its a shitty sitcom anyway! Raise your sights! Wow, my fury has dissipated. Must have been that really serious issue I wanted to get off my chest for days now, the weight just lifting right off. And here I was thinking it was the request of my newest ex-therapist to say goodbye properly that had me so upset! Gee, thats nothing! BTW: are you kidding? How much more masochistic could I be, agreeing to do that? Nah, I think Id rather re-hospitalize myself with a sharp object than sit there and have to go through that again. That being the talk, the one where I have to sit there all composed and deal with losing another trusted connection. ooh, lord, saying those words just sent something rip through me. I cant do it, you guys. Ive lost too much in total to make it through. Its not my last ditch effort to hold onto some power over her, my rejection to the offer/proposition. Truthfully, I really couldnt possibly share my grief with anyone for this being cast adrift again. Its big enough that at least Im left in disbelief that its happening again. If I shut it out, it can happen gradually over the next couple of months. Im not up for it all right now.

 bleatban.jpg"> Sure glad I did the homework required of me for Heathers class. Visibly upset to the point of condescension, she was fuming politely at our class for our collective inability to pull off an online explication using WebCT. And quite honestly, I felt sorry for her. She goes to the trouble of explaining how to get into the system over and over gain during class time, and still about a quarter of the class fucks it up and cant get in. Or just failed to pay attention to her deadline instructions. Im glad I pay too close attention to things, even those too small to lose sleep over. I would hate to have alienated myself, thrown into the category of the 13 people whose names I have on a list who couldnt manage the assignment. I think Id cry if I got her upset with me. Instead, I got her to approach a group of three of us having a smoke outside of class to ask face-to-face whether she was being too aggressive or mean about the whole thing. I didnt say it, but what really angers me is that those of us who have the wherewithal to get our work done will end up being penalized for it; the others get more time to work on it, and now that the deadline has passed, they also get the benefit of knowing the explication questions ahead of time. Bastards! I think I expected to be a lot more preoccupied this morning in her classes. A little afraid of being there after my blgo blunder. Yall know me, and by that you have a context to place the things I write about in here. But she she was not supposed to get on that group emailing list announcing my triumphant (and depressing) return to the writing/fighting lines. I ate a whole roll of tums this weekend worrying about the mistake. Then today, instead of shrinking into myself, I actually had things to contribute to class. Calling out page numbers for passages of note, making connections about the colour of the green knight in Sir Gawains story and the metaphorical meaning to it, reminding her when she asked where we left off the class before in another class. I dont think Ive spoken that much in all my class meetings with her so far this semester. Weird how that ended up working out. Not yet taken a good long look at the poetry assignments for this class about to start. Mainly just focused on a mini-explication due to be graded and handed back. Im sure I did well, and I want the boost. When all goes to hell, what always feels better is to rake in the successes (however small) at school. Self-identification fortified with some positives for once.

 Darned pain pill nausea punishing me for not having taken any darvocet in a couple of days. Lucky really not to be hungover post Radiohead, but then again, I had to drive us and therefore had some limits beyond cash keeping me from knocking too many back. Still, meds of all colours and sizes eith compounded influence of a late night/little sleep has me pretty slow to respond today. Speaking quietly, blurred focus. Got another class to attend before I can join my kitty on the bed, stretched out with no movement beyond a twitching nose breathing in the windows gusts. I knocked the ball around for a quick spell this morning. In part for exercise, also for ego reaffirmation purposes. I dreamt of soccer last night. And then awoke with that dull aching in my legs and butt reminding me that my days of athletic prowess are far behind. It hurts my back these days just trying to sit down. A sickening feeling from the pain that seems to have no sign of subsiding soon. Part of me thinks just laying here on the bed with my laptop is enough for the inbetweenclass break, but I know Im being too indulgent. I have errands to run, poetry to read. I can be slothful at 2:15, no sooner. I love school. Yet I think Ive allowed my personal life to exhaust me to where Im not getting as much out of my classes as I want. Feels more like endurance than enjoyment. Whats the point of that?

 "Cauterized for Your Protection" If you look outside the nightmare of personal troubles (hahaha...), I have a perty great little life. Tonight is shaping up to be nothing less than the second coming of Christ. I get to go see my FAVOURITE band of the last ten years tonight at Coors. Mr. Mark is taking me, Stro, the boy who I once wanted to drown in the toilet for saying something stupid to me after a night of consequence-free sex. Yall remember now. Hes tried and tried to make it up to me (Ive only seen him once by chance at a PB bar since that crappy morning). I think this night will overshadow his verbal blunder. Its RADIOHEAD, for Gods sake!! Glad I got to my marathon of reading earlier in the week. Doesnt look like Ill be doing much more today than nursing a hangover and making ground towards another one. And hitting the Adams Avenue Street Fair to do some more used book shopping. Luis reclaimed a bunch of his books from my shelves last night. Well, tit for tat, Im asking for my Thomas Pynchon collection back! (Mason-Dixon might tip the car alla Fred Flintstone) I didnt completely think about it the other night, but when I sent out the blog renewal notice, I added a couple of email addresses to the mix that I shouldnt have. No, not to the folks. It would hurt them far too much to read this crapola. But to Hayton and Martha Stoddard-Holmes, profs of mine whove made their way into my address books. Im using the laptop a whole different interface of settings and such that Im not used to. Outlook is a pain on this puter, so I use an online access that goes directly to SIMS. So, oops. I can smell an anxiety attack from here. Hopefully, Ill be so post-coital from the concert that I wont notice I have reason to feel ashamed for the unnatural exposure when I show my face at school tomorrow. My stomach is already turning. (yet, whats the diff? I tell all /you/ of the intimate details of my sickness. What, like theyre going to give me a public caning for the offence of putting things to words? Relax, jackass) Oh my, its RADIOHEAD! I cant wait, I cant wait. I need to get moving here smoke a bit to shake the hangover. Magic cure known by professional drunks around the globe.

 i feel much better this morning. a night of troubled sleep, alternately freezing and sweating, tells me i was just going through the motions of a little sickness. having eaten less than 500 calories in the past three days can't be helping. meds, man. i dreamt i was breaking or giving away everthing i own in preparation to kill myself in a public presentation. creepy. rageful words with my mom. strange dream. yes, i had a lot on my mind last night. a few more pounds lighter here at the end of the week. back to the gym before i run off with Trevor. i should eat something.

 Ooh! Now wasnt /that/ fun? I just spent the morning in a SOC meeting for our campus student organisations and then ran off to meet a young guy at Student Health Services for an evaluation before beginning therapy with them. An hour of dishing my whole lifes history which Im pretty used to doing considering how many folks Ive had to relay the information to. But the recent history stuff is always a lot closer to the surface. I dont know how I feel about it, save for a little confident in myself for being able to talk about it with a composed demeanour and not feel too overwhelmed after the fact. Its a little after one oclock, but it seems like its still early in the morning. I was up all night after falling asleep on the couch too early to catch Kerri coming off of work. I did too much house cleaning, got myself into a frenzy, then fell asleep once I finally ate more than a banana for the entire day. Tuckered out. Not today though. Today I feel good, got things to do and more to plan for. And the promise of seeing KerriLou tonight when she gets off of work. Mail server slow. Not able to see my mail. Think Im supposed to go babysit Trevor this weekend from tomorrow afternoon until Tuesday morning, but I dont know what time I need to be there. A little hesitant leaving a sick kitty at home alone for so long, but at least I can shoot back out here with or without Trevor to give him his medicine and play a while. I think it will be good to spend some time with the boy. Ill get my homework done, thats for sure. And smoke a whole lot less seeing as though I have to hide it from him. I cut my hair yesterday. Looks a lot like it did back when Elizabeth had her wedding except without the black in it. I think I like it, but Im not quite sure what to do with all the curls. Less weight on it. Looks better than the ragged trims I usually get. The girl at the haircut place talked me into it. It looks best half wet. Kittys doing better. He greeted me at the door just now. I think his spirits are up now that hes feeling better, but hes mad at me for sticking a syringe in his mouth to squirt in antibiotics. Money well spent if he regains full health. Hes such a fox, my Vato. One of these days Ill have pictures to post. But until then, its just silly shit my dad sent to me: I think Im going to go work out. Ill post this later since the connection seems troubled. Wow! What a fancy new gym! And what a good girl I was leaving under an hours time! Ill be back! Oh, yes

 poor Vato. not only did he have an infection in his nasal passages, his ear had a yeast infection that needed attention. so he's on antibiotics, both oral and topical, and should be better in a week. thankfully i took him there in time to get it treated. poor little guy is moping about with his ears out flat to the sides. they gave him a shot for the intibiotics to first start kicking in, and i don't think he liked it.

 Vatos day at the vet and Charlottes day at the gym. I dropped a couple of pounds this week in a mad rush to return to my normal size. Actually, thats not true; I lost weight because the drugs Im on are preventing me from having an appetite. The weight loss is just a side effect. But I do take the drop with gratitude. Ive been meaning to reclaim my body. Big day of writing a paper and studying for an exam. Im not sure I pulled off my best performance, but its over with and Im feeling the relief this morning. Brain is kind of flatlining because of it, I think. What I want out of the day is nothing more than a good sweat and to catch up with my reading. Kerris at work all day and most of the night, so Im on my own.

 Oh, great audience who hast listen'd to my bleating! Read on, I implore you! I so should be either sleeping or doing more reading. But I think I deserve a break from all the festivities of school to do a little blogging on the side. And a little IM session with Bryan while I do it. Went out to see lost in translation with Ms. Lou tonight. Wonderful film with all the subtlety of a well-made foreign. Took no short cuts, did nothing artificial to force the story in a predictable Hollywood direction. Very nice. And of course, sitting cosily with my girl felt fantastic. A couple of looks from breeders in the theatre, but we ventured out on our own planet uncaring. Legs and arms intertwined, a bit erotically at times. I get a boner just thinking about her. Being so close is even more intense. And then I had to make the decision to come home to my homework and studies instead of just relenting. Have the woman spend the night with me. And you know, our energies seemed perfectly paired this evening. It had explosive potential. But then theres something to be said about holding out. Delicious tension of waiting. Until tomorrow night, giving me time to finish my paper due tomorrow night and to prep for a test in the afternoon. Still reading on with my Chaucer in Middle English. its a hoot trying to speak it; I hope Heather goes into more of it with her educated tongue tomorrow. That woman, you guys. How she fits so perfectly into me in every way shes outside my normal world, my day-to-day dealings, making it a lot safer for the traumatised girl I am. I dont have to struggle to integrate it into the rest of my academic life. And shes a trusted soul Ive known in many different ways in the years passed. I dont have any pretence with her, emotionally or otherwise. I say the absolute truth, and shes on the same page as me. No uncovered dynamite with fuses lit under the surface. I voice my reservations and fears, and its received safely. And when Im feeling it so entirely that I think Im going to burst into pieces, shes this powerhouse of strength whos eager to take it on. Feeling it like like I couldnt stand to let her go home tonight, but she helped me reaffirm the strong part of me that told her I need to study. I love her. I always have. Just knew better at that young age when we first became friends that I was in no position to take on the desire full-force and do it justice. The drugs stood in the way, along with my youth, and of course my confidence. Im growing within myself. KerriLou is my needed dose of sunshine. Bless that woman. Bless us both for coming together now and not before.

 A little after nine oclock. Some football on the telly and a cold one opened and sitting on its safety pedestal on the coffee table. Blacktastic cat blowing his nose on the carpet on account of the smoke wafting in from the garage where Ive made my cigarette nest. Tummy stuffed with a crab enchilada from Fidels in Solana Beach where I shared a pitcher of margaritas with Amy and the gang. Its a good night home alone. I wanted to invite KerriLou over, but I need my sleep and my downtime. However wonderful it is to share my bed with that sweet woman. Spent half the day with a hard on thinking about her, the two of us, how passionate her email was that she sent to me this afternoon. I think I know just what to do with it too, but I want to take a bath first and do some reading before I tucker myself out completely. Thinking back to last night when I went out to dinner with the family. We had just finished our caesars, my dad and Chris were in an involved conversation, and my mom looked at me in a moment and smiled openly. Im happy! she declares. It was one of those altered moments when acknowledgement of the mood sets it aside from the rest. I was happy for her. But then she asks me, Are you? And I balked. And I lied and said yes. Granted, Im doing damn better than I could be. But theres still so much trouble brewing. I have some aces in my pocket, yes. Got in to see a school therapist for Friday. I have my KerriLou keeping my bed warm and helping me to feel closer to my passionate places that I dont often find myself. These are good things. I feel like I connected with my sweet professor Martha today too when I sent her an encouraging email today to follow up on a class meeting where folks were incredibly rude to her. It made me feel good to hear that she needed the pep talk. It feels good to care about people and have it received. Have it received as its intended, not as a manifestation of some interpersonal problem of mine. Maybe it was being with my parents. The comfort level of being able to let down and actually admit to mom and myself that Im not fully able to experience the joy with her. It hurt my heart when she asked me. The moment separated me from her, underscored the division I feel with a lot of people these days. Im on drugs to facilitate overcoming it, but its there nonetheless. Im still struggling. And Im getting help with it, but what are you gonna do? Axia sent me some information on translating jobs, but I dont feel nearly secure enough about my French these days than would inspire confidence in pursuing any of it. My lust for graduate school is dwindling; I dont have the grades, and I dont feel Im prepared emotionally to take on something that incredible. I could do it if I felt confident, but I dont. maybe its the courses Im enrolled in now; theyre not my specialty. I dont feel like Im doing more than whats required, and thats the separating factor between an A undergraduate student and an A graduate student. I envy Heather Hayton. I envy her passion and her drive. She didnt have an easy go of things to get her to where she is now. She worked her ass off with no help from others, so I hear. I really respect her. And yet being in her presence makes me feel helplessly inadequate. I wish she taught something Im good at like a filmed literature class so I could show her Im quality. Not this esoteric epic stuff. Not this reading Chaucer in Middle English. Why do I need her validation? She knows who I am, I realised today. She called me out to read that passage. Does she know me for getting a decent grade on my timed explication? Or is it this site that revealed my nuttiness? And further, do I need her to know that Im out of my tree to qualify my experience in her class? Do I need her to know how bad Im struggling to give context to my sub-perfect performance? Or is it a cop out? Or is it my overarching sense of self that I feel is a necessary component to give context to my presented persona? Why do I feel the need to present my complete self to someone whos not my friend, only my professor? I know literature classes require more of a personal approach than do other disciplines. You bring your experiences to the table when you read a piece of literature, we all know that. But imagine that she doesnt care to know. Let go. Char let go. As Kerri calls me. I really wish she was here. I still have my bath and my rabbit to look forward to, but neither sound compelling to me anymore. Guess individual pleasures only go so far. I love her boxers, this fabulous shirt she wears that Im trying desperately to steal. And her yummy white tanks stretched across her chest. Those pretty little feet with gracious curves and purple nails. Her skin and my hands get along famously. I wish I had an entire night of nothing but touching her. Shes such a good girl. Seeing her wrapped in my sheets this morning made it so difficult to summon the resolve to get my butt to school. I wanted to crawl back in there with her. I kissed her thigh and felt the warmth I was missing out on. At least it would have been nice to leave the house knowing her sweet self was still sleeping in my bed. I think its about time for that bath in the dark with a candle or two. Bring some sweet songs of Ray Charles in with me. And sleep long and sound.

 Only a couple of minutes before class now that all my errands have been taken care of, but I wanted to get in and hammer away at the keyboard for a bit. Tried before my early class, but the fucking computer seized up, and I had to quickly reboot it so that Heather didnt get pissed about a student messing with her computer. Not that shed kill me, but Id prefer not to upset her. You know how it is. Somewhat ill prepared for the week considering the weekend of many social encounters that just passed. Amy in from Barbados along with annie and Adrian from up north, then having the sweet KerriLou off from work for an extended spell. I hardly cracked open a book. The paper I thought Id already written for Wednesdays due date is forever lost on the dead C drive. So I have to start over and catch up on a bit of reading including a quick reread of the Iliad and part of the Aeneid, then to reading Chaucer in Middle English. It was cute; Heather reading to us and then asking for one of us to say it back to her. She chose me, and I choked through it. Managed the guttural sounds, but I balked in the beginning with nerves. I feel a bit overextended, but on the upside, the meds seems to be working their magic. A lot less impulse to cut, less of those long hours of a turning stomach worrying about my shortcomings. I have the energy. Save for the constant pain that still plagues me, I seem to be doing a lot better these days. Due in no small part to my friendly f-buddy who shares my bed here and there. Another night spent together it was a bit less lusty for me (I wasnt feeling very sexy for some reason, i.e. hormones and such) and a lot more discursive. Im finding some of my hesitant self speaking up to test the safety of the situation. Interpersonal dealings are loaded for me, for all of us. Thankful I am that the two of us have a history long established behind us to make the emotional negotiating a lot easier. Define it? Nah I dont like that avenue. Its fun, and if were lucky well both come away with what we need from each other.

 Left alone in this giant house. The boys are down at the guest house playing airsoft. My Trevor and his two friends. Im always secretly jealous when he invites friends over when Im babysitting. I like to have him all to myself. We went to lunch at Ricos, our haunt when were together. I watched him wolf down a burrito as big as my leg before he grabbed the scraps off my plate of flautas. Growing boys need their nourishment! Well, like the good mother figure I am, I then took him to Duck Waddles Emporium in Leucadia to do some card shopping. Yeah, the same Ducky Waddles that sells everything Betty Page. Probably not the best environment to take a kid with all the nudity and counterculture influences, but I could tell he was thrilled at the miniature rite of passage. After all, he turns 13 this month. Thinking back now that my brother lost his virginity at that age hardly believing it. We did a bit more shopping. I have fun walking around with him as if hes my adorable son. Im almost old enough to be his mom. Hes so wonderful, I just love him. He cracked up the guy at GI Joes with a quick one-liner, and I was so proud of him. So theyre down the hill at the guest house. This is /so/ Rancho Santa Fe. We saw a 600,000 ferrari on its way home. All the women in their Sunday sweatsuits to downplay all the work theyve had done to their bodies. Just another casual weekend day in the ranch. Theres 150,000 dollars worth of porche and bmw in the garage right now, and theyre not even home with their third car. The money some of these people have acquired blows me away. Dinner tonight with the parents at Firenze. Guess Ill have to change out of my new cammo tank top. And if I didnt have school so damned early tomorrow, Id be going out with wonderful Amy again tonight. God, its good to see her again! But since its going to have to be an early night, I decided to stay in and have the party come to me; I invited Miss Kerri Lou over. Lord, I cant wait to see her. She sent me a passionate email today that touched me. This is such a different side of me Im experiencing. So much more joy than shame and self-loathing than Im used to. Fucking breath of fresh air, Ill tell you all. Its just fun, and thats so what I need to be bonding with. [btw: yes, Im getting paid 10/hr to blog. What am I going to do? Grab one of their guns and hijack their game? Actually.]

 Ive got another few minutes before the Simpsons episode comes on, so Im watching Rivera fill in for OReilly. But what Im really doing is trying to figure out what to do with myself tonight and this weekend. Yes, the tattoo buzz is getting to me. I know what I want; Im just searching for an interesting drawing of it. A labrys. An ancient minoan symbol of feminine power. Its a little overused, true. But still, the weapons symbology came from the butterfly along with the association of transformation. I think of it as a fitting counterpart to my ankle tattoo. Im thinking about it. Wonder if I can find someone to come out and watch me do it. The last tattoo I got, I did it alone. No one to go with me, and I really wanted some pain sanctioned by at least one fragment of society. My body and its markings have been in my head in a new way in past weeks. I thought about doing what Id originally intended with my star tattoo and fill it in with wild colours. But this afternoon I need balance on my bod. Wanda Sykes! On OReilly!! I love her!! She used to work for the NSA?!! Holy crap! Wonders never cease. Shes cute. Id recognise that toosh anywhere! Dumb comment about transgenders by Bill. What a jackass. I need to get out and do something tonight. I think I can drum up some support to get something done with ink and an angry needle. I want it on my foot. Will they do it? I know where I want to go but it looks lie a night with luis and robin at her house will suffice. she lives on ariane!! the neighbourhood i grew up in!! luis asks me, "do you know the area?" i screamed my yes. my little childhood will be evoked all night long. lovely... i should go. lucky me i just stopped off for a 30/bottle of alexander valley cabernet. perfect. as soon as i finish the one i started a couple of hours ago. cheers, y'all. would only be better if kerri was with me.

 Got some time here before I have company. Got the last American league baseball game playing in the background. Seems to be over, but theres still two innings to go. I tried downloading some music tonight on Kazaa, but my connection is so slow its hardly worth it. Plus I cant transfer anything to disk from this thing, my laptop. Still, I had to get at least half of the Pixies Monkey Gone to Heaven since it has been in my head for weeks. Even partial gratification is better than none. I picked up a couple of things for the girl while I was out today. Even picked myself out a CD to play with. Some of what we listened to together last night Shelby Lynne. Only a couple of songs Im super into. The one called I thought it would be easier is getting top-shelf priority. Cant wait to get copies of Kerris collection. Cant wait to have my desktop back and can burn my own again. Sounds like this weekend is when its going to happen. This monkey's gone to heaven I went nuts again cleaning the house. Vacuumed the carpet including the stairs, windexed everything, cleaned the cat crap (all over the place! That messy boy!), lit some candles and sauted up some shrimp in spice to satisfy the stomach. Food sounds uninteresting like Im only eating because I have to. And cleaning cause I want to. Nothing I like better than an immaculate house. Control-central. Im finally sitting down. I need to work on that do it more often. Go easy. I did a workout today that made yesterdays look like a marathon. Legs were tight and heavy today, so I kept it to 20 minutes of cardio and only 100 sit-ups. After what happened to my back yesterday after all that work, Im quite aware of the risks involved with pushing myself too hard. Its just not worth the pain if Im now refusing to eat anymore darvocet. Pedro Martinez gets out of a jam. Looked promising for the Yanks there for a second. Only two innings to go and the Sox go to the series. Found my old black suede jacket from way back today. Stopped by moms house and meandered upstairs into my storage closet. Its Diesel think it cost around 200 when I got it eight years ago. Free clothes. More reward for saving things and keeping my weight down. Time to watch the end of the game before K gets here.

 you think /i'm/ a computer geek?

 one of these days, i'll scan in a picture or two. one day soon, i promise.

 Another wonderful, albeit low-key, evening spent with the girl. Driving down the freeway to a meeting (yikes! A meeting! I introduced myself a lush!) screaming hot lyrics from Shelby Lynn infusing the mood with passionate rhythm. My hand on Kerris thigh, exchanging loving looks in between lane changes and passing cars. Such carefree fun with that woman. Carefree but not insignificant. I stare out the window at the stars and get lost in reflection. That metaphor of the distant lights like looking back in time playing with my head. Thinking of where the two of us have been, where we are now blessed for the timing. As arbitrary as the concept of time may be. I wanted to get home to write. Actually, I wanted to get home to give Kerri a chance to get good sleep without company in her bed. She has yoga in the morning, and I know how important it is to arrive prepared in every way. I dont want to be a distraction. So I kissed her sweet mouth goodnight and let myself out. Out to a neighbourhood in mourning. A young man died there last night, a drunk driving accident that turned fatal when the car the kids were in hit the curb and took out a tree on its path to a brick wall. So sad. Sobering too. Not just figuratively either. Things like that happening hurt to hear about. Calls my own behaviour into question how many times Ive driven (much more carefully than going 90 on a residential street) when I really shouldnt have. Tragic, this scene of candles and flowers and tearful high school students locked in embrace. Although by the time I left, it was already after one in the morning, so the scene was desolate. Appropriately so, I suppose. Kind of felt dead and empty, these impotent human imprints lost along a dark road in Escondido. I came home to my other love, mr.kitty. a lot of love to go around. I love that little fuzz ball. Me and K saw a movie tonight. Kind of heavy with more violence that I can really stand to see without my fingers like wooden shutters over my eyes. We saw Mystic River with Sean Penn and a whole host of other good actors. Like the lovely Laura Linney. (there I go again with my alliterations) tragic story. I dont like to hear about child molestation. It really was a quality film though. For all its flaws (it had one at the end that we agreed should have been cut from the film you could tell there was a more fleshed out story going on in the book it was taken from that wasnt fully realised in the film) no, it wasnt flawed. Perfect for its genre. See it, eh. Guys. I love her. Its not perfect, and were 16 years apart in age. But you know, she honours me. I feel good about my self in ways I havent felt in years. Or ever if you count the sullying muck that coated all that was Claudia. Shes the only other person Ive felt a deep, timeless connection to, so I have to compare them. Even though theres no comparison. Theres no mindfuck going on here. Im honestly presented and so is she. And you know, it works. Grateful am I that she lives so close to me on top of it (on the mundane level). Its way late. Im done for now.

 Nothing like scaring someone with love. Im not completely sure how I feel today. A mixed bag of angst and sadness joining forces with an uncertain heart. And of course, I feel light and breezy thinking of how nice it is to try this loving someone thing out again. As heavy as that is after everything I feel like Ive been through - when the pain comes and wipes me out. Im all over the place in my head. But then I back off the mental gymnastics of trying to wrap my brain around all the facets of the situation with Kerri. And when I do, theres nothing to distress me. Just a steady, rhythmic up and down of the universe. Im actually not worried about how this is turning out. I think of it this way: love is energy, pure and simple. Leslie taught me that much. Its there to be enjoyed, not for me to run from screaming for my life. The world is painful. Whether I participate in the risks or not, the weight of existence is crushing. Might as well give it a go when an opportunity comes to contribute to the joyous side of things. Sure, Im going to get hurt. Everyday I get hurt. The moment I step out of bed in the morning I feel pain (the physical kind too). As soon as I open my eyes Im reminded of a hundred reasons why it might be safest to stay asleep. But I get up. Because theres a fundamental decision Ive made to jump in and feel it. It may be with the help of alcohol (decided to toss that crutch aside), but Im working up to being fully present. Otherwise Id kill myself. And yes, this is a point of choosing that I come back to often. It makes more sense to me to frame it in such drastic terms. I cant sit in that third space anymore, the being helplessly depressed and not doing anything about it. The stasis of it all. That space between trying actively to destroy myself and end my life and the cowboy mentality of getting the fuck up and riding on. I need to pick one, and I have. Kerris afraid. So am I. Loving Claudia killed a part of me that Ill never get back. No, it wasnt the loving her that did it, I know. But yeah, lifes a bitch. Fellini had it right with Nights of Cabiria. But the movie is still beautiful and ultimately optimistic. Hell, maybe Ill go to a meeting today. Proclaim myself an alcoholic to a bunch of strangers. The glamour of being a depressive, alcohol-soaked writer is wearing off. Im missing my life.

 Its all beyond my scope of knowing, so I refuse attempts to encapsulate it in any systematic fashion. Love is good, no matter the grade. Ahi is still yummy on the BBQ. So what if its not sashimi grade? If you can eat it raw as it stands fresh before you, who gives a shit? That song from Queer as Folk is playing quietly in the background. Solasystim. Whatever its called. Im on my way to bed; I dont really care. An email out to the girl tonight. Banking hard on my ability to speak my heart with words. I wrote her an email after she left tonight. Knowing my limitations, gauged by my closing of one eye than accompanies the important correspondence in a pinch. I love her. To summarize. Xo C

 Im feeling the mania come on. Sure, Im watching the Cubs play and the excitement of the final innings are contagious. But more so is the happiness of finally being home alone for the first time since Friday. I cant help but feel energized. Baseball is finally exciting again! Got a cold. Hacking, barking cough that sounded bad enough to put myself on antibiotics. Glad to have some in stock in my drug drawer, the good non-penicillin type that doesnt give me hives. Eating pills on an empty stomach sucks. But eating sounds horrible. Hoping this silly sickness goes away soon. I hate that not-exactly-hungry feeling in my stomach. Im dying to see the girl. Been since what? Wednesday? Or was it Tuesday that I last saw her? I cant remember. Just that its been too long. Its lovely to want someone. But its a bit unfamiliar. I dont want to crowd her, yet I dont want her to think Im thinking of her any less than I am. Mom saw the pictures of her that appeared in my condo since she last came by. She asked who she is. So I told her, thats Kerri, an old friend of mine Ive known for years. A completely accurate statement without the details that would incite a riot. I dont live with her anymore; I can do what I want without having to explain, so why should I go out of my way to do so? Somehow I feel I should give a shot out to the folks though for providing me the space to even have this relationship. Before well, theres no way I could have had this going on. Im so blessed. For many reasons. I found out yesterday that theres a literature honours society get-together going on tomorrow at the haunted hotel downtown. Too bad I have school, or Id be there in a heartbeat. With K, Id hope, but I can never gauge whether shed be up for such things. And theyre meeting at 7. I have a class until 8 at the earliest. But still Heather H is going to be there, and I think it would be fun to see her out of a classroom setting. Bet shell bring that supercool husband of hers that Ive heard the students talk so much about. Id love to meet him. If I can swing the entrance fee. Candice forgot to pay me. Not that her word isnt good with me; she never spaces completely. But man, I gave up three whole days of my life to help her out. Its pretty inconvenient to have to wait for a check in the mail. I think maybe the night will end up being my own. I might as well hit the showers and set in for the long haul by myself. As thrilled as Id be to have a certain someones company, Im equally happy getting to let my hair down in my own private universe. I got my new pheromones in the mail today. Id ordered a new scent Id recently fallen for, Dolce and Gabbanas Light Blue. Two days after the Ebay auction closed, it appeared in my mailbox. Pretty nice. I feel like Dennis Hopper in Blue Velvet. I cant inhale enough of it to satisfy me. Well, what else am I going to do now that Ive nothing with Ks perfume on it to satiate me?

 Doing what I can to prepare for the week. Homework is minimal, but the reading load is daunting. Epic poetry is too laden with names and obscure references to mythology to keep it from going by at any reasonable pace. Then theres the middle English of Chaucer slowing me down further. Luckily I have a translation in my copy of the tales to expedite my getting it. I got a call a little while ago from K. still at work, about to finish up a 17 hour shift. Plans to see each other maybe Tuesday night, maybe not until Wednesday late. The perfumed bear she gave to me lost his scent. All the more reason for me to make sure I get to see her again soon. Shes become the bright spot to my life these past weeks. Loving and being loved freely. I miss every inch of her. I think Im going to take Trevor out to dinner tonight. If I can tear him away from the PS2. that game is fascinating, yes. But he needs to get a little homework done and still have time for a good nights rest to make up for the cold her caught late last week. Yes, we both have it. Both sound like itll be gone by tomorrow. I cant wait to feel better. I cant wait to be back in my own bed and to share it with Kerri. And to get back into my schedule of school and workouts and all the little things that make up a normal day. As lovely as it is being with the boy, I need to do my own thing to feel completely human.

 Another night of sweaty dreams, another bout with the same premise as before. The coming of apocalypse in some way and the weird time shift to where I was set back twenty years. Trying to change things already done, eh? Interesting, I suppose. Trevors still sleeping. Poor thing. The two of us up last night with nasal congestion and hacking, barking coughs until the Nyquil kicked in and left him asleep on the chair. He went out so fast, I couldnt revive him in time for the deep sleep to reach him. Couldnt get him moved into his real bed. He has basketball in a little over an hour. Im going to let him sleep. I sure knocked out hard. Only to wake in the middle of the night with an incessantly ringing phone. Itd ring twice, then hang up. Then ring five times, hang up. I figured it was one of his friends doing a prank call session, but it wasnt. I got up to pick up the receiver in the kitchen and found Candice on the other end of the line. No, there was no crisis. She just didnt want to go to sleep without hearing that were ok. Weird, but I guess I understand it. Shed left a message for Trevor on their voice mail and he never checked it. I dunno. I suppose I would have just waited until the morning if I were her. I bought him a (very) mature video game for his birthday yesterday. Grand Theft Auto Vice City. Watching him carjack people, then run them over with their own cars. Beating prostitutes with a hammer. Taking a chain saw to drug dealers to get his money back. Its all so horrible, but I know his mother wouldnt buy it for him. And now that he is 13, hes allowed exposure to this stuff without having to sneak access to it at friends houses. If he was poorly adjusted, I wouldnt have bought it. But its not like he doesnt realize its just a game. When he finally turned the game off after several hours of intense focus, he flipped the channel to The Man Show. Now, I like the show as far as stupid wastes of time go. But I couldnt help but wonder. Do you need to explain what a harness is to a young man? Or just leave it unless he asks directly? I dont have any problems telling him the truth. Id rather he ask me and get the honest answer he wants. But sheesh. Hes still a kid. Think it may be time to get some coffee started. The sunrise in these panoramic windows is so spectacular. I could just sit and soak in it. And keep with my reading of the Wife of Bath. Another borderline text for mature audiences only. No call from KerriLou last night. Weekends are tough. I miss her though. Terribly. All the more fun it will be when she gets some time off and we can spend it together.

 little miss kerri lou is fast asleep upstairs in my bed. somehow i'm way too charged up to go in with her. maybe it's the sleep i've had in the past days, maybe it's behause i know i have homework to do that i still expect to get to tonight. i bought a new TV tonight at Fry's, along with some other connections i needed. think i'll give mom the receipt and see if she can't reimburse me through the comapny. it's itemised. part of it was things any computer nerd would need. then i thought... i should have got a piece of hardware/software to make my computer a TV like it was at her house. so i suck. i didn't think it through. but i do have a new TV for pretty cheap, and i works just as well as my desktop. i only wanted to come downstairs and listen to the CD i burned, but for what ever reason it's not working on my system here. just on my laptop. but still, i'm wired awake. so maybe some time with comedy central will alieviate the buzz to stay awake. i have an extra hour tonight. and i already did my best to give my all to the girl to make sure her night asleep was as good as can be. we had a cigarette afterwards, and then i took her hands and feet into my possession and massaged shea butter into them. she nearly fell asleep at my hand, but at least i know it was well-received. i love her. i told her again tonight, but i can only hope that the timing juxtaposition made a proper impact on her. she's so wonderful, you guys. she asks me shyly as we're smoking together if she looks wrecked. with the most beautiful eyes i've ever seen on this woman. what can i say? i want to pick her up and carry her away to a place where having work the next day doesn't exist. i want to put a down payment on the space between her thighs and move in for good. i want nothing more than to take care of her. a position i know she expects no one but herself to fill. but i can. i've learned how, and i love it; so long as it's appreciated, not mired with shame. i feel none of that with her. we're on our own planet, me and her. no ties to breederdome that ruins the beauty. i care not a cent about reciprocity. all i want is to create a space where i feel her enjoying me. that's all. god bless that space. time to tune out. and eventually get sleepy enough to join her in bed before she has to wake up for work ( in 3 hours!!) Death Cab for Cutie. that's my newest acquisition. love it. so does she. go figure. fucking cat is treating the stairwell like the Indy 500. hope she can stand my house to sleep in. i know the bed is comfy, but this f-ing cat...

 Another night session with my best friend, me. The game is over and with it the series. Got a fresh pack of cigs and my laptop still perking away at low battery. The phone with me in case the girl calls me, but theres a question to whether that will happen this evening with her work session interfering. She texted me, but I dont know what the situation really is. So I left Mr. Kitty at home to play with himself and the toys I threw out for him. Glad that Paula and Pete approve of his stellar coolness. They came on over this afternoon to see the place and go to lunch to the new place down the road, Grappa in San Marcos. I think the San Marcos dining scene has finally been redeemed. Well see how crowded that place ends up being. God knows Im singing its praises after just the first time visiting. Prices are quite reasonable, the fare quite interesting if not middle of the road in terms of adventure. But its good. And its close enough that I could walk there with no problem. It was good to see them. I just think the world of those two. Id love to travel the world with them. Theyre talking about another trip to Zimbabwe. Id love to go with, but theres no way I could get away at this point. the cat could get along fine without me so long as I get someone to come by to love him each day. Hm. Plans in the back of my mind for when Im in a financial capacity to follow through with those kinds of dreams. I wrote to Leslie today in response to her questions about whats new and what ever turned out from my last (Natalie) therapy thwarting. So I spilled the latest, about Kerri, about school and the new place. And telling her too about the cast-off I got from the schools psychological services. Im doing well, so I communicated as much to her. Glad I dont have any crises to relate these days. The worst I can point to is my failure (so far) to earn another series of straight-As. And I also wrote to Matt, my good new friend from my literature classes. He had some advice questions about his pursuits in the world of personal-ad dating. So I dished my advice, added to my own exposition of the me-and-Kerri confusions. Its nice and appropriate to give back a little tit-for-tat personal information to the tales I hear from him. I like that boy. When I met him, I always thought to myself, What a nice guy. I bet hes married. A girl would be crazy not to take him on. Yet things arent that easy for him, too bad. Were workout buddies now, or so it seems without enough repeat episodes to call it a regular thing. I appreciate that he asks my advice without even knowing my own history with dating. I cant even call it dating when Ive done what Ive done in relationships. I won another auction from someone in France on Ebay today. A movie poster from La Pianiste that I love tremendously. I bought the film on recommendation before Id even seen it, bought it on DVD from someone in Hong Kong before it came out in a region 1 area. So it cost a bit, but thats only because its being shipped from the continent. I got that one along with two others; Amelie (but a cool, B-version of the poster with her face over her caf), and I also got a vintage print of Woodys Manhattan. All were reasonable in price. Whats going to get me is the cost in framing them. Not that Id go to Aaron Bros. or anything. But even for something cheap, its going to cost twice as much as the articles themselves. All the better for the houses decorating. Ive got more blank white wall than God. Or better yet, than my parents places in Encinitas and Julian. They dont get the art factor. And too, it costs a lot to get stuff up there. Luckily for me, I worship films, and those are cheaper to erect shrines to than are famous artists. Or even marginally successful artists. Pete and Paula got me new cutting boards for a housewarming. Cool! The ones I have are either plastic or falling apart. Having two new wood ones helps in a big way. If only I was cooking more theres so many things I want to do with this kitchen. I spoke last night with Luis and Ms. Robin Truelove. We decided we want to do something for Thanksgiving at my place this year. And yes, I have the means to have it an all-inclusive vacation. That extra bedroom to let them crash over at my place and not have to drive home. It goes a long way when you cook and eat and drink like we do; its an all night affair. So Ill do again my signature appetiser of scallops seared with crme fraiche and scallions and caviar. Maybe this year Ill get another bottle of Veueve Clicquot. Maybe even a better bottle than the yellow label. When Bryan gets back into town, I know hell agree to join forces with our celebration. Too bad for him hell actually have to drive more than a mile to engage in social activity. But he loves to cook, for people even more. Ill let him do the meat and the dessert. Ill do an appetiser and some wine and a mache salad. My usual. Dont tell me Im slipping into Chris Kueffner complacency. Im not cooking enough to have a new arsenal of recipes. The laptops battery is threatening to die now, so Id better cut this off. This is usually my venue to write when I know I wont be posting it to the blog. But tonights I think I might upload it after all. And if Frys is still open, I have some cable connections I ought to pay for and get set up at the joint. A new co-ax and a new super long phone cable for the laptop/ second desk set-up computer. The old monitor hooks up to the laptop, so will the keyboard once I get a new cordless from Chris. And I have a cool cordless mouse for it already. Itll just be a good secondary site. Always nice to have options. Or at least have it look fully functional. Its all about appearances.

 Oh lord, can I stand to wait until this Ebay acquisition makes it to my door?! I just own a La Pianiste poster from France. Id sell pints of my blood to afford a decent frame for it. Just paid for it; it should ship on Monday. I think Im going to go out and watch the end of the Series at a pub. Get the community effect of loving sports. I have no plans tonight since I spent the afternoon reading instead of sleeping. And taking a bath with the radio on. I ate like a machine the last two days. Ill have to hit the gym pretty hard tomorrow. And read, read away to pull off a passing grade in Haytons class with the big ol midterm on Monday. Josh Beckett. Who knew? This kid is fantastico. But not as cute as Cabrera. What a game. Im out of here.

 You know, its got to be the medication. I sat down on the big chair to do my reading when I was suddenly and without warning seized with exhaustion. I slinked upstairs and fell asleep in my bed with all my clothes on, staying there for three hours. Now, I got enough sleep last night. I even took a nap yesterday for two hours or more. Id had plenty of coffee and no alcohol yesterday to tire me. So what gives? Respirdal and Elavil, I guess. I guess because I took a break from taking both, its now working as if I just started it. Im well on my way to finishing the Iliad, the first book of my exam prep. Well, of the two books I didnt finish. Gilgamesh I have a handle on. I wonder what the test is going to look like. Glad I still have the weekend to study everything. And to go over examples of comitatus, pietas, and hospitality surely the topic of essays. I got word from Kerri that shes feeling a need to back up and take another look at our friendship. I got a sense of it last night with all this talk about loss and death, crises in general that I dont know how to respond to outside of just listening. And too, I felt like I was clawing my way into her clothes the last two times we spent the night together. Not so much feeling rejected as I did awkward. So when we got into bed, I decided just to go to sleep. She bolted out of bed this morning at seven. Dressed and bound to a coffee cup before I could even roll over and groan, I almost expected her to kiss my forehead and leave asap. It was only later this morning when I read her blog that I had any clear sense of what that was all about. Not the best communicative avenue to utilize, but I suppose Im the greatest offender in that respect. I have to admit, I was little confused. I know we live in different worlds. We come from vastly different backgrounds, our age disparity is huge, our interests dont often coincide. She doesnt even eat, let alone drink. Theres not a lot that I do regularly (go out to fun restaurants, hit a party, cook for friends, talk about literature) that we can share. Movies are right on, but theres not a lot of connecting that can happen in silence. Well, fuck it. I adore her, but the limitations are plainly visible. As they have been all along. Maybe shes right to take a step or two back. Maybe we ought not sleep together anymore. Maybe this is the opportunity Ive been hoping for to reinvest all of myself into my studies to pull out those As after all. I wish I could talk to her about school at least, but even that isnt the point. Im voting for a hands-off approach. Shes the one backing up, so Ive got to let her make the next move. As for tonight, I aim to get pissed drunk. Because I can, and because I want to. Read into that as much as you like. And no, I have no friends with whom I can bounce this off of. Thats why I blog, mes chres.

 i suppose i can sleep later on. i have a meeting with the student org council in a few... but the real reason i got up so early is on account of Kerri not being able to sleep in. i fell asleep too quickly last night, then woke up just as sleepy. sad because i didn't capitalise on the time i had with her. just hung out all sleepy. and talked a lot - that's sweet. still, i don't see her all that often. got lots of homework to do this weekend in prep for an exam on monday, so it's just as well i get up and get going with the day. seems likely that i'll get a C on this test anyway i look at it, but i have to give it a go and shoot for higher just for the sake of principle.

 Want to know the temperature in Bolzano? Uh-hem. Its a toasty 34 with rain and snow forecasted for the night. Want to travel with me? Actually, Id appreciate a respite from the heat. Its still 92 out here with no a/c. So I went shopping today. Just a few things bagged up, but the trip itself turned out wildly successful everywhere I went had to put so many things back with a sideways glance, sure to come back for it. My shutterfly pictures came in the mail today too, so I spent a few minutes putting them up and flipping through my Barbados memories. The walls are looking a lot less naked. Three or four film posters on their way too that Ill have to find frames for. Maybe only putting up one a week so it doesnt bankrupt me. I love getting stuff done to this place. Its /almost/ done. Shits. I think Id be better off taking a nap this afternoon than doing this stupid blogging. Or eat. You know, take care of things so Im awake and energized for the night to come. Annie Lennox on Ellen tomorrow. Hm.

 more meds, a little shopping at nord's, back home to clean house and knock through some heafty reading necessary to pass a midterm on monday. maybe a blog session when i get some of that done. until then, enjoy the sprung rhyme: As kingfishers catch fire, dragonflies draw flame; As tumbled over rim and roundy wells Stones ring; like each tucked string tells, each hung bell's Bow swung finds tongue to fling out broad its name; Each mortal thing does one thing and the same: Deals out that being indoors each one dwells; Selves- goes itself; myself it speaks and spells, Crying What I do is me: for that I came. I say more: the just man justices; Keeps grce: tht keeps all his goings graces; Acts in God's eye what in God's eye he is-- Chrst. For Christ plays in ten thousand places, Lovely in limbs, and lovely in eyes not his To the Father through the features of men's faces. Hopkins, 1882

 What a day, what a day. Yes, I awoke on time to get to class with my usual 30 minute buffer for proper parking options. Then to class where I took my first ever Hayton midterm. And you know what? I think it went really well. Not only did I pass it, I think I got a mid to high B. which is saying something for her classes, yo. Were all afraid of her exams. And tonight I got back a paper written for my 309B class. American Lit, late. Not a stellar performance at an 89%, but itll do for a paper I waited until the last weekend to write and never read through before submission. Ill kill the next paper, and theres only two more to consider. So I went to all my classes tonight and even spoke up on a pressing comment I had to make on Edna Pontellier in Chopins The Awakening. A text Ive read, what? Like four times now in my literary education? Im sick of it. Sick of the themes, talking about the ending, listening to peoples judgment of her character (or lack of). S-i-c-k. but I stuck it out until the bitter end while my colleagues whove taken the early US lit class with me this summer WHERE WE JUST READ IT were walking out bored. And what do I come home to? Some time with the XBOX playing RoadRage until I realized there was a World Series match on. Tuned in just in time to see the Marlins win in the 12th. Now Im happy. Tied at 2 a piece. I feel like going out. But wheres Kerri? I thought she might come by tonight, but now Im assuming shes going to call on her way to bed. So Im going out to the Lane for a brew and some time alone. I need no, I deserve some downtime. I did good today, god damn it. I passed a Hayton exam.

 cat action sequence:

 Ma lord, its so damn hot out here today. Weatherbug alerted me when it topped 100, kept going to 102. Now I see a fire on the not-so-distant horizon. Not surprised with the weather being so dry, so unrelentingly hot. I bought new toys for the stupid cat while at Walmart getting him more poop powder. I think I did irreparable damage to my back picking up that 28lb bucket and carrying it to my car. Somehow the thought of a cart at that store seemed ridiculous. Too much crap. The cats beside himself. Anything with feathers. Hes pretending like hes some jungle cat with a fresh kill, staring at it with an open mouth. But while I was in there shopping, I hear the PA system come on. Attention associates. We have a fire in the toy department. Curious looks exchanged between customers. One employee shouts out, does that mean we have to leave the store? whatever it was, I was right next to that department, and I didnt see anything. Maybe it was my smokin bod setting off the fire alarm again. I ought to be studying summore for my early british lit midterm for Haytons class. I reread Canterbury Tales and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight this afternoon. Now onto rereading Beowulf, the Lais of Marie de France, and the Battle of Maldon. And any others I may be forgetting. Its looking like its going to be one hell of a test. And bright and early in the morning to take it. I should try to remember to invoke the muses before my coffee tomorrow.

 Coming in a bit late tonight. I thought for sure Id be in for several hours of patio blogging, but it seems the bar here at Penny Lane. I just got here, and yes its after 11. but Ive been a good girl so far tonight. I thought Id have plenty of time to hammer away, but it seems this town, along with me, shut down around midnight. I think I would have too, but there was a call in to Kerri that kept me up past my exhaustion point. I passed it a couple of times today. The site where a colleague of mine killed himself on a stop light this weekend. And unlike the one by kerris house, this one is adorned with nothing more than a police no entry tape. Is it somehow less tragic when its a cocllege kid that bites the dust? I know the scene disturbed me, made me think twice about going out at night. Not for my own impairment as much as that of the folks that now live near me. But still a boy died here. Does anyone care? I do. Should I create a shrine on my own? The girl called me this evening as she was coming home. Plans to play on Thursday night well past my midterm deadline. Thats tomorrows project; to study and reread everything from our class so far. Im afraid of this class I know I wont make the A cut-off Ive established as a requirement for myself in the past few semesters. Hayton is too demanding. And w/o graduate school in the forecast, who gives a shit as long as I pass the class? But the real question is this: is my relationship, whatever that means/ can be defined to be, interfering negatively with my studies? I know, I dont see her during the week. But Im thinking about her. That alone is more energy gone than Im used to. Its good energy but the grades Ive pulled off are largely characterised with a lack of other directions to throw my energy. Ive no experience in the integration. You all remember me at SDSU. Kicked out. Because the Claudia thing was so intense, I freaked out and left town for my finals. I had no investment then. I sure do now. Im almost done. And although I realise I have more crazily drawn expectations than most, I do see a slippage happening or poising to happen. I dont want that. Itd be one thing if I thought the two of us could be together forever. What is forever? just a straight-world construct that expects families with children to endure the hardships of falling out of love for the sake of their children. This is definitely not that. But Id like to think this is something thats going to last; at least for longer than the relationships Ive had in the past. Theres no goal here. No expectation of where its supposed to evolve towards. Or to change at all. It just is, and its perfect in its own right. Im allowed a respite from my hang-ups. Im allowed a safe place to love a very worthy recipient. And Im allowed some pretty passionate love in return. Where else could I get this? More than that, how often can any of you say that youve someone in your life who cares that much about you? She does. I know it. Maybe not like a life-commitment partner, but that would be out of step with me if it were true. What do I know that happens beyond a semesters worth of time? The boys in the bar want to know what Im writing. As usual. Anyone still at a bar this late on a Monday night is probably beyond converting. The word blog meant nothing to them. A bit tempted to have them look me up, but I think Ive learned to know better. My email address is linked up to it. The mu-zak was just playing the into to a Pink Floyd song from the Wish You Were Here album, but the bartender cut it off. Too bad, cause now Im wishing I still owned the thing. Now its our local hero, oh shoot whats his name? From the Eagles. He lives here. Not Glenn I cant remember anyone else. Henley? Yeah Ok, well I could ask his name to be sure, but I think the inquiry would open me up to too much Q and A. Might be time to cruise home. I feel like I need this night to get all out-of my-head with drinking since I have limits on it now with my time with Kerri. Meaning, I want passionately to reign in the impulse control for the nights Im with her. And shoot, its no problem when I know Im going to see her. The promise of her company is way more weighted than the want for distraction. I think shes about the only one I can think of that Id go out of my way to be present for. I mean, I love you all. But shes like I couldnt bear it if I was less that 100% with her when shes with me. She has such a potency on her own that I couldnt manage a substitute without lamenting the gap. This woman is as much if not more intense than I am. And yo, thats saying something, yes?

 i'm buying images online for framing. thought i'd post these from the digi: AND HUMPER-CAT:

 This is what Ive been waiting for since I moved in. Im sitting here watching the last colours of day fade out on the horizon from my bedroom window. I had a big day of being productive and now have little more to do than sit still and relax. And blog. I feel like Im not giving this the energy I sometimes do, as Id hope to. A long, hard workout at the gym after class with Matt, a man from my classes. I like him a good guy who deserves better luck with women than the universe is offering. Weve bonded a bit over the past few months, finding common ground with our affinity for exercise. Hes an ex-triathlete, me an ex-13miler. But we still love to workout, still have egos to keep the fire fueled into our retirement. He didnt stay too long since hed already done most of his routine earlier in the day, but I got most of my arms and abs done with him. Then to zone out alone on the cardio equipment with my Outkast CDs. I left a sweaty mess, and it felt great. I still want to do some push-ups, to hell with my already-sore arms. Time to sink into project land. And to eat something since Ive kind of skipped that all day for what ever reason.

 Finally!! Im sitting in my favourite black leather chair in front of a couple of open windows pondering my navel and getting my fill of fucking around on my new computer. I know I should have called it a night long ago, but the buzz of projects is keeping me wired. I cant think of ending this playtime so early. I have class tomorrow. I have class, and I know I need to go. The only thing is I dont think Heather is going to be there to teach us tomorrow. She has to give a deposition, something I know all too well about. So I think Im in the clear until later on, but its my goal to get up and show up for it anyway. Printing out pictures somehow saved by Chris. Old photos Ive taken along with another pile of pictures with friends. Makes me wish I had a better printer. Which is something Im seriously considering. Especially now that my brother gave me his old digital camera. Why he got a new one, god only knows. This works wonderfully, and Ive already taken a picture or two of the workspace he constructed for me tonight. Pretty cool, eh? He bought me a brand new desk from Office Depot on his way up here with mom. Black and brown to match my chair and the impromptu table I put together earlier today. Aside from the wine boxes as furniture, the place looks super done up. Ive even got the old desk in the other bedroom, and it fits perfectly. I could just sit here for hours and play around. Ill do so until the sleeping pills Ive been prescribed kick in. theyre just downer anti-depressants, but they do the job when Im feeling all cracked out with energy. Sucks not to be able just to shut it out on my own. I love feeling this energetic surge; it just doesnt help when I have things to do early in the morning. So I thought I should write about this, but so far Ive pushed it away, back-burner style. I told you all that I went to see someone for psychological help last week. Someone at school through the universitys counseling network. Now that Im s-o-l with therapists for the money reason, I thought Id be a trooper and try once again to connect myself. Well, guess what I was told after being interviewd? It seems I have a lot of big problems that they cant help me with. And itd be best for me to seek long-term care rather than challenge these folks to help me. Turned away again. So I think its best I do what they say, although it sure isnt a pat on the back knowing they too think Im too much to take on. You know, Im not that crazy when you think about it. Sure, when my psyches capacity for tumult reaches critical mass, Ive been known to do wildly impulsive things that complicate more than they deliver relief. But throw me a bone; I need anything I can get, not another boot in the butt.

 This may be the last time I have to blog standing up. Im plenty tired of life without my desktop, but Chris is bringing over the new and improved system to me tonight. I cant wait to get set up. Theres something about my little space before a window with my real computer. Watching football, trying to upload some more images to Shutterfly to order prints. Some promotion to get 15 free 4x6s. these walls are naked. I need to decorate. Actually, I need to just relax on the house thing. Its too distracting always feeling compelled to clean more, to tinker with things. Its good enough, and I have homework to do. Had a good night hanging out with Kegler last night. Went to dinner, then to Frys for a CD and he a movie. We came back here and listened to the new Outkast that Id been waiting patiently to acquire. Pretty good for that kind of thing, Id say. More to listen to in the gym while working out. Id be at the gym now, but I dont feel like leaving the house. Been craving a calm day alone at home for weeks now, and I think today will be the day that happens. Doing my situps and pushups before the telly, trying to get my arms and abs to peak condition. I see that damned picture of me at 21 when I was still running, before I hurt my back. Its destined to be that one picture I keep for when Im older and Im feeling the need to justify my athletic past with evidence. Wont ever be looking that good in my lifetime, I fear. Another young man died yesterday. Another head-on traffic accident with drugs and alcohol taking the life of a teenager. He drove into a traffic light post. Ran a red light and just smashed right into it. Right in the middle of the day, broad daylight. I saw it right after it happened. Fire trucks and ambulances, cops roping off the scene. The whole cab of the pickup was wrapped around the pole. Instant death. 18 year-old boy. No skid marks. Just hit it. A witness told me he had pills in his pocket. E? how else could you be that out of it? Tragic. If Id left the house five minutes earlier, I might have been involved. Or even been there to watch it happen. Horrible shit, this irresponsible testosterone-fuelled behaviour. Yesterday I was sad, but right now Im feeling more angry about it. I think it may be best to get off of this thing and get to my reading so I dont feel so behind during the week. Big exam day with Hayton on Wednesday that I dont know how Im going to manage. Best get to it. Its my own fault if I dont get a good grade.

 My baby doll is going through stuff, and I cant do a thing to fix it. Damn those real world problems! I want my girl to feel good!! And I want to be her friend when anything more seems ridiculously uncalled for. What else can I do but be there for her? I know well the times when I shut down for reasons beyond rationality. I guess Im just used to it only being me who does that. Im honoured to be on the other side of it. Gathering an appreciation for those who love me despite myself. A phrase I brought to the table with Kerri tonight. Probably killed the impact by deconstructing the verbiage in front of her, the choice of the word despite instead of in spite of. Nothing like the brain to kill the emotional poignancy. Shes distant. I adore her so much. And I think (I think) I can see her well enough to see through the behaviour and into the deeper workings of her mind. But how am I to know? I was raised with a woman who had me play games with assuming her background and baggage. Relationships entail empathy. And I havent lost that. I just hope she gets that. I understand more than I communicate. After all Ive been through, I can interpret and appreciate a lot. How do you communicate that? She read my blog from the other day. The one where I spoke about the hard time I had with her turning me away. To talk about it hurt, so I avoided it. But she persisted, clearing up what she thought was an ambiguous space lying between us. But the thing is, I get it. I just didnt want to talk about it. I suppose thats my baggage. Im a little less enthusiastic when it comes to dealing with things head-on. I shrank. I was afraid I wasnt being perceived accurately. I tried to explain my way out of something she already understood. Sounds to anyone whos listening, the two of us are going through the same things. Shes got some time off in the coming days, but Im not too expectant that Ill get to see much of her. Which is fine, but I love being with her. I love telling her about how I feel when Im with her. It doesnt wreck my life to go without, but when someone asks Im sure as hell going to tell them when I feel so fabulous in their presence! Shes a doll. Such a unique soul. Such a passionate person, full of life and sensitivity. Theres never been anyone like this woman in all my dealings. I try to tell her how incredible she is, how individuated her worth. But tell that to anyone, and they balk at the expression. I just want her to feel for herself of what I feel about her. Turn the tables, and Im not sure what would happen. People before her, however, have filled the space that my sickeningly depraved sense of self has left open. I understand. Im grateful for the lovin I get from people who see me better than I do. Its creepy. I havent eaten a goddamned thing all day. Id better go augment my blunder with a trip to my local burrito joint. Adieu. And if this is Kerri reading my blog I love you, sweet thing. Youre a /doe/ is sheeps clothing.

 Happy Halloween, everyone. no, i'm not dressing up this year. i'd thought about it, but between the cost of a costume and the organisation of a party i thought better. i've had enough fright for one week, thanks. i'm just now realising that it's friday, and with that comes a new week in just a couple of days wherein i have plenty to have prepared. school being cancelled for a week was welcomed, but getting back into it is not happening too easily. a paper to write for wednesday, an awful exam for monday... and all the usual reading assignments piling up. at least i'm doubling back on other works i've already studied. i've simply got to spend some time with Aeneas this weekend. i'm afraid the rest of the class spent this time boning up on the books whereas i have don't little outside of mope, cry, and watch with worried mind the television coverage. maybe i'll give myself a break and write about the ending to Chopin's The Awakening and keep it simple. talk about setting as psychological space, that kind of thing. no reinvention of the wheel here, just a solid A- kind of paper. i feel like shopping. maybe i'll call mom and see if she's up for going with me. then... then i'll hit the books.

 Over 420 hits on the blogsite this month. Amazing. I did a bunch of writing the past couple of nights, but I decided to hold onto it as my own. Instead of committing my usual blunder of publishing things too personal for public consumption. So thats my excuse for not publishing enough lately. Oh boy, its the South Park episode where the goldfish stalks Stan. Just like my cat. I shut my eyes, and the cats looking at me when I open them. When I open them again, its closer, staring. I wanted to go over to Bryans tonight to play with his scanner, but I suddenly feel like Im too worn out to walk downstairs. Something with my sinuses. Best sign off. Sleep is good.

 More sadness on yet another front. The fires? Well, Ill get to that. Its complicated. Itll preface it with that. Tonight I felt the old pain well up in my chest, throat, arms, and hands. K said something that caused my little heart to stop, my verbal ability clammed up. I was sitting on top of her, kissing on her stomach. She said something to the effect that I was all over her or something the gist in my little head is that I was being asked to back off. I dont really remember the context; just that the sense of rejection was sharp, pointed. And reminded me of Claudia. All those hours playfully lying with each other, me and Claudia would engage in this non-stop push and pull of how close shed allow me to be. Being pushed away, thats what I remember most. So when I saw it happening again, I hurt. It hurt really bad, you guys. And like anything that rips into me like that, I went immediately in my mind to things that could make it stop. And that lead me to those inevitable thoughts: What am I getting myself into? Did my heart sign me up for something it cant truly backup? Is this another repeat adventure of loving someone too distant to reciprocate? But no. thats not where it all ended up. It wasnt easy to sit with it, the remembrance like Prousts Madeline. But seeing my baby hurting. The crux of the matter being her propensity for shutting down when I indulge in that honey-sweet intensity. I scare her. It breaks my heart to know my love is causing someone pain. But we talked about it. I got to hold her darling head to my chest and wipe some tears away. I got whispered words into her tiny little ears. I got to connect with her. So honored am I that she let me in. Yet I let her go. To get some sleep in her own bed and possibly to let out a better cry once shes all alone. I love her. I hope she can feel this, even if it is only a little at a time. Its all any of us can. Dont be embarrassed that you feel these things, Kerri. Celebrate your courage. Its going to be ok. Do you know what a wonderful miracle it is that we're feeling this together? Do you know how incredible I feel sharing my bed with you? All the things too intimate to talk about on a public blog? It's what makes life matter, this stuff. It may have its flaws, but it's worth a shot to explore. It's worth the pain and fear to jump in and test the currents. worse comes to worse, at least it's a beautiful view once you're sucked out to sea. When Im with Kerri, Im relaxed. Im calm, Im within myself. I know pain is part of it, and Im alright trusting the larger forces at work. Two passionately feeling people coming out of long spells of emotional hibernation. Whatever happens, weve already gained so much from this. As long as we can communicate and continue to be honest with our feelings when they come up. Tonight wasnt easy, but it felt good to be able to tell her outright that it felt like back when I was with Claudia. What I didnt get into is how it felt like being with her. It made me feel shameful for wanting to be amourous with anyone, for having desire, for expressing my love for someone with my hands instead of just my words. It made sex such an issue of control that I /never/ had the wheel to steer. Its made me passive. I used to not be this way. And now when Im not, Im reminded of why theres the risk of denial. And that denial carries a heavy weight of shame as its companion. The permission has to be explicitly given. And in a situation where defining a relationship is a sticky wicket yes, the hurt is inevitable. And guess whos got their uniform are pressed and ready for tomorrows rematch? Im so not running off. Nor am I charging in without taking heed of the signs to slow. Our thing is on its own trajectory upward. I think of it as its own living entity, shaping and growing outside of my reach of overt manipulation. So like, its out of my hands. Save for my part in it. My behaviour. My respectfulness of Kerris past and present hurt. God, I love her. Whatever that means. Remember the video game, Paperboy? I miss that game. If anyone can find me a PC version, let me know. And again, Wanda Sykes is radical. Buy that girl a drink! Time to wind down.

 yellow dog becomes red dog in the whacked light.

 The light outside is surreal. I have my windows shut to keep out the loud stench of a burning county. Watching falling ashes like the first snow of the season. I just walked outside for a minute to capture the images with the camera. The most stunning feature of this morning is the absolute silence. No one is out. Not a creature stirring. At least not where Im at. Looks like a day for laying low and watching movies. No stores open. Nothing I really want to do outside of watching the tube for updates, but I know that can create a burnout feeling after a while. Im doing my part by not taking a shower again today. Saving water so long as I dont see anyone today. Three full days of gathering a stink isnt sociable. Skipping the vacuuming, the dishes, the laundry. What else can I do? Paint my nails and sit still.

 here's some pictures from the neighbourhood. it's hard to see how orange the light is outside, but at least you can gather how bad it is even this far away from the epicenter. pete and paula were evacuated last night. prayers that their home is ok today.

 This is such a terrible day. Three fires from Escondido to the border seems to have converged in at least this mind as one big front. I just received word from my prof, Martha, that the school will more than likely be closed tomorrow. I mourn for lost lives. Strangely, Im more concerned with the furry little animals and frogs and such that have surely perished. Poway is being evacuated now. The fire went north into that neighborhood. So many people living out there. I want to cast out an offering to let someone from these places to come to my house to sleep. So many people displaced. So I offered to Kerri and her mom. They can see the fire from their house, soon (I think) to be evacuated. I just want to help; I cant stand thinking Im helpless and with that the folks I love. Its getting brighter, and Im eagerly insisting they come on over. Ill even go over there and lend my car to their packing. I just want to help. I wonder how all my other loves are doing. All these other friends of mine in the county that stand in the line of the fire. Dozens. I need to eat something to keep awake. Hopefully it wont put me to sleep. If it does, god knows Ill have the phone on next to my pillow.

 Atmospheric disturbance evident in the manic twinkling of lights in the darkened distance. The fires continue to rage. Now hearing from neighbors that they can see the flames from the hill. San Pascual Valley now evacuated, nearly ten miles from my house. The front that Im worried about is encroaching on Escondido from Valley Center just a few miles north of there and maybe ten more miles from here. No signs of respite. No signs of the troublesome weather pattern breaking its hold on the high pressure system. My eyes burn from tears and smoke. The windows shut all day, my chest still feels tight and painful. My cold gathered speed in the night with the bedroom windows wide letting the early hours of the fires get in. Car looks like it drove through a nuclear winter. Ashes in dingy light. Window sills covered in white soot. Hayton cancelled our classes and our midterm for tomorrow. Guess I wasnt the only one who emailed her in a panic over family and personal safety. So to squander the night, Im gathering momentum with an open beer and a CD bought last night. Id call to find out what Kerris up to, but I was a little weirded out with her this morning. Amidst the terror of having my parents stuck in mortal danger, she didnt react with the concern I needed. Kind of blew it off as overly dramatic or just another day in the life. Not that shes uncaring; thats just it. It was uncharacteristically casual of her to skip right on from my parents trapped in a fire to mundane things like the logistics of being close enough to take pictures of the flames. I dont know. I guess its not easy to listen to someone in a pinch like I felt I was early this morning. Still, I hoped for a little softness and compassion. It wasnt like I was crying to her on the phone. Back to my Death Cab for Cutie CD. Fuck it all. Theres more to worry about than property damage and less-than-stellar friends. Things like mortality of people I love loom in the balance tonight. And to that, I raise a glass with a nod of respect to powers much greater than my little world.

 urlLink fire A picture from my brother's backyard in Mira Mesa. Julian is gone. Burned. Parents got out this morning after witnessing the loss. The houses and structures are saved, but everything else is gone. Thank god they're alive.

 A bit hard to see uot here, but writing seems a better waste of time than a whole lot of other things. Hand are shaking today from the days drinking behind me. I cant remember having such a case of them. I feel like everyone is watching me. This defined paranoia that comes with such a profound hangover. My face is a mess from picking at it and from poor health. Smoking and drinking, eating only because I have to. Going out for dinner with Pete and Paula in a couple of hours. Hopefully a couple of drinks and some fresh air out of the house will set me straight before I have to be social. Man, I dont have to go out with them. I want to though. Its good for me to get out. They dont care if I have the shakes. They already know theres reason for concern. Driving down here to Shakespeares was the first time Id seen first hand the devastation of the fires. All up and down the 15 and 163 from Mira Mesa to the 805 intersection is levelled. Looks so deadened. Paralleling how Im feeling, I suppose. Its wild the way fire can destroy things. It looks so creepy. Empty and lifeless. Seeing this site before me almost caused me to pull over and cry. It hit my gut like a lead weight, choking up my throat. Geez, things have gotten bad. I cant remember ever feeling this lost or hopeless. Although god knows I have before, and worse. Way worse. The month after I left Claudia was maybe the most pain and the hardest struggle of my life. The weekend Kerri disappeared was hard too, but that had a lot to do with meth and the spoils of coming down. Same with that time I found out my girlfriend slept with my best friend on the night I threw her a birthday party. I had been up for two days already. I didnt know what to do, I was so enraged and defeated. This whole week has been quite a struggle. I dont know how to anticipate the night out Im about to have. Im so not doing well, yet Im not sure how to be with that and still be social. I know, I know I can be whatever I want, and they still love me. I keep thinking about Cliff, my dead uncle. I feel so close to him even though I hardly knew him. Shot himself in the head on Christmas eve. Girlfriend left him, and he collapsed for the last time. So sad, and yet so understandable. Im in a way grateful I didnt have a relationship with him. So that I dont know how close the two of us are. I have everything to live for. Im not suicidal. But I am feeling a bit hopeless seeing things from this place. I understand I have a couple of diseases working against me. Alcoholism, depression, mental instability. My moms dad drank himself to death. A lot of us arent that happy, but we manage. And I will too. It just sucks to feel this much when it all seems to hurt me at once. Id almost forgotten how this all unravelled. It started with the fires. Thinking my parents were going to be killed, trapped in it while it swept through their house. That morning I awoke to Kerri leaving my bed, then calling less than an hour later to tell me the hillsides were on fire. It seemed everything was in harms way. In a mortal-danger kind of way. I got up and fixed mommy a drinkie and went back to bed, feeling helpless and defeated at my lack of agency. Then mom called and woke me up again to tell me theyre trapped. She was crying and so scared. My whole world was shaken. If I lost my parents now And then Paulas house was threatened. Her whole neighbourhood burned to the ground except for a couple of places. Their lives werent in danger, but the sense of loss compounded on itself nonetheless. It was the fires, those days of worry and hurt, that sparked all of this. It shook me good. I grieved the loss and the prospect of losing too much. It fucked me up. I still cant imagine going back up to Julian until the green comes back. Until things stop smoking. My spiritual center is that place. And those who live there. That was too much to be at stake all at once. And then Kerri left. True, I wasnt doing too well right before that happened. But when I lost her, my big sunny bright spot on my life. Jesus, who wouldnt be depressed and hurting? And I cursed myself for not being stronger. For not dealing with my losses in a different way. Maybe her coping is to vanish when things get intense. Maybe I should look at both sides of it more. I need to learn to give myself a break instead of turning it all on myself. Cutting. I woke up the other morning and went through my day for hours before I noticed Id done it again. Ive done it a lot lately, and it seems like I dont want to stop it. Its the same thing as any crutch. Theres a reliable outcome that distracts me from what hurts a lot more. I take my grief more seriously when I can see it like that. Its like a signal to myself, reminding me its getting worse than I can manage. Im so disappointed for being dumped during this time. I dont ever allow myself to rely on someone for support. And then I do, and I get left standing on the curb in tears. I understand why she left. I just dont understand why this got started when she knew I was a mess and coping terribly with alcohol. I dont try to hide my feelings. I cant do it very well even if I tried. She saw me drunk at Pride. She saw me drunk all the time. She said my beer breath was sexy and kept kissing me. She kept saying it didnt matter, and I almost believed her however guilty I felt for corrupting her environment in which to stay clean. But if I was thinking instead of just revelling in the chance to be loved, I would have seen this coming from the very beginning and tried not to get attached. I got attached. I fucking fell in love with her. It didnt take long after those years together when we were younger. I was already half-way there when I was a teenager. Sometimes I think I had to do some writing the other day for therapy about what I get out of my relationships that fail me so. Am I really trying all over again to reinforce the model my mother set for me? That love is unavailable, and all you can do is sit by and watch love disappear into themselves? All those years as a kid wanting attention and being punished for the way I sought it while mom remained removed from the world. Am I recreating that pain with women who tell me outright that theyre not available? The very foundation of my attraction to these women I mean well, but Im barking up the wrong tree. Kerri cant be in my life the way I want her to be. I know that. But I love her just the same. Why all the self-punishment? Why dont I fall in love with someone who wants to be with me and can? I know, its hard to find someone to love. Period. But these episodes are killing me. Literally, I dont know how much more painful experiences I can chalk up to my history before I shut down harder than this. And who knows what that will look like? Im afraid. Truly, truly afraid that Ive created a universe with its own laws and order that I cant escape from. Heres me, and heres my capacity to feel. And heres what will always happen. It daunting to look into the future with the awareness I have. Kerri will never love me the way I need. Not unless some miracle happens and she becomes more available. But thats not the point. kerri now is out of my league. Shes beyond my hearts grasp, so to speak, and its being in this place that scares me. I dont know what Im doing. Sure, going to school and graduating in Spring sounds lovely. Its my prescribed path that Ive honoured and am fulfilling. But then what? Get a job and live alone and be alone. Ok, so I can do that. I have to do that. But whats the value in it? I want more than anything to be in a relationship that honours me. Me! I want to stop seeing myself as wrong and unnatural and dangerous. I dont want to be the girl who only dates women outside of my age-range. I dont want to be the kid that operates solely from her distorted past experiences. I dont want to see myself as a mess anymore. But I really dont think Im going to break free of this self-conception. Its hard to imagine, and therefore impossible to achieve. All the therapy in the world cant help it. Cant fix it I may feel better in the short term operating with that illusion that Im working at it and therefore suspending my disbelief. Its like, if I keep going to talk to people, I can still attach to the fantasy that theres progress to be made. Maybe its this false hope that I need to invest in. Like I told Heather the other day, you people dont get it. I cant be helped. Ive tried for ten years to do something about how bad I feel. Theres no relief, and theres no cure. It just is, and I need only to get better at managing the fall-out from my reality. Thats as good as it gets. Youre dealt a set of cards, and thats the way of it. Get over a losing hand and learn to look past it. Its not going away until the chips fall. Enjoy the ride. God, I feel better half way through my second pint. Im a scene straight out of Leaving Las Vegas where I cant even sign my name until Ive had a drink or two. Actually, Im still shaking, but thats from the medication. I almost forget how medicated I am these days. Heavily, heavily. 300mg of Effexor, .5mg of Resperdal, who knows how much of Elavil, but I dont always take that one because I cant get up in the morning and function if I do. Which probably means I shouldnt be taking it at all, but I do what the inept doctor tells me to. Im embarrassed to go back to school to Heathers classes. I slept right through them on Wednesday. Then emailed my assignment to my prof for the late class. Told her I was having personal problems and was too afraid to leave my house. So now she knows Im wigging out. Martha already knows because I opened up my arm during her summer course and couldnt help but expose that. But Heather. I knew Id tell her. I knew Id break down in front of a pretty face and a brain like hers. Like I think she can understand and help me. But she cant. and more importantly, she wont. good for her. Id run from me too if I saw it walking down the street. She offered me a trauma drop in both of her classes. Im only up shit creek in one of them because I missed the midterm. I dont feel like I understand the material well enough to make a come-back. Im afraid to ask her what she means when she says we can work something out about the missed test. I dont feel like I deserve her consideration. So do I drop? The thought of being less involved in school scares the hell out of me. Its when I dont have anything to frame my time that I panic and fuck up worse. I dont have a job. This is all I do. And I need to finish school. And I need to prove to myself that no matter whats going on, I can still function. Albeit at a compromised capacity. But Im so smart, I cant let this part of my identity get swept up in despair. Or else give up everything, because theres not enough else going on that I can point to thats positive. I miss my girl. I miss hearing her breath when shes falling asleep. I miss her smell, her style, her mouth. And the passionate kisses I giggled at. I miss making love to her, how she tastes and how her skin feels beneath my fingertips. I miss her wild hair and the look in her eyes after we had sex. I miss love. I miss feeling like I matter and that I can still be loved and love well despite my painful past. I miss caring about her and being allowed to show it without shame. Claudia fucked me up. I need to be reminded that Im not that self that was killed with pain while loving someone. I really need her in my life. I know its going to hurt, but so does this. So does thinking Im too far gone to be loved anymore. And thats how its feeling. That the irreparable damage is just that. We shared something fantastic. Im not able to say that doesnt matter now that its gone. I think we both want to give more, but its beyond our faculties at this point. what would it take to augment the failure? Maybe patience on both our parts in necessary. Maybe well resume this once some time has passed and weve healed a bit. I feel like a chump for even considering it; I feel destined to lose. Like Im fooling myself or being dishonest to imagine all is not lost. Maybe I think that way to put closure on it, create some handle of control on a situation so beyond control. She said it: I dont want you not in my life. But is there a possibility that we two can come together again? She loves me, I know. Maybe not the way I wish for us, but she does. And I love her too, whatever that means. The love isnt part of the question. Its the logistics of getting together that I question. I dont want to hurt her. And I dont want to hurt myself anymore than I do already. Do I wait? Do I have any choice when I think of how rarely I feel this way about someone? This is going to be on the table for me for a long time. I dont think its merely a matter of time thats going to convince me to give up the ghost and go away. As much as I wish loving wasnt so complicated and associated with so much pain. Its there. Its not very often that it happens, but I love for life. Or maybe I just say that because Im still not over Claudia. My therapist dude said the other day that I love people as if they were God. Trying to make me look at the spiritual attachment I put into my women. Possible. But who thats ever been in love doesnt feel it spiritually? And who thats ever been in love with a woman not seen her as an embodiment of the Goddess? I see it in myself too, its not purely a misguided projection. Were all embodiments. Sometimes its hard to see. But yes, religion and romantic love get tangled up. Especially when youre not religious and a relationship has made such an indelible mark upon you. I should shut up now. I have to pee and I have to meet folks for a yummy dinner. I wish I was more in control of my feelings. I wish I wasnt mired with loss tonight and could go out and have fun. I wish I could love Kerri and not be hurt so much by it. Kerri if youre reading this Im sorry. I understand insomuch as Ive written here. And to you in the past. I want for us to be together. I want to have you in my corner and to give to you when I can. I love you, I have for years. I know this all is super scary. I dont pretend to know what Im doing half the time. But what I feel is huge, and thats what I go by these days. Even if our romantic future is crushed, I still love you. Its not about me. Its about the value of what were capable of as individuals and as loving beings. Thats what I look to for support. For confirmation that life is loving and ultimately redeeming. Thats all. Well figure this out. Either together or apart, but well be ok.

 Where am i? sitting in front of the computer as usual in my signature tank top and undies. Rewired the stereo yesterday to make writing more entertaining. Picking my face while I think wondering if I should have shaved in the shower this afternoon or whether it really matters right now. Thinking of the money I dont have but spent anyway on clothes and things for the house I never would have bothered with if I thought it was going to be only for me. New tv for the bedroom, a couple new pairs of pants, some shirts, a pair of shoes, all these things to decorate the walls, expensive coffee from Starbucks I suppose Im enjoying them. Just seems a bit silly at this juncture. It sure is simpler to be alone. If I feel like sleeping for 13 hours every night, and I am, I can do it. And I feel like stealing a blinking baracade from the construction site down the street from me, I can without someone around to tell me Im being juvenile. I suppose I wouldnt have even thought to outside of being impulsive (more than usual these days) and that my brother stole some once in high school. And drunk last night, it hit me that theres a symbolism involved. I feel like Im under construction. Or deconstruction depending on how you see it. Warning motorists to steer clear. The place here is immaculate. Some people let the house go to shit when theyre depressed. Me, I clean. Im stuck in the house alone anyway. Might as well tend to that environment in hope that my head will mimic the same order. Its a quarter after one, and Im still working on my first French press of the day. My bed looks like a hurricane hit it. At least I showered already. I never got that far yesterday. And I have impetus to get dressed today too. Im going to an early dinner with my aunt Paula. My sweet Aunt who loves me. Shes such an incredible woman. Blessed am I to have her in my corner all the time. So in the meantime? Theres no cleaning to be done save for a load of laundry. Maybe wash the sheets again or something. Take my reading to a coffee shop down in Hillcrest to get out of the house. Joy Divisions Love Will Tear Us Apart playing in the background. Love the lyrics. Love everything about that band. I made a CD last night, then made an extra copy of it and left it for KerriLou. Feel like a spaz bringing her things yesterday, but I have the sinking feeling that I wont be seeing her for quite some time. Its part politeness, part an effort to help me not be reminded of her when I see her pajamas neatly folded by the bed and her toothbrush in my bathroom. It hurts my heart to have that yanked out from under me so suddenly. It hurts me even more now since time with a therapist and some trusted friends have pointed out that I may have reason to actually be mad at her rather than it all being thrashed because Im a loser. It would be simpler if it was all my fault. But you know, I showed my cards from day one. She saw what she was getting herself into. And she told me time and time again when it got going that shes still not over her past breakups. We both fooled ourselves. Willingly at that. Theres no fault to place. I cant do the blame thing unless its blaming myself. I counter with self-criticism too quickly to blame her. And who cares about blame anyway? Its not helpful, just deflective of what lies beyond the you/me. The world is a painful place. Period. My favorite Talking Heads song. I forget what its called even, Nave Melody or something, but the lyrics are: Home is where I want to be Pick me up and turn me round I feel numb - born with a weak heart (So I) guess I must be having fun The less we say about it the better Make it up as we go along Feet on the ground Head in the sky It's ok I know nothing's wrong . . nothing Hi yo I got plenty of time Hi yo you got light in your eyes And you're standing here beside me I love the passing of time Never for money Always for love Cover up + say goodnight . . . say goodnight Home - is where I want to be But I guess I'm already there I come home - -she lifted up her wings Guess that this must be the place I can't tell one from another Did I find you, or you find me? There was a time Before we were born If someone asks, this where I'll be . . . where I'll be Hi yo We drift in and out Hi yo sing into my mouth Out of all tose kinds of people You got a face with a view I'm just an animal looking for a home Share the same space for a minute or two And you love me till my heart stops Love me till I'm dead Eyes that light up, eyes look through you Cover up the blank spots Hit me on the head Ah ooh

 Tonight I delivered all thats Kerris to an empty doorstep. I didnt want to meet her for the exchange, just to relieve me of the heartache of seeing her boxers and toothbrush in strategic locations. It hurt too much. So I got them back to her, along with a small gathering of white roses and a CD made to commemorate what has passed. And I feel good about it tonight. Glad it was a mission carried out solo. Glad not to have the interpersonal element rake my heart over the coals. I suppose I thought the pain would have been gone or at least lessened by now. But it hasnt. I miss her terribly. All the more reason to celebrate a giving-over of the situation without interaction. I love her. Im afraid of how long thats going to last. Im still not done loving my last/my first. It still hurts me, and it has been 4 years since I left her. Do I abide by Charlottes rule of relationship recovery as stated on Sex and the City? That it takes exactly twice the time you were together to get over it once it's over? I hope its that formulaic. At least then I can plan ahead. As it stands now, I dont /want/ to get over Kerri. I want to linger in the goodness, even though the loss is so hard its emptying out my spirit. I want to linger in this place too. I feel so much is here to be learned from. Even if I do think I can see all its parts pretty plainly. I keep thinking I can smell her scent on things. Nostalgic remembrance running me over, but only in my imagining. A scent on my clothes like Proust's madelines. Yet theres nothing in this house that has retained her perfume or her pheromones. I wish. When she borrowed a pair of drawers from me, I kept them soiled just in case thats all I had to be with her. This came upon me too suddenly to have planned ahead. Her boxers smell of bleach. I did that, and I gave them back to her tonight. I would have made a pillow out of them had I known that was the extent of our togetherness. My heart hurts. My whole core feels in need of evisceration. I wish I could do it with my own two hands. Just tear out the pain and mend it manually. But with what? I cant fix her pain nor my own. Trying to wrap my hands around eithers sounds like a disappointment waiting to happen. It won't work. I rewired the whole houses stereo system today. Now that I have no one to share my bed with me, my bedroom is a den of thudding, electronic warmth. About 16 feet of speakers surrounding me with songs so far not from far enough back into my life to remind me of pain any worse than what Im currently going through. I have tapes and about 100 songs from the late 90s to fill that bill, all that Claudia ruined for me on mixed tapes. Luckily for me, me and Kerri didnt share music while we made love. Just the beautiful music of her voice and her sweet moaning. Otherwise, Id have more on the do-not-play list. Still there's that old one from the first time we made out. Smashing Pumpkins Siamese Dream. I was 17 and too intimidated to actually make love to her. But I wanted to. If only I knew how, what that meant emotionally. Even having not done what i wished to, the moment stands out in my mind 8 years later. I was housesitting for someone. We had our fun on the floor, and I was overjoyed with the passion interlaced with our little venture. Every time I hear a song from that album, Im reminded of that night. Of Kerri, and of my very first girlfriend who I started seeing that same summer that the album was released. But it was Kerri who i let myself be known with. She probably doesn't know how much that night means to me. As much as I feel at peace in between the thighs of that fantastic specimen of female power, I realize I cant have it again. Not unless she comes around to getting over her fears of being with me. Of getting involved again with someone who loves her. Even if I suddenly went NA/AA on her, I cant be sure shed be up for a relationship. I'm too far outside of her world. and i don't wish for anything to change that. her sobriety is worth too much to chance it. But dont miss the point here; Ive fallen in love with her. As head-over-heals as it gets. I just see from here and before that theres no way to meet her on ground that could facilitate our coming together. Even I was 12-step property, I wouldnt be eligible to date someone like her for a good 12 months. Shed be shamed by her community to do anything less. And who am I to take her community away from her, turn that against her? If she fell into relapse because of me I dont know what I would do. Id still love her, sure. Of course. I loved her this deeply when I hated her at the same time for leaving town to get clean. I hated her because I thought she was leaving to kill herself. But I never stopped loving her. It's her who i'd worry about. Seeing her killing herself... i don't know how i'd handle that these days. Maybe I should learn to let love go when it no longer stands a chance for prospering. No. I cant. I loved her, I love her. Theres no time limit to this. Not on this level. Theres a deep, spiritual understanding Ive grown to know about her. Not just a I feel good when Im with you. Because god knows it didnt always feel good. It sure doesnt now. But I know her, you guys. Shes like a tattoo, but its something more akin to a organ transplant. Shes within me somewhere. It doesnt mean itll die without her in my life, but it does mean that Ive integrated my love for her into the innermost part of myself. I cant just shake that off as an unfortunate turn of events. Even if I never see her again, Ill always have a place cut away that only she can fit into.

 The phone rang this morning three times. I thought maybe there might be an emergency since all my memory told me there was nothing my 13+ hours of sleep was interfering with. So I finally rolled out of bed, groggy and slow, to reach for my mobile that was sitting by the front door downstairs. It was Gustavo calling to see if I was on campus and could make another SOC meeting. Our LGBT president forgot to remind anyone, so Gustavo is driving up here to attend. Me? I just want to keep sleeping. Restless all night dreaming of dark, supernatural forces infecting the people, coming in through open windows to take souls to hell. Lots of gothic churches and candelabras. Frustration dreams where you cant move quickly enough, watching my intentions fail in the face of powers too strong for me to overcome. So Im still pretty tired this morning. Its hard work battling dark angels. I remember thinking in my dream, why am I worried about a test in the Aeneid and Iliad? Im /living/ the battles right now! Theres little for me to do today but sleep. And hope I get some more pictures in the mail Id ordered online. Decorating with movie posters. I encapsulate it in quotes because its not too far from a high school students way of covering the blank walls of a bedroom. But Ill worry about impressing people with my shrewd eye for art when I can better afford it. For now, Ill let my identity tie-in to films showcase itself. I wish I owned deconstructing harry instead of just having the giant red poster in my hallway. I see that Bryan just dodged me on IM. Saw his name when I logged on, then immediately his status went from online to busy, something you have to manually change it to. Its not like away when you havent typed in five minutes. And now hes offline. I didnt even say hi. I dont bug him that much, do i? Well, at least I can rest assured that its already coming up on 11am. That means only a handful of daylight hours to go before no one would question my decision to go back to sleep. And there are always rearranging projects around the house to busy myself with. Just have to get out of these long black silk pajamas and tie my hair back and go to it. Go to something. I wish this depression thing were as simple as saying its from missing Kerri. But it really has little to do with her. If only it was that easy

 before: and after:

 Errands run with mom in the form of a trip to CostCo. Now Im home and feeling more and more like taking a nap. I did my duties of getting out of the house and going to a counseling appointment with Fritz. Now Ive nothing but the long day in front of me. Got a skull cap on. Exhausted from talking about things. The loss of my spiritual center up in Julian. The things it represents. Talking about Kerri but more than her, what issues I couldnt tell Kerri about that came up between us. All the things that have nothing to do with her and yet everything to do with what happened. Talking about how I see myself in relationships and in other situations because of what has happened with me in the past. All sorts of heavy points of discussion. So I think I earned a naptime.

 time to go back to bed. too much for one afternoon/5 hour day session. my glasses are missing, and i think i left them in K's car. i feel bad for having done it, but i have to text message her to inquire about them. so much of my just wants some distance to establish itself between us. just seeing pictures of her hurts my heart. my spiritual center is gone. no, it's not a fag-hating religious foundation that's missing. i hear enough of that crap living in this culture. it's my julian respite. there's no place to run off to for reconnection and revival. mom and i agree, it's too devastating to even talk about. i love her, that woman. i wish i said "this" woman, but i can anticipate the change of verbage and will do so as it happens organically. i love her, and i want to be there to help her get through what happened. then, there's me... and i'm having such a time, i don't know if my efforts in all their earnestness would even do me any good if she intended the same support. alhtough she has given that support. i just need time to let it run its course, my heart ache. and let her have the same space. you know, i was reading Sir Philip Sidney's criticism yesterday, and i kept thinking... where's the woman in my life who can also read this stuff and be an ally in trying to decode its meanings? i need a literary babe. not to take anything away from K, but it would be so wonderful to have someone who shared my world more. i'm watching sugiyama and capriati. time to sleep summore and watch the match play out. now that i've eaten (hoooray!!) and put the house tasks to finality. i can rest. again. morning appt with a counsellor. fingers crossed it fulfills something.

 it's 4:30, and i just woke up for the day. class in an hour. paper due. trying to decide whether to go or not and jsut email the assignment. matt is smothering me. help! someone's trying to fix me. do the paper, then go take a shower.

 I know this is kind of tacky to post online, but heres my take on things told to my aunt, Paula. Its not 100% real because its not to Kerri. Id balk at mentioning I think there was more involved in our break-up than what I did. Its more comfortable for me to blame it all on myself. So blame away if you like. Im giving you all the option. And here too, before such a monologue is published, are the pictures Ive been promising to post. hi, paula. i got your message tonight. sorry we missed each other. yeah, haven't been doing so hot. there's a lot involved here with me and Kerri. i've been taking it harder than i should... now that i had tonight with a friend, asking him to verify my suspicions that it's not my fault exactly. i've been upfront from the beginning about what's going on with me and where i'm at with relationships. how i've never really been in one outside of my therapist/Nightmare. and my propensity to mask it and other pain with alcohol. it used to turn her on for me to have beer breath. then when it got involved, that became the central focus for her. which is predictable seeing as though she's sober and went way further than me with the drugs when she did them. but my yummy, sexy beer breath turned into a crime of mine for her. me and my friend Bryan agree; it was an easy way out for her. she too told me from the beginning that she's mortally wounded from her past girlfriends. she said again and again that she's going to have to deal with a lot to be fully present with me. i listened to and comforted her through all this, but i don't think i was fully listening. she was telling me no, even though her hands and sex were telling me yes. i believed what felt better. and so, here i am. i'm glad i can rest knowing it wasn't my horrible coping skills that killed the relationship even before it got going. i hurt all the time, and drinking at the end of the day is my relief most days. unless i'm seeing her... i didn't around her. until one night when she pushed me off of her and i was reminded too strongly of my relationship with the married therapist. i sulked with guilt, and after that, everything ran quickly to a conclusion. what i regret most is that i didn't show my cards sooner. my coping showed before the extent of my wounding did. i tried too hard (out of habit, out of too great an empathy for another's pain) to show that i care about helping another thru their stuff without honouring my own reaction to an intense situation. i was so good with her. holding her while she cried, saying sweet things to strengthen her, allowing her to control the intimacy. when it dawned on me; i'm not listening to my own experience, my own hurts. so it didn't take long before i had a heavy, break-thru moment that took me charging ten steps back. and so we broke up. she says it's becuase of my pain and my drinking, that it's too much for her. but i see today that it's a lot of things, and that i don't have to ruin myself in guilt for not being better/more equipped to deal with things i'm still not over dealing with. and that yes, my way of coping these days is not ideal for building relationships, esp with those whose life depends on that not entering their world. but it took someone outside of me to tell me that for it to be real. why do i collapse in on myself and become dangerous for things my rational mind could easily tell me i have no basis for being that way? that's what's up. i'm still pretty fucking sad, but what else is new? mom's sad too. we talked today, and i knew by the sound of her voice that the two of you had talked already. i wish none of us felt this way. it's hard, exhausting, and not fair. there's so much pain in the world. and when i feel it in my little circle of loved ones, the weight of the rest of it comes crashing in like miles of ocean on top of a thin glass shell. i'm posting pics of me and Kerri on my blog tonight, ones i just scanned in at Bryan's. don't we look inexhaustably sexy together? god, she's a fabulous specimen. her heart's hurt too. i have nothing but empathy and love for her. Charlotte

 Woke up this morning in more of a haze than Im used to. Sedation from prescriptions Ive been told to take hit me differently without a belly full of alcohol to put me down at night. Hesitantly making my bed knowing full well that if I dont, I may crawl back into it and go back to sleep. Ill have to leave the house today to see Trevor and take him to a doctors appointment. Then Matt wants to take me to some self-help seminar Im not sure I want to go to, save to support him. He was so sweet to me yesterday. Talking to me after class, walking me to Student Psych Services. He called after his night class, so I invited him over to watch football and chat. We connect pretty well, me and him. And it felt good to talk about our relationship/friendship woes together. Im a little afraid of Amway brainwashing tonight, but I can handle the weirdness if it means being a good friend back to him. I think the best thing for me to do today is to catch up on my reading for my classes and polish up a paper I have due tomorrow night. And just lay low. Maybe take a nap later on, lift some weights at the gym. Sit still and be quiet.

 ok, guys. i'm doing a bit better at this hour. the rain is helping tremendously. thanks for all your support. prof. hayton intervened on me today, and i really needed that. i'm just a sad, sad woman.

 i want to stop drinking, but i can't. i have no support. kerri's gone 'cause of my drinking and because she too can't fully engage in the world. i'm going to a meeting. i'll take any support i can get.

 and two night's worth of sunsets from bed...

 pictures of the damned cat raping my leg.

 and i want my goddamned sound card to work! poor baby.

 Fuck this. Fuck all of this. Im so tired of making mistakes. Im tired of being confused and hurting. All this posturing to seem more together than I am, Im sick of it. Why do I never feel like I have people in my corner even when I do? I knew Id be spending the day like this the minute I woke up. I dreamt I cut myself last night and woke up thinking about it. Not even a sharp knife is making me feel better. I dont know what Im doing right anymore. I wish I had someone around to look at my life and point out something positive so I could get a sense of where I stand. I want to spiral today. I want a breakdown. I want some kind of control over my feelings, even if that means destruction. I want to do push-ups until I fall on my face. I want something to break under my hand. And I want a new, private blogsite to put my feelings where I dont have to preemptively negotiate what the response from my readership will be.

 Thanks to Jennifer for this: PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania (Reuters) -- A man described by authorities as a known sexual predator was chased through the streets of South Philadelphia by an angry crowd of Catholic high school girls, who kicked and punched him after he was tackled by neighbors, police said Friday. Rudy Susanto, 25, who had exposed himself to teen-age girls on as many as seven occasions outside St. Maria Goretti School, struck again on Thursday just as students were being dismissed, police said. But this time, a group of girls in school uniforms angrily confronted Susanto with help from some neighbors, police said. When Susanto tried to run, more than 20 girls chased him down the block. Two men from the neighborhood caught him and the girls took their revenge. "The girls came and started kicking him and punching him, so I wasn't going to stop them," neighbor Robert Lemons told The Philadelphia Inquirer. Susanto was later treated for injuries at a local hospital. Police said he would be charged with 14 criminal counts including harassment, disorderly conduct, open lewdness and corrupting the morals of a minor.

 Hm. What can I say this morning? I slept in as late as I could. Cold feet all night, sweaty face. Glad I went to bed early but disappointed that Kerri was having a rough go of things. I would have liked to stay up with her. So, what if she doesnt come around? What if all of this is her way of telling me without telling me that shes not ready to be doing this? How much do I give before it doesnt honor me anymore? Am I slipping into that familiar role of giving without the possibility of taking? I worry about these things. Mostly in the morning when I still don my pjs and carry a French press up the stairs and back into bed. I dont know what Im doing. And if its any measure of my predicament, I actually considered going to church this morning. Me, church whod have thought? I think I need it though. The sense of community, the bedrock of some imaginary ideology to rest against. With an attitude like that, I dont think its going to work. Like I said, I considered it. Im on my own here. I suppose we always are no matter what the circumstances, ultimately. So why do I say that? Am I trying to rephrase the situation with me at the centre again? Am I striving to reorient myself after making subtractions to the equation, just to be safe about how I proceed? Im not sure Im not losing anything by doing this. By hanging around in a third space between coming and going. Im left wanting. A vacuous space opens up that leaves me vulnerable. So am I afraid of the vulnerability? Attempting to secure myself by closing it down? Yeah. Ok, yeah. Ill go with that. I have a history too, and its an emotionally volatile one. I dont want more disappointed hurt. I dont want to suffer another conditional relationship with someone whos not in a position to give as I give. True, theres a pleasure in just giving. But I have to watch my back. I have to be more careful with how freely I let myself love, guard my heart a little closer.

 Uh. Nah. Changed my mind. I dont want to drive all the way to PB to see someone when it means hanging with his bachelor friends smoking dope and getting pissed. After a spell in the kitchen playing with panang curry and bamboo shoots in between reading Twelfth Night, I decided I could do better with my night. Like stay in. and yes, go back to sleep. Maybe his announcement that hes leaving town for good in the coming weeks upset me. There goes another contact, vanished. (Lights out in the houses. Well both be lonely.) Nothing like another friendship ending to cause me to turn right around toward the house and shut the door. One less person I can call up and have a good time with. F-uck. I guess it doesnt much matter. Meaning Im not surprised given what seems to go on so often these days. I want to go out on Wednesday with the class, but I dont want to go alone. Hm think Kerri would want to? Ha. Just the thought of asking and being ignored and/or denied cuts me. Cue shitty melodramatic music: Alone again, naturally. Hot tea and meds putting me to sleep. And Im all set to return to the happiest place on earth. 7pm, Saturday night. Do you know where your mid-20s energy is?

 1pm and a french press. Got an email this morning from heather hayton about a group outing to see All The Great Books (abridged) at the Lyceum theatre in Horton Plaza this Wednesday. Thinking of inviting Mark, my buddy. Weve had some good times together, sort of an almost-date friend. Radiohead together, some fun nights on the town and hes a lot more literate than a lot of people. I couldnt see bringing someone who cant appreciate the humor. So maybe Ill go. I could use some healthy time out on the town. That is, to distinguish it from those wild nights of hitting Montage and taking my shirt off on the dance floor. Which, by the way, sounds about perfect for tonights plans with Mark. This is so great getting to reconnect with my friends. Not that my hiatus was that long, but being with someone compromises certain aspects of my life. Last night with the happy couple was perfect to a pool bar I once went to as a 6 year-old with Daddy in the old neighbourhood. Yes, I still remember that. Only a block from my old preschool. I had the most vivid dream last night that I had a miscarriage. I got myself pregnant somehow, afraid to tell anyone by whom. And then I delivered at full term, and the baby wasnt breathing. Its eyes and mouth were sealed shut. Creepy. Later on, I got pregnant again (maybe it was the same situation, just too awful the way it played out the first time). I had a son. I woke up missing him. The strongest bond with that boy, Zachary. It felt so good to be his mother, loving each other. Is this a dream of hope after delivering a dead relationship? I have to get a jump on my reading this afternoon so I can go out tonight without the cloud of missed obligations hanging over me. Adieu.

 woo-hoo! i'm on the blogger homepage again!

 Trying not to hype myself up, but i'm losing the fight. Ive got that feeling, that manic, make-up-for-lost time feeling. Hitting the deck to do push-ups to make the wife-beater wearing look more authentic. Puttering, cleaning, reorganizing, not breathing as I should. Sure, the French press all went down quickly and Ive decided against actually eating proper food. The meds I should have taken last night and then again this morning are only just now circulating the blood stream. Ive got the old Jar of Flies album to punctuate my aggression. Looking now for the next installment to throw on. Mood music, something else to incite energetic outpourings. Not a poetry reading/writing night tonight. Tonight its out to play pool with Weez and Truelove. Like preparatory measures taken before a big match, Im dead set on whooping their asses again tonight. Im working to hit the zone. The unconscious brilliance of talent. Yet Im so broke tonight, the only way Im going to survive another night out is by virtue of crumbling credit cards or a trip to the coinstar. Im going to have to calm down before I get in the car. The last thing I want is for my mood to manifest in my driving. I feel alive tonight. Not just alive, but screaming-punk alive. My legs are shaking, my heart racing. I cant wait to hop in the car, turn up the music and roll up the windows so I can meet my hunger head on. And just scream to put it all somewhere. Fuck, I could just hump a wall like the stupidly frustrated beast biting my foot. Guess its good Im not seeing a withdrawn girl tonight; Id only feel the same as the cat. i keep throwing the fucker off of me, but back to the flame he goes. Goddamnit, I miss that body of hers. That belly, her adorable feet. Argh! Silence, ma jeune fille ! Pas ce soir !

 Yep-ola. Its 4pm, and I just woke up. This may have been the longest continuous sleep session in recent memory. I went to bed at about midnight, then not waking until a whopping 16 hours later. Whos proud of me, raise your hands. I dreamt of golf. I only brought my putter with me from the car and really needed my nine iron. The walking was amazing, seeing rancho santa fe in waning light of day, grabbing coffee and sugary things from Starbucks when the frustration of not being able to play too well exhausted me. I dreamt of a boy who was after me to date him. Like this dude I met last night at Scotts bar. As soon as I told him Im a lesbian, he walked promptly away. Ha! Asshole. Then I dreamt that this same guy and I, we were defending ourselves against mafia hitmen, got so wrapped up in the fear of nearly being shot that I proposed we shag out in the open field to document our defiance of bullets and anger. But then he couldnt get an erection. Wha? (just as I type the word, the cat seems to know it and grabs my foot to roger it) Strange night asleep with sweaty sheets and a heaviest eyelids keeping me from getting up. When the door rang twice (I feared my rubbish bins were all over the street, the only thing that would incite a visit from the neighbours), when the phone rang three times I just couldnt move. I guess knowing how much I enjoy those extra hours safely tucked away in addition to realizing I have nothing else to do thats pressing is what allows for these marathons. So Ive got my French press going a bit tardy today. No disability check in the mailbox for me yet today, so my plans will have to follow suit. Need to call back Mark and Luis. Im considering a repeat offence with the former to readjust my head still reeling from losing Kerri. Im such a guy sometimes; have consequence free sex with a friend to get your mind off of the much better sex youll never have again with the one you love. Im feeling saucy. He already let me know his roommates are out of town for the weekend. And me, no I dont think I could deface my love chamber with casual man-sex. Who am I kidding? Do it yourself, girl. Cheapening the deal isnt what you need right now. And anyway, skip the penis. Thats so not what I miss. I ought to think about showering in case the happy couple, luis and ms robin truelove, come on up here. Its been too long since Ive hung out with my friends!

 pardon my mouth. sorry. f-word everywhere today...

 Wait. How do people watch fucking Friends? I needed to be reminded of my hatred, so I left the channel on tonight. And now? I want to murder large groups of people knowing they love this shit. But who am I criticizing? I mean, bad writing infiltrates every idiot/illiterate household. Maybe Im overreacting! Is it their fault? All of our country hates bad comedy! right?... and this is ok because its all they know? Get HBO!!!! All of you, GO! Goddamn it, stop your diapering! Call your cable company!! Do it!! Before all the Curb Your Enthusiasm reruns are gone!! Something GOOD!! Please, for your own life get it.

 Fucking tension headache reeking havoc behind my eyes. Tomorrow I look for a place to get new glasses. I cant go without these things any longer. Getting out today to talk to Fritz (a good session) and then to see my mom to go to lunch with her and her two friends, Gail and Lucy. I got nervous and uncomfortable and shut down through most of it, but Im still glad I went out there and spent time with them. But before that, we hit 99 Ranch in Kerney Mesa where I picked up some choice bits from their bounty. Came home tonight to fire up my bamboo steamer for the pork and chicken buns I grabbed, then drizzled the evil pepper sa te sauce on them. Thoughts of a good masaman curry faded once I remembered Id bought another container of that sauce. I really should be cooking more. Being with Kerri threw me off the path. She doesnt eat, or she doesnt have the will to spend anymore time in the kitchen or with food in general. I find it interesting to watch how this whole thing is unraveling for me. For example, it took me until this weekend to get that this thing is over. Finito for sure. For some reason I figured shes retreat for a spell, regain her composure. Then wed reevaluate things. Why would I think that? I mean, really why after all this rather clear communication of our respective positions would I think shes gonna be right back where she left dust tracks in the air? Because for five fucking years I had to endure a woman who put me in that on-hold position. Shed be with me for a month or two, wonderful time of intense passion shared and all our free time spent together (and then some we sacrificed everything for that time). Then shed be in tears over her guilt. Her marriage, her kids, what she knew she was doing to me. Shed split. Just vanish for weeks, save for a steady procession of Im Sorry cards and letters in my mailbox. But I couldnt call her. Out of respect for her position and her family (the real victims), I wouldnt touch it. Id just sit back, snort chemicals, and weep. Because I couldnt get out of it. I couldnt do anything but suffer in silence until the moment when the phone would ring, and all the opiate attraction would cloud up in front of me and Id run right to it. It happened all the time. Maybe fifty times over those 5 years. Push and pull, no defined limits when either of us would voice them. It was hell, and it never seemed to have an end point. It still doesnt. I still cant tell you for sure, couldnt bet on it, that Ill never have some semblance of a relationship with Claudia in the future. I still love her. I do. And I guess talking about it this morning with fritz emphasized the point for me. It costs me too much to consider putting it away forever. I shared ME, a part of me with that woman that I cant retain as purely my own. Part of me, a very powerful part of my impressionable youth is tied up with what I went through with her. Discarding her means sealing off something. You may disagree with me or at least just hope Im fooling myself, but thats where I see the situation to lie. And the more relevant issue is this: I understand her. I saw that woman. The biblical Knowing of a person never made more sense to me than when I got to know Claudia. I know her and I love her. Because Im in touch with her humanity in a way that others fear to expose. It may have been intensely painful, but no one argues that it wasnt intense. I loved her so much, I stayed around. I dont want to love Kerri so much that I drag myself through the dirt to retain a connection that doesnt serve me. I dont. And today was another crumb of getting that. Shit, it sucks to love someone and accept it being over. I dont know that Im not going to love her anymore. Again, I shared a part of myself that I cant bear to let go of. And the two, yes, are inextricably entwined. I cant separate that level of trust with the woman who earned it. Ok, so maybe my judgment is skewed. But she earned it. She got a piece of me Ive never shown another. And so far, thats the most intimate place Ive been. Yeah, Im letting go of something big. But Im doing it. I wish I could make this rewind and happen a different way. I love her. I love everyone Ive let into my heart, although the list is brief. But there it is. The more the time lapses, the more ill understand what Im doing. and now, time to put up christmas lights to waste the night away.

 I rule! I wanted so much to stay here tonight. I was getting major anxiety having to go back out to a class tonight, knowing that going meant getting up in front of the class again. But I did it anyway. I showed up, I helped my prof with the audio/visual confusion she was going through and yes, I stood up in front of the whole class and facilitated a discussion on a GAY poem!! Of course, there wasnt much time to get into it and there were some giggles to accompany the line about poking at the meats and eying the grocery boys. But damn it, I stood up and did it. I even got a singled-out thank you from my prof at the end of the class. When I said Id be reading Howl except that its so long, this girl Lisa nearly fell out of her chair with excitement. So I offered to give her the CD with both that poem and the one I presented on. Made her day she gave a breathy, Really?! Ive been looking for a copy of that for eight years!! ta-da! I rule, I tell you. So I walked out of class tonight, cheeks swollen under flaring moon. The adrenaline of the day should have me tuckered out, but Im too wound up to slow down now. I feel like writing some more poetry for fun, so as a reward for being a good kitty, Im gonna.

 I finally have a break from one hell of a day. A good day, folks. Dont go worrying that I fell into despair again. I just had so much on my agenda, I didnt even have time to eat anything until 3pm. My brain is a little fried from the wealth and breadth of my accomplishments, but Ill tell you its a lot better than the feeling of the whole day passing and still being unshowered an in my pajamas slipping in and out of the safety of the bed sheets. I think Im lucky. Im smart enough to do well in my classes even with my head somewhere else. And Im tenacious enough to keep my head in the game even when distractions mount so high. And Im lucky to have killer friends with the consistency of clock work backing me up, never letting me to fend for myself all alone in those hours when I really need the help. Speaking of friends, I heard back from Kerri this afternoon. I checked my email when I got home from class, and there she was. Relieved I was to be validated that indeed she has been a ghost since all this transpired. I was beginning to wonder if maybe it was I who wasnt allowing for a proper silence. It still could be, but I feel satiated now that Ive actually heard from her. That shes ok but working a lot. And that she liked my poem or that she was impressed by the emotion, not necessarily a signal of liking it. She said she needs time to let the words sink in. I care about her, her struggle. Thats what the words were aimed at expressing. Nothing more. Aside from a kick in the pants for me to have written something so out of my element (an English sonnet with all its structure/confines) that /I/ actually like. I did so good today. And yes, I told myself this all through it. When I was wrapping up my last sentence in Haytons midterm, I stopped in my mind (had that split while writing where you can have your mind on many threads at once). I thought to myself, Good, baby. You did it. Scary to confront the failure of missing this the first time, but youre here now and doing swimmingly. Sounds a bit corny to me, but you should hear the tone I take with myself most other days. I showed up and I did it. I may only get a B on it, but please I was ready to take an F in the whole class just one week ago. Hayton yelled at us this morning. Well, not yelled but she was aggressively negative. Not to me, no. thats what I dont say much in her classes for fear my lack of brilliance at any given moment will set her off. My heart hurt this morning, and it wasnt even about me. She was frustrated with her perception of our dedication levels, and she wasnt about to back off of it. Told us to get out of school if we dont feel up to the task of deconstructing every verse of every piece of reading were assigned. Who can do that?! Well, I know she was questioning her behaviour because later on when I was taking that test outside of her office, she asked her TA whether she was too hard on us. And of course, cute, meek and mild Erin wasnt going to go against her. I agreed with her point, but not with her delivery. Shes scaring more of us not to speak and feel beneath the bar of success. You tell someone theyre dumb, and theyll believe it and start acting the part. Its a fine line, being frustrated and alienating us. Bless the rain. Id give so much to have this weather everyday until spring. And even then some. One day I want to move somewhere that I can wear my silks under my pants more days than I can here. It felt like a slice of Italy this morning getting out of the shower, loud music playing in the background as it was in my flat out there. Except my towel wasnt warming on the hotwater pipes like I rigged it in Bolzano. But slipping into those wooly socks and silk undies before putting on my heavy pants and a coat it felt fantastic. So safely tucked away in black. Tonights the poetry reading evening in my American Lit II class with Susie. Since Howl is such a long piece, I decided to present my other favourite of his, A Supermarket in California. About homosexual alienation and paranoia and loss and apostrophizing to Walt Whitman. Its only a page or two rather than 22 minutes of spoken word mania. But Ill offer to relinquish my mp3 of Howl to anyone who wants it in my class. It should be fun, although Im exhausted and want nothing more than to lock the doors and strip down into my pjs. Shes bringing coffee, my prof, and encouraging us all to bring food or something to share. Im bringing a bag of satsumas and my poem. More than most will do. And the paper thats due tonight (which I havent even reread, but I know Ill get an A on). So Ill go. Ive done the work, I have things to contribute. These are moments when I have to share myself and not heed the call of the recluse inside of me.

 a quiet night studying and watching the beautiful andy roddick on the telly. ate sushi with bryan (an incredible volcano roll at mikko's) to get out of the house finally today. on serve in the third, the studying finally put away (it's as in my head as it's going to be), and now it's time to pour mommy a drinkie and ease into bed. nightmares last night. sugar-fuelled dreams of waiting in line with martha stoddard-holmes to commit suicide. this whole lengthy process involved, glad we were on our way out but confused with how long it took to complete. institutionalised death. then another dream of being kidnapped by marketers of a pyramid scheme, unable to get home or call 911 for help. hope tonight i rest easier. no emails today. no calls. no word from kerri, not that i want or expect it. but i do. i think it's unnatural to separate this way. feels like punishment or spite or just plain problematic. where did the love go? i guess we all operate in strange ways under stress. but still... i guess i didn't sense this was dangerous enough to make me want to run and never look back. all these questions i've answered for myself. the longer it takes to reconnect in some fashion, the less likely i'll want to come around to be her friend after everything. i mean, i wouldn't even want a friend who up and disappears like this. i'm not good with conditionals. i don't dig abandonment, but i sure get it a lot. i'm certainly not done talking about this. but i can sense my pulse getting stronger, more rapid, and i'll be damned if my emotions for her affect my school performance again. i'm putting this away and going for my rest. i'm being a little irrational; it hasn't been long enough. i think i'd just cry if i saw her. i'm speaking from a wound. never mind. andy wins. good job, cutie-pie.

 Im supposed to be studying, but all I want to do I dress in black in wait for the rain and write poetry. Drinking tea and contemplating Howl having listened to it again today. Will the class want to listen to all 20 minutes of it being read aloud? Such despair and sacrifice (Moloch) and disillusionment and feverish poetic ecstasy. I almost dont want to share it in case someone doesnt like it. I dont want it messed up by the critiques of others. If only I could put down in words the depth of experience of that poem. I have a goal. This is good. Tomorrow is poetry day. First in Haytons class where I submit my own poem, then to Susies class where I feast on poetry of others. A diet of words too powerful for the page they must be spoken, vibrate with sounds meant to go with them. Back to the studying. Little bits all day and I should be alright tomorrow. At least I feel inspired about something today. My passions returning to me after being slapped back a few feet. Im cursed and blessed. I get to feel it all, and all of it to the core. Kerri doesnt know what she gave up. Doesnt even know.

 Writing that poem last night did something to me. Im thrown back a few steps, feeling nostalgic instead of like Im moving past this thing with Kerri. Im mad again, Im hurt again, I long for her again. Mostly convinced that its all part of the extraction process, but it still sucks that all of this has to be going on at all. I even told my mom about the relationship. I didnt think I would, but then I sent her the poem she knew I was working on. And she really liked it and said she was sorry I was going through this with someone I obviously love. Nice to have mom in the corner, not telling me Im destined to hurt by choosing to be gay. Im thinking back to things Kerri said just a little over a month ago. In her blog, about how my hands speak to her, touch her so deeply. Spliced with worry that shes not going to show up for a relationship. She began by calling me her f buddy in her blog. Then to the hands thing, then to a total break filled with words of longing to run. Fucking fantastic trajectory. Fuck it. I lost this one. Might take me another few years to try again, but what was good was good. After all Ive fucking been through, I deserve some more of the good. Not this vanishing act under the guise that Im too damaged to be loved. Fuck that. I deserve so much better. Shes not ready to be loved again. Ok. But I am. Im too passionate to be put on a shelf for when its more convenient and easy. I need to meet someone who desires to give like I do. And can stand up and take it when someones loving her. These half-measures are getting me nowhere. God damn it, I love her. This sucks!

 i was happily sleeping until i realised how much energy my brain had for conceptualising what it would take to coach Hayton's kids in soccer. i was imagining it as i started to slip into it, but i got so charged up, i felt like i should put it somewhere. no, my expertise has not been asked for. i just thought about it. i'd be good if i could manage a finite amount of intense contact; be like one of those celebrity hosts. a quick fix coach that just gives the team and the usual facilitator a heads-up. like, ask the kids where they get killed the most. pretend this is the hardest position... lie to them. then use one of 100 reasons why the position is important an how interrelated it is on other positions. deflect. but acertain where the strong players are. put them in the back. the rest up the middle. a right mid and a right forward. kids can't play with a left side unless they're good. or unless they're so bad, the other teams' right side is giving them a lashing. unless there's a gifted lefty on the team, no matter his position now. throw him on wing. do dimension drills, emphasising the use of space. hit the corners and bring it back. teach the mids to charge the 18, then sprint back, the wing Ds to cover their players. aggressive tactics, but on a spotty kids' team you can do that. if the kids and their inherent skill is trustworthy and you're communicating it properly. makes me wish i had kids. but more than one, 'cause who wants to listen a bossy, ex-player when your kid is only one on a team? so i relistened and listened again tonight to Ginsberg's "Howl." twice so far, and i think i'm due for one more with the lights off. so powerful. so dark. i'm not a fan of 50s despair (think it's trite, actually), but his poetry rings with such raw, bleeding truth. ok, things that bleed don't ring save for a severed ear. but you get the point. or, you hear what i'm saying. "listening to the crack of doom on the hydrogen jukebox" (43-4) "who broke down in crying in white gymnasiums naked and trembling before the wachinery of other skeletons" (89-90) "who cut their wrists three times successively unsuccessfully, gave up and were forced to open antique stores where they thought they were were growing old and cried" (155-157) "the nitroglycerine shrieks of the fairies of advertising & the mustard gas of sinister intelligent editors, or were run down by the drunken taxicabs of Abolute Reality" (160-163) and yes, i emailed Hayton to tell her how fantastic i think her kids are. giving them tangerines against mom's will ("Don't feed the Gremlins!" she jokes, yelling to the back of class)... it was the highlight of my day. and it really was. what killer kids. i'm half asleep. i gave Vato a prissy girl-bed made of a heating pad. since he didn't want to sit on it while i was coaxing him to it, i feel like going over and turning the thing off on him. but the point was to spoil the idiot, even if he only has a cat brain with which to get it. i sent mom a copy of my poem. think i'll be uninvited to thanksgiving dinner?

 i had an assignmnet given today for my wednesday class. here's what i did, an english sonnet, iambic pentameter and all. so i got right to it. Charlotte Conrad Hayton 308A Nov. 12, 2003 An exercise in writing an English sonnet For Kerri Lou Prelude to a Breakup A quiet evening next to Kerri Lou, Beneath serene facades of inky flesh, Her underwater scene of peaceful blue, Im finding things so frighteningly fresh. Her rhythmic breathing like a flame, a flume, Say secret signals, spoken eer so soft; My inhalation of this pain consume from her the hurt she wears at such a cost! You loathe the Mistress who has left you lone, Ive grown too old since then to play with death, With needles plunging, soul as bare as bone, You say, I cant afford to live on meth. I hold your head to mine, for we I dream, To break the bonds with hell so we can outlive mastery.

 Hayton brought her kids to school with her today. how proud she must be. they're ten and 8, i think, and both were contributing something to the conversation about symbolism and significance in Beowulf. and so incredibly cute; just like her. school is making me feel better today. one more class. then it's back to the closed-blinds. i'm warming up into resuming full function.

 more poetry... an excerpt from Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey's "Alas! so all things now do hold their peace" 9In joy and woe, as in a doubtful ease. 10For my sweet thoughts sometime do pleasure bring, 11But by and by the cause of my disease 12Gives me a pang that inwardly doth sting, 13When that I think what grief it is again 14To live and lack the thing should rid my pain.

 here's a nice poem that cheered me up. that, and a wonderfully validating conversation with Dana. Farewell, Love Sir Thomas Wyatt the Elder Farewell, Love, and all thy laws forever, Thy baited hooks shall tangle me no more; Senec and Plato call me from thy lore, To perfect wealth my wit for to endeavor. In blind error when I did perserver, Thy sharp repulse, that pricketh aye so sore, Hath taught me to set in trifles no store And 'scape forth since liberty is lever. Therefore farewell, go trouble younger hearts, And in me claim no more authority; With idle youth go use thy property, And thereon spend thy many brittle darts. For hitherto though I have lost all my time, Me lusteth no longer rotten boughs to climb. early 16th century. nothing like homework to take my mind off a broken heart. i hope i get called upon tomorrow in class to read aloud something i liked. thanks, Dana. you're right; we're upset with her. and yeah, i'll have the strength to give my heart again someday soon. just angry and hurting and missing her now.

 notice the picture frames put up before the artwork has arrived from ebay/barnes and noble. i decided to skip the pictures of the bathrooms and my giant closet. i'm actually doing pretty well today. amazing. i'm functioning, i'm efficient, i'm looking forward to school tomorrow. i got the mail today!! first time all week... oops! and i have laundry frying in the dryer. got to go.

 think i'll add some pictures here and create a cyber house tour...

 Dude! I think I was close to being arrested tonight! Morbid celebration! Hooray!! I stole some construction-zone markers. So when I came home with yet another piece tonight, I knew what was coming when my garage door and front door were being hammered with fists. Part of me was tickled with the attention, wanted to counter their anger with the always effective are you sure you want to try to usurp the hell Im already in? Its still a bit beyond me that I dont go sit on their stupid barricades naked just to see how theyd respond. Im stupid enough at this hour to play with it. So I gave my passport over to these goons of almost-cop level security. I dreamt last night that I was living the life advertised in Grand Theft Auto. Steeling cars, fucking women beyond my field of access. Buying off the authorities. Etc. it was lovely having the access, but then Im there with Haley, this girl Im smitten with at school. I was licking her when I realized she had the marks of someone with a STD. I stopped in my dream, figuring it was too late. Feeling infected for going this far before checking into her health. I screwed myself. No priors, but there it was. Isn't that symbolic?

 No, I didnt just get up. That was almost an hour ago. I would have awoken earlier, but I was having these strange nightmares of lightening strikes and dead people, trying to run from toppling buildings and mourning with friends as word came that others were killed. Images of bridges, flawed and bending, coming crashing down on top of people. Strange stuff. I was glad when the phone rang twice to get me to shed the sweaty sheets and get a move on the day. To the gym. Thats my one and only priority today. Its free, and I need the workout. Been gaining weight steadily these past few weeks, and Im not about to let it happen without a fight. True, some of it is muscle in my arms, but a lot more of it is chub on my tummy. Emotional eating. Its not a good coping method. Like drinking, it only makes me feel worse later on. Oh my! I know what I dreamt about! It was Claudia. All of a sudden I was on the phone with her. Like old times. I was telling her how hot she looks these days with all the running and weights. I was off the gym to see her. Thats all I can remember. So am I too going to the gym to regain that sense of what? To look as hot as I can possibly manage to better ensnare a bride? I have been getting the bug to go out and date a bit. Or just spend more energy polishing my rsum. Maybe I just miss thinking that someones appreciating the hard work. Besides just me.

 Is there anything more gratifying than cleaning your house? I borrowed my moms 800 dollar vacuum and went to town on the place (I dont have a vac of my own). Then I moved the dinning room table to make it more user friendly for the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday. I decorated the table with some things given to me way back from Kerri. Bleached the grout, ajaxed the sink. Bleached my whites in the laundry. Swiffered all the floor space. Watered the plants and repotted those who needed it. Then of course, I mailed letters, bills, and got the mail (finally). About the only thing I havent done is taken a shower. When youre up to your elbows in cleaning, it makes no sense to do anything about your own filth until youre done. And anyway, I was sweating in my for-a-purpose workout. So I pulled out of my downward trajectory and into a one-stop event of making up for lost time. I still want to get to some more little bits for cleaning, but I realize I might be better off relaxing after vacing the stairs by holding it at weird angles. My back was already groaning after my bike workout this afternoon. Its a Friday night. No, Im not planning on going out. Unless its to get a pint with Bryan when he gets off of work later on. Instead, Im planning our feast, what Im dubbing, The Thanksgiving Day Festival of Gluttony. Whats on the menu so far? Well, my scallop dish is all set. I bought the caviar, the scallops, and the crme fraiche this afternoon. Also will be my Dads family tradition of parsnip mashed potatoes. A 3-1 ratio of potatoes to parsnips. And of course, plenty of fresh mashed garlic. I think Bryan is going to make a pork tenderloin with a blueberry compote. He did it before, and it was fabulous. Also, a mache salad with raspberries and feta. Thats a favorite salad of mine, but I may ask that the ingredients be bought and brought by someone else who can better afford things. Just a simple raspberry vinaigrette to go with it. Bryans making a cranberry chiffon pie. Weve all had it before, its light texture and mild sourness. Its delicate. A better fit for the lighter fare. Im buying a bunch of veggies like zucchini and onions, mushrooms and peppers to skewer and put atop a fired up charcoal grill. I love my cast iron beast. So hot, so good. Luis may or may not decide on his tried and true stuffed tomato recipe. Meat in abundance like proscuitto and ham and ground beef jammed into broiled tomatoes. So good. Maybe some bruschetta while were getting things cooking. And hell, whatever else the gang wants to eat. Maybe Ill get some champagne to go with my scallops; its the best pairing. Oh yes, all dishes will come with their own bottle. Ill have to get Vato something special for putting up with the four of us being in his space. Maybe a bowlful of grilled chicken. Or cook up a pheasant for him. I dunno yet. But hes my date, so he gets to eat well too. Maybe a big spliff of catnip. Time to shower. You know, I sure wish I could have had Kerri come on down to join us. For once having me cook, she just sit and eat. But one, its too over. And two, she never eats and I dont think shed appreciate our efforts. Dating a chef sounds good on paper, but when she wont eat a thing, it sucks. Sorry, it suckED. And you know, theres no way Id ruin my favorite holiday with more heartache having to see her. (oh, and Im now learning that the heartache is being misinterpreted; its actually anger.)

 Still a hazy fog of Elavil hanging about my head. It takes a full twelve hours to wear off, but boy do I sleep soundly. Im supposed to take it every night, but I have to be sure to have that much time to sleep (and I cant have had more than two beers all day). I planned ahead by having absolutely nothing to do today (hahah) and nothing but a big bellyful of lamb vindaloo before bed. Ok, so I have one thing to do today. Register for my Spring Semester! My LAST semester as an undergraduate! Hooray! The portal opens at 1pm, so I need to hang around here until that moment comes. Theres only one section available to fulfill each of my remaining requirements, so I cant afford to be lax about securing my spots. So Im taking LTWR300B history of literary commentary II (a boring class unless you like critical theory. I got an A in the first half, 300A, so well see) LTWR460 cultural studies (Im assuming this is like global lit, but this is a 400-level course instead of a 300) LTWR336 queer theory in literature and film (a class Ive taken twice already with different subjects paired with the 336 heading of lit and film. As both times, but this one Im taking for fun because its QUEER THEORY, the first time anything like this has been offered at CSUSM. If I dont register in it, it may never be offered again. I wont get credit towards graduation) LTWR504 Virginia Woolf author studies (a graduate course taught by a favourite professor of mine, Dawn Formo. Its going to be difficult, but the challenge will be met with enthusiasm if its interesting) GES103 Science! (The class Ive put off for my entire college career. I hate it, but Im taking it to get the hell out.) =15 units. The technical writing course, the creative writing workshops, medieval literature, study of westerns (?what?), and the class on epistle writing will all have to wait until I graduate and come back for some part time for-fun enrollment in the future.

 I can only imagine what Id feel about this story had I been alive when it happened. This is the second night now that Ive sat still to watch some more of the media rehash of the Kennedy assassination. I never really felt much about it until this time around. The conspiracy theories exhaust me, but its the story as a /story/ that has me more interested. Makes me want to go back and give that Don DeLillo book another shot, the one where he rewrites the life of Oswald as historical fiction. Id begun the book while in Italy, but it was a bit too distant from me at the time to really sink my teeth into it. Story. I keep thinking of plot devices while showering or vacuuming. Something paralleling the poetic flow of energy involved in those activities. Not that I can remember them now (and of course, to reveal them would compromise the punch). Its all a lot more than a device being implemented, but theyre key to the craft. More important that the actual creation right now is the potential to create. Theres a sense of possibility Im indulging in. a potential outlet of energy that both gives shape to and generates more possibility. I want that life. I want to do this. I need a mentor. I need a world of writers to help guide me, provide an example for me to emulate. None of these academics who reside outside of that life. And of course not more semiliterate friends. I need for my writer life to move from my private time alone to more of a centrally integrated position. How do I do this? The Elavil and Risperdal are kicking in. time to crawl into bed. Silky black pajamas matching my fuzzy pants kitty.

 Wow. ABC news has no problem posting a picture of the boy whos accusing jackson. Even giving his first name of Gavin to go with the picture. But yeah, reading this story to go along with it makes it really clear to me that the charges against him are going to be proven in court. Excerpts from the story: Asked how he responds to people who say it is inappropriate for a 44-year-old man to be sharing a bed with a child, Jackson said: "I feel sorry for them because that's judging someone who just wants to really help people." In a later interview he called it "a beautiful thing," saying he was just a grown-up who was "trying to help heal a child." As Bashir questioned him further about the 1993 allegation, Jackson became visibly upset, and gave a tearful assessment of the condition many American children find themselves in. "People don't even eat with their fathers any more, or their mothers. The family bond has been broken. It's an outcry for attention [when] kids are going to school with guns. They want love, they want to be touched, they want to be held.... I'm just very sensitive to their pain." What about the road to hell and best intentions? So sad. That Im paying this much attention to the story!!

 Does anyone else feel sad for Michael Jackson? This guy is so wounded. What a private hell he must live in to make himself look like that, to molest little boys, to live in his very public skin. It doesn't excuse illegal behaviour, but it's important to reframe our anger at him. He's a dangerous weirdo, yes. But he's been victimised too. But shit, man. This kid has cancer. He molested a very vulnerable person. That's so horrible. Maybe he maintains his innocence that nothing sexual happened because he doesn't really exhibit a sexuality. [Girlfriends? Boyfriends?] He's still a child developmentally, so he's stuck at what age? Latency? He's compelled to connect with kids on the same level. But boys only? Does his even know what "sexual" means? I don't think he does.

 Garage door goes up, car goes in, garage door shuts, car turns off. Even locked the inside door when I walked in. I cried to Fritz this morning, too troubled by what disappointment and embarrassment I suffered last night to hold it in. I quite possibly will go back to bed now, but I do feel better knowing someone out there knows how Im really feeling. How easily dismissed I can be as I was last night, how Kerri has been able to erase me from her life so completely, how much safer I feel just hiding out in the house. And how completely crazy I feel in the face of Heather. Such a disorganized personal life. What ever she must think of me. I think Im going to call Paula, see if shes free after work to get together for dinner or something. Then go back to bed until later. Reset my disposition with sleep. Take my stupid meds.

 Well, lets see. I erased two numbers out of my phone book last night. KerriLou, of course. I wont be needing that number anytime soon. And Scott, who left me hanging last night. Yup, I got flaked on. And pissed me off so badly, I drove all the way downtown to meet my professor, paid her for my tickets, and drove all the way home in tears without seeing the show. I was too upset, too embarrassed to stay around. I just wanted to let Heather off the hook with the money shed already spent on my word that Id be there. You know, its hard enough to want to leave the house these days. But then the treatment I get from these friends of mine its way beyond my understanding. Scott had better be dead or have had something tragic happen to him yesterday. His phone was off all day, all night. I left maybe five messages for him that he could have checked if his phone was broken or lost my number. Wed planned on this since the weekend and even made plans to go out before the show since then. Id spent hours researching the best place to get a glass of wine in the district. I fucking missed my class last night to go to this thing. So today I look like I feel. Fucked up. Eyes all swollen and puffy from drinking myself to sleep. Part of me was ready to roll on over to Marks house to blow some coke anything to take my mind off it all. But alas, I thought better of it and did my dirty dealings at home alone where driving wouldnt endanger me further. I finally ate something at ten (Id been waiting to go out to dinner, you see), and once I did that I fell right asleep. Id still be sleeping, but I have an appointment to talk to Fritz in about an hour. And when thats done, Im coming right back to bed. Raise a glass to Scott, everybody! A big fuck you! um, Im having abandonment issues today.

 i fixed the blinds. now all i want is to shut out the world and go back to bed, to hell with my plans tonight. Creating a state of rapture for myself. Downloaded Bryan Ferrys song, Slave to Love . I heard it on the radio the other night, my foot leaning against the pedal, fingers on the window control, open road and earsplitting sound. Roxy Music reminds me of abandon. Youthful, consequence-free nights alone with a friend I developed a crush on. The beauty was that it was safe. I never hear from that woman anymore. The time together sealed like a vault, and I keep it that way. Coincidentally, the song that followed reminded me of Kerri. An album that used to remind me of high school and winning CIFs in hockey with my very first girlfriend. But the night when me and Kerri made out on the floor of a friends apartment that I was housesitting in PB. Thats what Siamese Dream reminds me of now, ever since I was 17 and that happened. I was so young, so eager. So affected. The whole Smashing Pumpkins album giving beat to amorous expression. I was so blown away being with her that night even though I was too young and experienced to feel I could be present with much more than a makeout session. I think of that night now. How afraid I was. How afraid she ended up being years later. Its interesting is all. I assume shes still thinking about what happened, thinking of me. But truly, Im still hanging on the fact that she erased me from her life so whats the word Im looking for? Completely? Yeah. I guess all that time shed call me char-let-go she was trying to teach me the skill of utter detachment. Or its hard for her, this break. Im hurt, so I tend to want to side with the assumption that shes completely vanished. Its simpler. Im upset to admit it, but I really am letting go of her. Letting go of the hope that shell come around, sure. But more poignantly, that shes out of my life forever, in any capacity. There wont be a reunion of any kind. Shes wiped her hands of me, and Ive followed suit. What I stand holding now is not a remnant of her but instead a scrap of relationship-loss. Its no longer about her, and that bothers me (because it signals that a fundamental decision has been made that Im sticking to). Its a different level of mourning. Its like recoiling back into hibernation. I quite enjoyed letting myself be known by someone. I may have misdirected my loving, but that doesnt diminish the value I place in the experience. So its the experience of myself I now mourn. Not her. In fact, shes so out of my now that Im not sure Ill be able to see her again. Does anyone blame me? I dont care if you warn someone youre unavailable. Yet your body and a lot more of you is contradicting that. The words mean nothing when it comes down to it. Dont show up if you cant back it up. You showed up, honey. Words are one thing, but the look in your eyes late in the night fuck, thats incongruous. What was I supposed to do? Shut down on you like you did to me? Shut down on you like you expected me to? Fuck, that Ive been blaming myself for the drinking as causing this whole thing. It wasnt until you disappeared from me that I sought alternative modes of coping. Good or bad, it wasnt anything bigger than your unwillingness to show up with me. You knew about my coping when you started this thing, kissing me in my garage that day at my house. Then you throw down your trump card and disappear. Thats fucked. At least you warned me for what I was in for. With all the anger and pessimism you see in me, I guess you appealed to my optimistic side. Go figure. I feel sad for her, though. I could have been good for her. Bad in some respects, sure. But having some light in my life sure does help to augment my trek to bettering myself. I guess I hoped I could be that for her as well. Foolish heart. (insert Journey song here) I want to be a good person. Why do things like this make me question whether I can really offer that to anyone? I know Im a loving soul. I feel it when I touch someone I love. Dont tell me its not in the cards for me to be able to parlay that into a relationship where someone can readily accept it. I keep getting slapped with painful punishment whenever I let it out. Makes me want to hate that part of me. It causes so much pain. Slave to Love . Now Im crying and I have to pick up Scott in twenty minutes. Fuck my heart. It hurts too much to bring it along with me tonight. I think I need a beer. God, that song is sad. I wonder if Scott forgot. That's all I need, to be flaked on.

 Stupid blinds broke. How new are these? So Im struggling to see the monitor. Thatll teach me from being awake in the daytime. I just realized something while smoking a cig in the garage this is the first time Ive been dumped. True, someone once cheated on me with my best friend at a party I threw for her birthday. But this is the first time Ive been directly let go. Ive nothing to say about it outside of stating the fact. Trying to plan the night tonight with Scott. I want to go downtown before the traffic gets bad, but I doubt thatll happen. Im in all black as expected. Ill have to go by his house and pick him up eventually. Dinner before? Just a drink? Shoot, I need to wash the car. No sense being dressed up with a dirty car. Right? Am I right? I think my penpal might be homophobic. She read my blog about the lesbian writer desire. why would you want to write lesbisfiction? great. I need to leave the house eventually. I need stamps still. And to get warmed up for the night. A little sun in my eyes to wake me up. Hell, its the end of November and its 80 degrees out.

 i want to send a message today, in light of the mass. court ruling on gay marriage: give us civil unions that guarantee us the same rights as married people, and make it stand nationwide rather than limited to state lines. grant us that, and you can have your silly ritual back to yourselves. is this so difficult to achieve? religion is silly anyway; personally, i want nothing to do with it, and because of that perspective i feel i'd be outside the game even if i wanted to marry a man. but i don't. just give me equal protection under the law. and will you please stop pretending your dismissal of queers is going to strengthen your community?! hatred doesn't make the taliban go away, does it? so get used to it! it's about multiplicity, this country. i don't complain about your divorce rate or the domestic violence that breeders are so prone to. WE ALL MAKE THESE MISTAKES. get over yourselves. to each their own? you're offending your Christian god as much as we are if you're living by the scriptures. i won't even start ranting on WHO wrote your beloved book. or that all of you who have ever had sex purely for pleasure are going to the same hell you've designated for us. Jesus teaches to get over your piety. and love! not spit out hateful words at those that love differently than you in their private affairs. SO BACK OFF!!! or run the risk of militancy. we've got less to lose being the outsiders. don't push us. i'll fight for my rights til the end. and there's more strength out there with just as much a will to fight than i do.

 I got myself a new penpal today. A girl in germany emailed me (Ive been on a penpal website for years), so I emailed back. I like those anonymous connections. They never last that long, but its a trip to help someone with their English, find out how theyre living their lives. The whole postmodern fragmentation I so enjoy. Bleached the shit out of my bed, and I cant wait to get into it. But alas, I have social obligations with Bryan. Ill have to postpone my lust for bleach until later. Were gonna watch Frida together since I own it and hes not seen it yet. And he made lasagna and got some vino. Why do I care if I look good to go out tomorrow night? Is it to impress Scott? Or because its downtown? OR, because Heather will be there, and its a venue outside of our usual? Yep-ola. Floor-length black coat. Maybe Ill even make it to class tomorrow instead of sleeping until one.

 See? Now I need to be doing that more often. I feel so much better after lifting a 30 pound barbell over and over, doing 200 sit-ups, 30 of cardio, lat pulls, shoulders lifting as much as some of the boys in there, but definitely outshining them by not resting in between sets and doing sets of situps instead. I now have a goal; to get my arms back. I gained 5 pounds in the last 3 weeks since all the trauma, but if I get back into the workouts (even these gentle ones and yes, this is a gentle one) Ill surely drop the excess without even trying. Its a way to get tough, to feel powerful, to be in control of something that affects my sense of self as well as my emotional wellbeing. A positive self-image and a fix of endorphins, and I cant lose. Well, it goes a long way, but its not the cure-all. I have a mental picture of who I want to be, and Im going to achieve it. God knows I have the will power and discipline. I want to toughen up the outside, feel stronger in whatever form that takes. Im posting a weekly goal chart on the fridge. Nothing ridiculous, but small steps to concentrate on real achievements within my grasp. Im trying really hard here to get myself back on track, folks.

 Going back to the gym today. Not because I feel a desire to make myself look better for attracting others but as a reclamation effort. To do it for me and my peace of mind. The situps and pushups are fine, but I need to sweat harder than that to release those endorphins. I have to leave the house today anyway to buy stamps to mail some bills. I want to do some shopping too, but Im not sure where to go for what I have in mind. Ill leave it vague. Best to get out the door now before I get caught up in another project.

 I want to be a writer. Of lesbian fiction, I want to write. I just bought a collection of short stories from B&N that I began this afternoon in between sets of push-ups and sit-ups. And Im not saying that the work is bad, I just know I could do better. Theyre so simple, two dimensional. I have the time. I want to write. Id sit here and do some tonight, but I have to go meet Mark. My check finally came, but I owe so much, I couldnt take out any cash until tomorrow. So embarrassing. So its plastic again. And again, I wish I could reneg on my plans to go out. I just opened a bottle of pinot and am through half a glass, and I think Id rather stay here and think about it. I think tonights the night that I put the pictures of Kerri up in the attic. Literally, theres a big chunk of storage up there that I can use to get things out of sight, out of mind. Resolve has struck me these past couple of days to make those gestures to myself. To free myself up from feeling bound to the loss. I think I hold onto things like this too long because I feel by not doing so, Im disrespecting her. But shes not here to see how devoted to honour what happened between us or how lovingly I move on from the break. And quite honestly, the moving on is happening faster than Id expected, so I might as well let it happen. If she wasnt so fucking beautiful, the pictures might not affect me. But there she is. I could just eat her alive again and again. Man, she was fabulous. (notice the past-tense application) Im excited to see Mark. Even a little interested in some lovin coming out of the night. Hes the best male lover Ive been with by far. Except that he has a hairy chest, and that makes me want to shrink. And hes usually a total sweetheart. Hes not a woman, but thats no reason to write him off completely. It will be fun. As long as I dont compare it to someone else and that level of experience. More trust than a casual, consequence-free fuck is necessary before Ill be treated to such a thing, I know. But if it took 25 years preparing for what happened with Kerri, I can wait another long spell before it happens again. Who knows? Maybe Ill be able to bring a little piece of that with me and make the most of whats available. Or propel me into a vow of chastity. To the attic! Then to Marks. Pardon the juxtaposition; thats not supposed to pair up as so causally explained. Maybe Ill take them down w/o thinking so it doesnt bear any extraneous consequences.

 The meds. They have to change. Slept another 14 hours last night, missing my classes. I could still sleep is it the Elavil or the Depression? I went to bed at ten after only two beers, so its not like I was acting irresponsibly. What gives? I have to get up today if for no other reason than to get my check and deposit it, kill the red ink that has been lying in wait for me in the depths of a broken bank account. Sucks to be dependent on a disability check for financial sustenance. And I need to get up to pay some overdue bills, stretch my aching back the pain keeps me in bed some days, and this was one of them. Maybe I slept on it wrong. I had nightmares about going to the play but it was with Mark. He didnt research the night properly, and he bought me the wrong parking permit causing my car to be towed. The whole dream was trying to locate it with him on the cell changing his mind to whether he was even going to come meet me or change his plans again. I was in a hurry the whole time, but no one at the parking lot seemed to care about retrieving the car from the impound. Im too tired to even waste energy trying to place what that means. Mark represents irresponsible fun? My means are being compromised by short-sightedness? God, this is hard not going back into my bed. Its safe there. Its warm and I can tuck my head under the covers and pretend its only me in the world. No bills, no heartache, no flaky friends, no loneliness. Just me and the warmth I create. And lots of restorative sleep. Im going out with Mark tonight if I can summon the energy to not flake myself. Im about to take a pain pill to get a headstart on knowing how Im to feel today. Back feels weak and sore like it went through a little trauma. I think its my emotional space manifesting in something physical. Id better shower and get a move-on. Helps to pretend I didnt already waste my day in bed. Time to openly defy anxiety and get out the door. No! no tears! Whats going on, Charlotte? Ah, yes. The topic of safety out of doors is enough to make me swallow hard. Why cant I just hide out inside with black coffee and write to the world from here? Indeed. To secure a position as ideal as that, I need to work things out with all those living-in-a-community odds and ends first.

 now to plan the outing for wednesday night with Scott. downtown to the play, but before then we'll get some wine somewhere fun. blessed to have him come along, blessed to have fun out of my usual world.

 silks pajamas. by my troth, sir, i will never leave their blessings.

 i swear, i'm not obsessive. check out the new film poster that arrived from France. i had little idea how big it would actually turn out to be... dwarfing a reasonably-sized TV. . a little George and Martha alla Virginia Woolf on the right

 Up rather early as compared to recent mornings this week. It felt nice to shut off the telly around 7:30 and just heed the call to sleep. Even without a drop to put me down, I still slept another 14 hours. Less troublesome dreams at least I think so since I dont have vibrant images haunting me this morning. Another French press, another wet morning with cold feet. Ive put a call out to friends gauging their availability to indulge in a Thanksgiving Day feast at my place. My first official party, but all have been over here before. My scallop/crme fraiche/caviar appetizer is a must, along with a bottle of moet or vueve cliquot. Other than that, the only rules for folks is to avoid anything resembling traditional fare. We start at one and work our way through courses, with wines to match, until the grande finale around eight. Its our favourite holiday; no actual gifts to get in the way of the eating and community. No check in the mail again yesterday, the day after its supposed to have arrived. So the days plans will have to reflect my poverty, having more to do with laundry and football watching than grocery shopping or getting an oil change. Bills past due. I blew it this month, opting for immediate comfort over responsible spending. Too much golf on the telly to rationalize sitting in front of it this morning. Out of the warm, silk PJs and into some shitty clothes suitable for cleaning. Me and mighty Ajax on the front lines of scrubbing. (you see, Ajax is a warrior character in the Iliad . So the joke is)

 up early to make the drive out to Julian. i'll take some pictures if the medium moves me.

 so what do you all think of this? kerri has some things of mine. nothing worth too too much outside of sentimental value, but tell me... when is it appropriate to ask for things to be returned? a DVD, i think i loaned it to her (we were looking for it last night), and a book of Carver's stories that means a whole lot to me. like i said, nothing too valued, nothing i can't spend 40 bucks to replace. i don't want to pull a Mae ("you got my stuff?"). i don't want to ask. so i guess i can't have them back, right? i wished her a happy thanksgiving yesterday afternoon via text messaging. i wish i didn't care. would be so much simpler to write her out of the script completely.

 Another perfect holiday. I didnt wake up until 5pm letting the alcohol wear itself off. A quick glance around the kitchen let me know waking up was nothing to fear. Wed cleaned the place top to bottom before falling asleep. The place looked as if Id never had guests over. Save for the six empty bottles on the bar. So this morning Im wait, I woke up at sundown, so its not exactly morning. Its 6pm. Working on my coffee as usual, wondering if I shouldnt just aim to go back to sleep at a reasonable hour and skip the caffeine. Sleep is just so wonderful, and those anti-depressants make staying asleep, going back to bed once Ive stirred, so much easier. How long ago did I turn 25? Two and a half months ago? Yeah, so it took the wondrously efficient DMV that long to process my application for a new drivers license. It showed up in the mail /today/, complete with my fabulous photo taken at 16 years of age. At least I didnt have to retake the photo and risk ending up with something less cool than that mischievous smirk. I met some of my neighbors last night. A youngish guy and his maybe 8 year-old son moved in to the unit across from mine in the building next door. Really nice guy too. We chatted for a few minutes before I had to return to my guests. So this evening I brought over a piece of Bryans bee pie that we didnt eat last night. He offered me a beer, but seeing as though I just woke up, I turned him down. I wonder is he married? I havent seen a woman there, heard a female voice. I dont know why I wonder, just that I like to get a sense of where hes coming from. I suppose I could take advantage of all the awake time and get through some homework. Need to write a paper on binarism in Chanson de Roland . And do another online explication for Marthas class. And I got a pathetic B on my last paper for Susies class that Id like to avoid repeating. a B! Said it was eloquently written but lacked focus. Bah. I need to get to rereading Dantes Inferno (but first go out and buy the correct translation for the class). And rereading Morrisons Paradise . And rereading Lodges Nice Work . Key word here is RE read. Kind of a good feeling to be ahead of the game here. If only I had Paradise Lost under my belt already.

 before i retire, i have to tell you... the most beautiful woman on earth is appearing on Dave Attell's /Insomniac/ either tonight or soon. they're rerunning their London set. and there's this blond woman... oh, i think it's tonight. oh boy. there she is. "show the americans what real breast look like." a degrading line, but you should have seen this babe's face. fabulous. cat's playing with the candles again. fire extinguisher at the ready.

 Big day for this girl. By seven this evening I was yawning like the day was ending. And it is ending. I think Ive resigned to the fact that Im not going to wake up tomorrow feeling too motivated for going to school. Especially since I havent even purchased the right translation of Dante to meet my professors expectations. Quiz, shmiz. I vote for a late night watching the telly and a late morning sleeping. Come on now. I took an online exam this morning. Then saw fritz. Then back to school to work out a paperwork glitch that worked into me having to take an hour long test for my computer competency. Got home to get online and register for my classes. Then ran out to the grocery store to buy a bunch of crap for Thursdays thing. So yeah, Im sleepy. Yawning too much to keep writing. Blah.

 this is brilliant. fuck, i wish i'd sit still and write these things... Holy Matrimony What's really undermining the sanctity of marriage? By Dahlia Lithwick Posted Thursday, Nov. 20, 2003, at 3:29 PM PT Within nanoseconds of the Massachusetts Supreme Court's declaration that gay marriage is protected by the Constitution came predictions of the end of life as we know it: The president, speaking from London, warned: "Marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman. Today's decision of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court violates this important principle." "The time is now. If you don't do something about this, then you cannot in 20 yearswhen you see the American public disintegrating and you see our enemies overtaking us because we have no moral willyou remember that you did nothing," said Sandy Rios, president of the Concerned Women for America, to her 1 million radio listeners. "We must amend the Constitution if we are to stop a tyrannical judiciary from redefining marriage to the point of extinction," Focus on the Family urged in a statement on Tuesday. Extinction, no less. The institution of marriagethe one that survived Henry VIII, Lorena Bobbitt, Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpsonis suddenly going to become extinct? Do you want to know what's destroying the sanctity of marriage? Phone messages like the ones we'd get at my old divorce firm in Reno, Nev., left on Saturday mornings and picked up on Monday: "Beeep. Hi? My name is Misty and I think I maybe got married last night. Could someone call me back and tell me if I could get an annulment? I'm at Circus Circus? Roomhoney what room is thisoh yeah. Room 407. Thank you. Beeep." It just doesn't get much more sacred than that. Here's my modest request: If you're going to be a crusader for the sanctity of marriageif you really believe gay marriage will have some vast corrosive, viral impact on marriage as a wholehere's a brief list of other laws and policies far more dangerous to the institution. Go after these first, then pass your constitutional amendment. 1. Divorce Somewhere between 43 percent and 50 percent of marriages end in divorce. If you believe gay marriage is single-handedly eroding a sacred and ancient institution, you cannot possibly be pro-divorce. That means any legislation passed in recent decades making divorce more readily availablefrom no-fault statutes to the decline of adultery prosecutionsshould also be subject to bans, popular referendum, and constitutional amendment. 2. Circus Circus In general, if there is blood in your body and you are over 18, you can get married, so long as you're not in love with your cousin. (Although even that's OK in some states). You can be married to someone you met at the breakfast buffet. Knowing her last name is optional. And you can be married by someone who was McOrdained on the Internet. So before you lobby to ban gay marriage, you might want to work to enact laws limiting the sheer frivolousness of straight marriage. You should be lobbying for an increase in minimum-age requirements, for mandatory counseling pre-marriage, and for statutory waiting periods before marriages (and divorces) can be permitted. 3. Birth Control The dissenters in the Massachusetts decision are of the opinion that the only purpose of marriage is procreation. They urge that a sound reason for discriminating against gay couples is that there is a legitimate state purpose in ensuring, promoting, and supporting an "optimal social structure for the bearing and raising of children." If you're going to take the position that marriage exists solely to encourage begetting, you need to oppose childlessness by choice, birth control, living together, and marriage for the post-menopausal. In fact, if you're really looking for "optimal" social structures for childrearing, you need to legislate against single parents, poor parents, two-career parents, alcoholic or sick parents, and parents who (like myself) are afraid of the Baby Einstein videos. 4. Misc. Here's what's really undermining the sacredness of modern marriage: soap operas, wedding planning, longer work days, cuter secretaries, fights over money, reality TV, low-rise pants, mothers-in-law, boredom, Victoria's Secret catalogs, going to bed mad, the billable hour, that stubborn 7 pounds, the Wiggles, Internet chat rooms, and selfishness. In fact we should start amending the Constitution to deal with the Wiggles immediately. Here's why marriage will likely survive last week's crushing decision out of Massachusetts: Because despite all the horrors of Section 4, above, human beings want and deserve a soul mate; someone to grow old with, someone who thinks our dopey entry in the New Yorker cartoon competition is hilarious, and someone to help carry the shopping bags. Gay couples have asked the state to explain why such privileges should be denied them and have yet to receive an answer that is credible. The decision to make a marriage "sacred" does not belong to the stateif the state were in charge of mandating sacredness in matrimony, we'd have to pave over both Nevada and Jessica Simpson. We make marriage sacred by choosing to treat it that way, one couple at a time. We make marriage a joke by treating it like a two-week jungle safari. There is no evidence that gay couples are any more inclined toward that latter course than supermodels, rock stars, or that poor spineless bald man on Who Wants to Marry My Dad? There's good evidence that most of them will take the commitment very seriously, as do the rest of us. There will be more "sanctity" in marriage when we recognize that people of all orientations can make sacred choices. Good for Massachusetts for recognizing that truth.

 Still trying to work out the hold on my ability to register for the spring semester. Ive taken an upper-division computer science course thats advertised as covering both an upper-division mathematics requirement as well as the computer competency requirement. So what gives? Sure, it was my lowest grade last spring (a B, whoopty-do), but I passed it and therefore should be all set to enroll, right? I await a response from one Mary Atkins. Hurry up! I need those classes! I dont need a mad rush to the finish like some other graduating seniors go through trying to get out on time but find all the classes filled. So, I slept pretty much all day yesterday. Sleep is my favourite past time. I had a hangover, and the warmth of the bed just sucked me in. A nap that lasted five hours lead to an early night to bed looking forward to hitting the gym this morning before my classes. And yes, I got up this morning at 5am. The Elavil pills still lingering in my system, it was a bit tough to get up and shower as dawn broke. But I did it, spending two hours working out before class. An hour of cardio (that could have lasted longer had I more time), all my weights including legs, and an easy 200 sit-ups in between sets of other things to keep me diligently focused. Again, I could have done more, but getting to class was a priority. And you know? I feel fabulous today. Not like I want to go out and do anything now that school is over for the day. But I feel fit and healthy, and thats a nice thing to carry around with me. Putting on 5-8 pounds since Kerri left me added insult to injury, and I just cant accept it. I wont accept it. And even if I gain more muscle than I lose weight, Im happy that Im taking an interest in my body. If not consistently across the board. I want a better body. I want to be healthy /and/ look good. I may not workout everyday like I did in the spring and summer. Thatll only hurt my back, and I dont need pain to come into my workouts. But I will go every other day and do the complete cycle. Another thing I need for Christmas? Some LOUD headphones that I can sweat in and a radio to go with it. Or better yet, an MP3 player. But those are too damned expensive still. I brought my Bose headphones to the gym once, and Ill never do it again 300 bucks was a lot to risk breaking with all the moisture. And the risk of theft made me too paranoid. Another thing Ive wanted and havent had the guts to do until recently? Establishing a letter correspondence between me and my Dads parents. Theyre well into the 80s and not doing as well physically as Id like to imagine. But you know, theyre important to me. And ever since I moved into this place a few months ago, Ive been sending them a letter every couple of weeks to keep in touch. They should be receiving my last one today, in fact. They write back, and although the topics are trite and free of contention, I like to know were thinking about each other. After so disliking my moms Dad for so many reasons and trying to negotiate the guilt of not feeling sad that he died, this opportunity seems to weigh a lot more. I didnt just dislike Paul. I had a hard time being in the same room with him. And for good reason, Ill say in my defense. I know its poor form to speak ill of the dead (or just plain unkind), and I also have plenty of grievances with my Dads dad too (he raised some angry men) I just feel it important that I take the time to connect with them, let them into my life a little bit more, be a part of my family and its history with a little more authenticity. The letter writing is easy too when nothing serious is ever discussed. Just the weather and their aching bodies, just my schooling and plans for the future. I had to borrow money from my brother this week. My depressive habits didnt help me this month, and with a late check from my disability, I overdrew about 150. hes too kind to help me out, and of course Im going to pay him back on a regular schedule. I even offered myself up to translate any 4-D bug reports from French to English for him for nothing. Yet I feel like an ass. Money is such a hard thing for me since I lost my job at TJs. I cant wait to have a job /and/ settlement checks coming in. to get ahead of the game instead of always feeling powerlessly behind. I need to get out and do some writing today, I think. The weather sucks and its cold, but Im still up for a little autonomously-social time. Before I launch into a rant about the perils of managed psychiatric care. Before I start moaning about this Christmas and how Im questioning the quality of my gift-giving ability this year. Other things on my mind can wait. I need to eat more than a Cliff Bar, and I need to be in the world today.

 cat with the printer, his fav animate object besides me.

 Dude? Wheres my car? a lame opening question, but Ill tell you one thing. I dont remember parking last night. I dont remember a lot after the long island at the Flame, the bar Kerri has a lifetime 86 from. I went in, danced a bit, drank my one drink, and then made my way to Marks house. I took a painkiller, and that ended my nights remembrance. I took it for good reason. The alcohol wasnt helping, and quite honestly, my elbows still today feel like I was in a boxing match yesterday. Not my shoulders or my abs. Just my elbows. I need those to bring a glass to my lips, come on! Today it feels like I slept on them hyperextended. So I walk out of Marks house this morning (yes, we had sex, although I remember little of it besides demanding a condom and one other thing) with leather cuffs on my wrists and squinting eyes looking for where I parked. I did the quick glance across the street, but this is PB; no one in history has ever been able to park that close to where theyre going. And then I remembered, I parked around the corner nearest the ally to his house. I fired it up, drove him to a liquor store and then to his football buddys house for his weekly ritual of Bloody Marys and loafing in front of the tube. I thought Id be sick when he woke me up. No, he didnt wake me up. He was jerking off as quietly as he could, and /that/ woke me up. Not the motion but that horrid smell of boy spunk. Give me a girl who hasnt showered all week, and Ill still take that over that smell. Id no idea he had plans to get up and go this morning. Id have watched football with him. Well, just as soon as I got my 40 hours of nightly sleep. It all sounds like a mess of a night, but Ill tell youK I had a great time. Meaning I needed that. No crazy drugs or anything, but that has been a premise weve used to schedule time together. He kept asking me what Im doing this week, if we can get together before the holiday. And you know, Im up for it. I needed that experience of detachment (blackout, whatever) with someone I know and trust (sort of). I mean, I understand his humanity so I trust him on that level. Not everyone exposes their humanity, at a base level at least. So what about the cuffs? Well, Ive acquired some new cuffs that rival all toys Ive been lucky enough to gather together. Theyre strong, about four inches wide, double layered for more support and comfort. And with a pair of handcuffs between them, theres no getting out. What do I want for Christmas? A metal headboard for my bed. I also picked up a new belt (my cheap-ass Buffalo Exchange black belt tore in half) that I needed and went into the Crypt to buy. Yes, its actual leather. And it only cost 20-something. The cuffs were a lot more. And a small bracelet for days when I want to wear leather but cant. I met a woman while I was in there. Some straight, middle-aged chick named Donna. She and I started chatting over the ridiculously tight pants for boys and all the clear clothing. She pulled me into the back to gawk at the harnesses and dildos. She wanted one to fuck her boyfriend in the ass, so I suggested some things. Like I can do harnesses? My back is fucked up! Doesnt mean Ive no experience. So me and Donna were there discussing the Rabbit and its hurtful power. And I was trying to explain the subtler tones of rubber cocks that arent so inhuman. So we shopped together, and I waited while she tried on harnesses. Nothing like finding an ally in the weirdest of places. The boy working there was a darling too. I asked him what his resume looks like if he got a job here, and he laughed. A slightly corpulent boy with big brown eyes and some shaggy curls. He was so charming and helpful to us. I didnt walk in there thinking I would buy anything, but I left with a bag of goodies. And I want more. As soon as I can afford it all. A private wishlist. Nap time while I watch the chargers lose.

 environmentally challenged? yeah, like its just the environment thats so challenging. I guess Im envious if thats truly the case in your mind. But really Delete your blog, Kerri. Its like listening to the Emergency Broadcast System sitting out there in cyberspace. So Im wasting time here tonight IMing bryan out there somewhere, trying to out gross each other as usual. I guess I feel like I have this luxury tonight after a long day at the gym, reading Dante. Of course, I should be doing more reading, not screwing around. But I dont really care tonight. Again, I feel like going out for some eating adventure. But I realize that spending an hour doing cardio each day (yes, again. The lust is back) isnt going to go as far if I continue to eat with fun reigning as the central point of persuasion. Id still sleep with me, but I sure didnt like dating someone so involved with her non-existent diet. I felt fat. I still do to an extent, even considering my body style involves muscles, not miniature waist lines. It feels better to be fit. Not the being fit so much as the exercise helps my head. I feel safer being bigger, stronger. So maybe to bed early. Lay low, live more quietly. Only if I have no one but myself to spend the evening with.

 So, what if I dont want to go to bed tonight? I know its time, but maybe Im not ready to turn in! Goddamnit, Ive eaten marshmallow peeps this evening! Back off! So, Im hopped up on artificial Red #12 and a smart coating of granulated sugar (how novel of those folks at NewBorn Candies!). I could open fire on a crowd and have the whole country behind my alibi. Twinkie defense? Ha! Try sugar coated marshmallow! Im tipsy. But Ive done a good job tonight finishing the rewrites of my Gilgamesh screenplay. Its fucking funny, you guys. Im not used to writing humor, but I think I nailed some great bits of it in this thing. I hope so. I reread it and double over in laugher. But maybe Im not getting down on paper exactly whats in my minds eye to make me laugh like that. Even to normal folks, I think its funny. What I really want is for my teacher to vote for me to write the script for the whole story in lieu of our final. Give me something to write in my own time over an in-class hand-atrophy maker. Not into Haytons tests, but I know I can impress her given the right venue to do it. Dim cat playing with a bottle cap on the computer chair mat. Like for an hour now. Just cause it makes a sound when it slides along the plastique. Little does he know he wont be the only kitty in this house by this time tomorrow. Mark called. Things with his roommates came to a head tonight, and he needs to get out of there early. Good for him, but hes got a cat. A super cool cat who actually sits on your lap and is lovey. So yeah, I told him Id take his baby until he moves away to the east coast! Hopefully, hell let me adopt the SOB. Hows Vato going to handle it though? Ill keep them separate until I know hes here to stay. Otherwise, I can foresee as much as realizing my cat will skin little Trey alive. Both are all black. Both have claws. Either could go undercover as the other. But my blackie is a bitch, and I know it. He humps me, cutting me with his nails until I bleed. Oh, the things he could do to a cat that actually sleeps in a persons lap without begging for it. This comedian is on TV right now talking about womens orgasms. Whaaaaa? Well, thats what hes saying. He doesnt get it. Says, If youre a woman trying to figure out men and you cant get it, chances are youre thinking too much. How sad to be a man and not get a real sense of how a woman works. How sad to be on the outside like that! And how sad that you spend that much time and energy getting into the pants of something you dont even understand! Thats Why ok, indulge me here thats why!... The people of the world should all be gay! Yes, gay! Oh sure, procreate by arranged marriages. Marriage is crap anyway. Havent the straight contingent taught us as much? But sex; leave that to someone who understands the needs of your gender. Huh? Am I right? Someone once taught me when I was young, learn to do it yourself, honey. If you dont know how to do it yourself, youll never get someone else to please you. Well, YEAH. Because when it comes down to it, if your batteries are low, youre biting your pillow tonight! Only women know how to please women. even if you please the man first, theres still the obstacle of the man. How would it be if the world was set up to where you couldnt penetrate until a woman had come? Well? Well, the world would be gay, thats what. mmm just took a big bite of a peep. Wish you were me? Or my dentist, I cant decipher your smile. Like brushing my teeth with Comet. Its all the same, yo. Ooh! The package tells me this is the hold on the 50th YEAR ANNIVERSARY! of PEEPS being in existence! WOW! Youre going to go out now and collect your commemorative edition sponge-sugar partitions! Right? But today is the 70th anniversary of the abolition of prohibition in the US. (meanwhile the cat is snacking on the air until I realize he has a knot of my hair in his mouth and his throat fixed it with a little tough-love intervention) so yeah, drunks bow down! There should be drink specials about the land tonight, but you know the community is too inebriated to pay attention to matters of American history. Oh, I cant wait to see the look on this black cat face when theres a more loving cat under the same roof. Id adopt this cat if he let me. I mean it, hes Vato exactly but he has a shorter tail. And hes not as feisty. Who has coke? No, sorry. That was only a joke. Im going to bed.

 Jeff foxworthy, stand down! You know youre a drunk when You go out for donuts on a whim after 8pm. And you bring a package of marshmallow Peeps with you for back-up in case theyre closed. You know youre a drunk when Your grocery list reveals cat food, cat litter, cigarettes, and beer. Nothing more. You know youre a drunk when You can tell an old person driving a Lincoln Crown Vic from a cop in your rearview by the speed of those lights coming after you. You know youre a drunk when The recycling bin takes the help of a neighbor to wheel it into the street. And thats two feet from its resting place. Forget about the bottles that get cast in the actual trash. You know youre a drunk when The guy at the liquor store asks you how your screenplay is going. You know youre a drunk when You have to set out on a hunting expedition to find where your parked car ended up, hoping its not just impounded. You know youre a drunk when Your upper arm reads, Angela. You know youre a drunk when Your body looks like it could crush a bull, your stomach like it could cushion its fall. You know youre a drunk when Youve already gnawed off one arm, and there you have another unsavory catch in your bed the next morning. You know youre a drunk when Youve written your ex a poem who wont even answer your calls when youre sober. You know youre a drunk when You clean out your car, and you have to wheel the recycling bin around. And get out the Fabreeze. You know youre a drunk when Your blood-alcohol levels exceed your GPA. a-thank you.

 ew, it's blurry too. crap. forget it.

 THANKSGIVING DAY PICTURES! here's me putting shackles on Bryan. other photos aren't loading properly, the same hang-up that kept these from being posted earlier.

 Wow, Im actually /not/ tired this morning. I think by spending a portion of last night getting pissed at Kerri helped me to burn off some fumes. Rar! So I took a walk last night to get away from the computer and to remind myself that I have other things going on these days far more important that trying to wrap my head around a failed relationship. I just have to remember: 1, she didnt ever give me all that much, and 2, to not draw conclusions about whats to come to me in the future by what happened there. The light at the end of the tunnel. I can see the semesters end, Im finishing up the last assignments before finals. Im ready to put this semester behind me, replaced by a fresh start away from the blunders and traumas that exposed me in the past months. No more classes with Hayton or any of my current professors. I can put all of this behind me, including the identity Ive slapped to myself as someone with problemos. I dont have much to say today. I actually feel a greater impetus to leave the house for a workout! Time to toss back a darvocet and my daily doses of everything else, washed down by the crappy grocery store coffee I bought yesterday.

 Anger. You know, anger hits me in exactly two places. One, when someone has hurt me. And two? When an old hurt that I havent yet grieved properly surfaces on me. So tonight. Im angry, yes. But now that I sit still with it, Im just plain hurt. Am I that bad of a person that Kerri wont even talk to me? Did I love her so horribly that shed want to wedge such a separation? Or more likely, am I that nave to think a failed relationship should reformulate into rational communication in such a short time? Maybe its good that I never hear from her again. Makes me create a sense of anger more readily applied than if I still spoke to her (too hard for me to direct it rightfully). I feel safer when I hate her for disappearing. DISAPPEARING! I dont do that, so I dont understand. Maybe more seasoned souls get it better than I do. Ive never just walked away from someone. Even knowing its over, I still talk to the person and allow for residual shit to work itself out. How do you just walk away? Let me in on the process. Its helpful for next time, yes? What it feels like? It feels like I dont matter. That she cared so little about me, she blundered through a connection without weighing the potential consequences. She saw that it wasnt what she wanted, and she moved on like it didnt cost a thing. Thats what it feels like. Im so upset tonight that I let her have the most intimate parts of me without a receipt in exchange. Spent my last dime on an Ebay auction from someone with a shitty rating. No one to kick but myself for sending the funds to a suspicious seller. FUCK! I bought Christmas cards today, and I wanted to send her one. I still do, but I dont think Ill end up allowing it. I should be livid with this woman. Why do I let her shitty handling of us get to me so often, in so many ways? Why did I let this happen?! Her silence leaves this giant vacuum of emptiness that can only be filled with my useless hollering. I know its empty. I know she fucked it up by leaving like that. I wonder now, what the hell was I doing playing with her anyway? Shes like, /old/, and she has years of accumulated baggage I cant even begin to imagine. Were on diametrically opposed trajectories in our respective lives. Why do I sign up for such things? I knew shed do this from day one. I think I thought I was worth enough to change things for her. Thats it, I know it. Pretty crazy pressure I put on myself. That Im worth enough to make her forget/overcome a lifetime of relationship wounding. Im not angry at her. Fuck, I love her. Im angry for being alone. For the difficulty that lies in making myself vulnerable. For wanting to connect. For needing anything beyond what I alone can supply.

 It was a knock at the front door than finally woke me up. Rather, it was the second knock on the door that got me out of bed. Id been sleeping for about 14 hours, so I suppose its no surprise to most people that Id finally rouse myself, but thats not how I see it. The spell was broken, and I loathed whoever would disrupt my hibernation. I dont get out much these days. Through the technological marvels of internet communications, I still manage to get my work in to my professors. They seem to understand, those of them who know what Ive been through, my situation. Not that it has anything to do with specific events. I just dont want to go anywhere. Im afraid to. They know, and although my attendance is a dead weight on my grade, I still do the work and get the grades. But I cant leave. The doorbell rings, and I watch through the peephole to make sure they go away. UPS, mailman, solicitors, students. They come, they break the silence with their knuckles, and they stand there. And I hold my breath in fear until I see them go. Im a twenty-five year old shut-in. I keep the shades pulled tight, the windows closed, have cigarettes in the garage to avoid being seen. Im twenty-five, and I act like Im waiting to die. I dont of course. Ive felt that before, for years, but this is nothing like that. Certain things lend life a redemptive quality. Like a hot bath for an hour, watching tv or reading a book. Films, drinking, writing. These things still excite me, still move me. Wanting to die thats when you feel like disappearing in the face of the things you love. But these are all introverted experiences. Things done alone. They only redeem to a certain degree. I tried a relationship a couple months ago. I did it, I went out with someone safe, who Id known for years and fallen for since the first day I met her. It was safe because I knew her already. And safe because the ending was written into the first lines of the story. No surprises. She left back then, and she left again. She left weeks before we broke up. Vacant rooms, silent hallways, muted telephones. A heart full of fear both specific and generalized. And a dryer full of bed sheets signaling the end of the day just as it began. No surprises.

 All I want to do is sleep. Go to sleep, go back to sleep, stay asleep. So much more control over the world when its all in my semi-conscious state. Today I dreamt the perfect dream. I had all the power to control what happened, and I made the best of it. And it was the best time Ive had all week. I also dreamt that I was crying to Heather that I had lost my mind. I admitted to her that I had an entire conversation with a kitten and didnt realize this was mad until afterwards. I sat in a shopping mall alone and cried, then went back to my hotel room and fretted over not being able to lock the doors to keep people out. Strange. I look at the feelings associated with the set-up, not the literal. Loss, fear, loss, fear. Im not depressed so much as Im afraid to leave the house. I need to buy cat food and coffee, but I wont go out. Its so much safer inside, hidden from risk. Safely positioned behind the symbols of language that serve to rewrite the world I live in under my own hand, by my own designs. I didnt go to school all week again, and I dont expect to go tonight. Instead I do all my homework from this place, email it off, continue to write for myself. Writing stories. Anything to keep typing, to keep in front of my computer and retaining a sense of productivity. A sense that Im able to place the energy somewhere external, however private. Sleep. Its about 4pm, meaning that I only have a couple more hours of daylight until Ill be allowed to go back to bed. Silly, but Ive at least constructed rules about my sleeping habits. Thats about the only one though.

 Coffee at noon on a Tuesday. I began reading The Inferno last night at a bar where I had exactly two drinks before heading back home (so responsible). I think the best plan today is to continue down the same road and catch up with my reading. Lay low and work on my screenplay, take a nap if the mood strikes me, pay some bills. Maybe get out and go to the gym if Im feeling up to it, but certainly not forcing myself to. Tuxedo cat on the desk, always trying to ooze through obstacles I put in his way to prevent him from blocking the monitor. So now hes batting around the mouse, interested in anything he can move around. You know, mark called me this morning, and Im not sure what to do about it. He tends to have drugs lying around his house, and Im just no good at saying no some days. Its one thing to not have the want to go out and find it; thats easy to maintain. But when people are doing it right in front of you, thats a different ordeal altogether. Doing any drugs just screams for a breakdown on my part. I have a hard enough time coming down off of my own self-generated highs. Again, reason not to leave the house. Going out for a pint can lead to coming back to his house to get high. Timeline time: it was two years ago last week that I set sail for Italy. Two years ago today I bet I was full of hope and optimism that my stay would work out and change me forever. Right on one account. It was four years ago last month that I bid my final goodbye to Claudia. Yet I still dream about her as vividly as if I just saw her last week. Its all still so fresh in my mind. And its been five years since Ive done any meth. 5 years! You can lump hallucinogens in there too. You couldnt pay me enough to make me take acid again. Good to keep my eye on the past to mark my progress. Time to make a little today by getting into the shower and taking a look at what I want to get done today.

 Nothing like failing attendance yet getting an A on my last explication for Haytons class. She gave me a 93%!! Do you know what that means in her class? Well, it was explicating a Shakespearean sonnet under the gun of a timer. Not terribly easy. And the last one was explicating a passage from Beowulf. Back when I had my head together much more than I have had lately. Actually. You know, actually Ive been feeling pretty on top of things for the last couple of weeks. The loss of Kerri now feels like a memory, no longer a part of my present agony. And present agony seems halted by my good work in school and the light I see at the end of the tunnel therein. Only about three weeks to go! Two weeks really, plus finals. I turned in my last explication for Marthas class today when its not even due for another week. I wrote up a big checklist for things I need to do soon. And by the time I got home from the gym (weights only), I could cross out all but two items. One being the purchase of the right translation of the Inferno. I have the wrong one, so screw it. Buy the one she wants. I made calls, I paid bills, I wrote my paper for Haytons class assignment due on Wednesday. Im all ready to roll for the week. All I need now is to attend my last classes (might demerit my report card by not going) and read some tough material amounting to two whole books. Paradise Lost and Dantes Inferno. Both with so many references to a culture not my own, theyre going to take several readings and a whole lot of extraneous research to understand fully. But both are in the cannon of literature Im not willing to let slip by just barely understanding. I have a list of what I need to have read and understood by the time Im 30. What better place to learn about them than a class with a smart professor? You know, I ought to go out and eat something. Think Ill bring the laptop.

 A wonderful time at my aunt Charlottes house tonight. Im glad I went, taking Advil and Tylenol to help facilitate comfort with an angry back, a swollen ankle, and a hurt throat from the ash intake up in Julian. Most notably, I spoke with Pete, my supercool uncle, about following him and Paula to Africa this coming summer. Im so incredibly intrigued by the idea of going with them. As a graduation present, my dad has offered to give me his frequent flier miles on American. Which would easily afford me passage. And for the rest of the expense? Id ask for help for Christmas gifts. And hope I end up working by March (when Im allowed to be employed after my voc rehab) which would give me cash to save. As it stands, I make nearly nothing. I owe Chris 100/month for four months. But thats only 15% of my income. Africa. Zimbabwe first caught me when I read _Nervous Conditions_ by Tsitsi Dangarembga. A tale of postcolonial ambiguity and the fate of women in Rhodesia. A book I loved. An author I will certainly read up on more before the trip. A summary of the novel: Tambu, an adolescent living in colonial Rhodesia of the '60s, seizes the opportunity to leave her rural community to study at the missionary school run by her wealthy, British-educated uncle. With an uncanny and often critical self-awareness, Tambu narrates this skillful first novel by a Zimbabwe native. Like many heroes of the bildungsroman, Tambu, in addition to excelling at her curriculum, slowly reaches some painful conclusions--about her family, her proscribed role as a woman, and the inherent evils of colonization. Tambu often thinks of her mother, "who suffered from being female and poor and uneducated and black so stoically." Yet, she and her cousin, Nyasha, move increasingly farther away from their cultural heritage. At a funeral in her native village, Tambu admires the mourning of the women, "shrill, sharp, shiny, needles of sound piercing cleanly and deeply to let the anguish in, not out." In many ways, this novel becomes Tambu's keening--a resonant, eloquent tribute to the women in her life, and to their losses. Learning to dance the local jig. The Shona language, the mbira, the people interest me... what a trip. And thoughts of traveling to more places than one country. South Africa is so close. Jennifers sister lives there, I know. She seems to love it (and what neat kids she has!). but then theres Ghana in the west. And Botswana as a safety outlet in case the political situation in Zimbabwe gets scary. Talking to Pete. He gets things that my immediate family doesnt understand. Like cutting through the posturing bullshit our culture is predicated on. Why I wish my family would travel so they have a better understanding of the world we live in. hearing Pete talk about the reverse culture shock he went through when he returned seems to confirm exactly what I think we all sense to varying degrees. Our wealth, our consumerism, our culture is ridiculous. I need to yes, I /need/ to step out of my western-world bubble and get that. I want to understand it. I wont find a shining example of how to live a /queer/ life, but I will find a culture that exists in a more present engagement. I mentioned their plans to travel to Africa to my bestboy, Bryan. My boy who I went to London with, the boy who snores. Hes beside himself with excitement, hoping he can come too. Now, I wont sleep anywhere near him with his loud restive state, but I would enjoy his partnership. Most people I know Id never travel in such severe circumstances with. Pete and Paula seem the most desirable people for such a thing the way they accept the world as it is and go with the flow. Kerri -? Dont know how shed handle herself. Cant even begin to guess. Luis? Would get himself in trouble with the natives being a ladies man. Amy could do it, but shes too busy with work in Barbados. I really want to do this thing. I cant imagine my life ending before Ive experienced this continent. And what better circumstances than with my favourite family?

 resigning to stay in bed all day from the time i first woke up at around 6am this morning with a sore throat and a serious little fever going on. all four blankets and a down comforter wrapped carefully around me like a cocoon to prevent heat leaks, i sweat through everything. i remember groaning a lot as i stirred. and dreams of making love to Claudia in front of her husband while he slept with someone with a russian accent. ??! but i can't stay in bed today. i have to hit the road any minute now to make it to my aunt and uncle's house in lakeside. a big weekend for my car to be on the road. tomorrow it gets an oil change- hopefully not a day too late. better scrape some makeup on the acne and head out. oh, and i also dreamed that i told kerri thank you. that i take a lot away from the pain that i wanted to thank her for. am i there yet? or just craving a positive resolution?

 maybe you want the precusor emails? if not, skip down... look, we're all stressed out about your part. we've all been wondering if we'd ever get anything from you. remember weeks ago when i asked to see your progress, since we hadn't seen you around? you never sent a thing. no questions asked of us aside from the wedding house scene. which, had you read the script i sent out, you'd realise it has nothing to do with the trajectory we'd taken. that's what's most troubling - that you never asked about what the whole rewrite process was turning into. as a summary writer, you needed that to complete your part. group projects mean collaboration. and it's not fair to the rest of us to have to keep after you and fill in what you're not there to participate in. initiative means offering ideas, being proactive about your participation. you weren't there on monday either... when heather asked us to go on wednesday instead of monday. we had to tell her no becuase your part was not done yet. that's last minute, waiting until the last week to do a project that's due at the end of the semester (and assigned at the beginning). yes, your anger is justified; you've made things harder on yourself than it needed to be. i'd be angry (with myself) if i was in your position. i will discuss the matter further with the group, but as of last night i was being asked BY THEM to drop you. refocus your anger on the group, not me. or rather, yourself where the blame belongs. i'll accept none of it. with the amount of hours i've spent on this project, i'm not about to feel anything but thrilled at what hard work yields. charlotte you wrote: First of all I am asking for nothing from you. I did take the initiative. There have been plenty of classes where you have not shown up, so don't talk to me about attendence. Who said anything about last minute? Plus, I have spoken to the other group members about that meeting that I missed. I was told that I missed NOTHING and that I was incharge of the outline, which I was waitng to finish once I got your return e-mail about the "wedding scene." You act as if I am looking to get a bad grade or as if I care nothing about my grade. Don't pretend to know anything about me. And how do you figure that you have the right to kick me out when I HAVE made the effort to talk to you all? Why do you feel as if I need help. Plus your notes that you originally gave me(which don't worry, they will be returned) were no help for my part of the project, especially since it was more of a script than a outline. But whatever, you aren't the only one who is stressed out about things so don't flatter yourself and think that I need your forgiveness. Sonya

 Wow, its a chilly 48 outside tonight. I just got home about an hour ago from a homework marathon at Penny Lane to make up for a lame group member who was in jeopardy of fucking up our grade. I just wrote up ten pages in four hours of a creative rewriting of the damned Epic of Gil. Mines posted, so you can all tell me whether I did ok on it or not. No review. Just a doing the motherfucker because what she sent to us is unusable. Heres the exchange of emails, just to further qualify my rage (which is nothing compared to Achilles in the Iliad, I realize): Her shit: I never remember hearing you ask me for anything. As far as questions go, I only asked because your notes, in my opinion, did not agree with the book. I was not angry with anybody until you gave me an ultimatum of sorts with that whole "your work?" business. Plus as far as offering ideas goes, I was only told about ONE meeting that I couldn't attend. Had I known that you guys were discussing the project at other times I would have been there, but as I already said I was told that nothing happened at the meeting and I was never told anything else about any others that might occur. And who told you to tell her that my part wasn't done, had you told me that she wanted us to go on Wednesday I would have been there with bells on! And as far as where the anger goes and who I blame, I have no idea what you are talking about. I wasn't blaming you for anything and I am certainly not angry with myself. And if the group had a problem with me them why didn't they say anything when I talked to them in class??? Sonya My response: no matter. i did your part tonight. another four hours to tack onto the mountain of work i've already done. your work is unusable. you didn't even read the script to make it correspond. you did nothing, and we're all over you even being tacked on to our group. /creative rewriting/. you missed the point of the whole assignment! my notes are a departure from the text BECAUSE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE. and by the way, mine's TEN PAGES. geez. i'm mad that you took a night away from me that was set aside for other finals. don't even bother at this point! it's only out of respect for heather that i don't tell her to can you. she doesn't need this drama, and neither do we. stand up there on monday with us if you want to. we'll just pretend you were any part of it. charlotte (bitch to someone else in the group next time) Clearly stated, I think. I could mash this girls face into the sidewalk at this point. Except that I already reap the satisfaction of knowing that my prof already is aware of the situation. All I want is recognition that I did all the work. Me, the one who was in jeopardy of going out of school and into a hospital for being insane this semester. I just want heather to know I take her seriously. And Im offended when others dont follow suit. That being said, I did my best to work a deal with Penny Lane, my favorite bar close to home and the theatre were going to see The Lord of the Rings at this coming week. Im trying to get us a group discount. We are, after all, potential regulars being college students. And in masse, we could bring in a hell of a bill if all 30 of us showed up for lunch and drinks. Its worth asking for a deal. Im working on it. Im fucking tired. Ive been at the computer since noon today, and its nearing ten oclock. Youll find me on here again soon. But consider the work Ive done today, and let me off from having any more to say.

 here's all the work i did in a fury of creativity tonight. our sonya did nothing we can use. Epic of Gilgamesh: a Romantic Comedy Scene Breakdown by Charlotte Conrad Act 1 Scene One: The film opens with extreme wide angles, establishing the locale as an ancient city surrounded by flourishing forests. A voice-over introduces the scene as that of Uruk, ruled by the infamous Gilgamesh. The story is set-up, overly dramatized as an epic to outrank all other epic tales. Sweeping air shots of countryside, cut to dusty streets crowded with townspeople and livestock busily going about their day. Scene Two: Interior shot of a bar, jammed full of drunken men with their sloshing cups of mead. Loud shouts over boisterous conversation, intermingling with the inebriated songs of celebratory brotherhood. Medium shot of a certain group of men, dominantly positioned in frame is Gilgamesh in the midst of telling a bawdy story. A scuffle breaks out. Gilgamesh asserts his position as the alpha male, beating one man unconscious and galavanting out the door with a barmaid draped over his shoulder. This is not a loveable king. Scene Three: Exterior shot of the forest. Voice over eases the transition into the surrounding wilderness where we meet a trapper, busily going about his dailies. Enkidu is introduced, to whom the trapper is both alarmed and intrigued. He wonders aloud whether this creature is known to Gilgamesh, further considering whether the wildman could match his strength. A fight between the two would certainly draw a crowd. The trapper considers the monitary gain possible from orchestrating the encounter, resolving finally to go home and bring up the matter with his daughter. Scene Four: Interior of the trappers house. The tyrrany of Gilgamesh is discussed by the trapper and his daughter over a meal before the fire. The daughter has been dodging the kings advances for years, and the trapper agrees that a new top in town could do well to quiet the wiles of the leader. They decide on a way to get the two together, by hiring a prostitute to engage the beast-man and thereby get a foothold into him. Hell surely comply with the one who holds the key to his desires. Scene Five: The trapper brings the prostitute Volpina to the forest where he last encountered Enkidu. The arrangement is made, and she approaches the man. Cut to six days later where Enkidu is still working away at quenching his insatiable hunger for pleasure. Volpina is bored by this point and brings to him the proposition of coming into town to meet Gilgamesh. She offers to clean him up and make him presentable. Enkidu is afraid he wont be well received, but he acquiesces ultimately in the hope that he will gain a comrade in the king. Scene Six: The troupe of four, including the newly refined Enkidu, make their way to the town framed by a series of long shots paradying the Wizard of Oz on the Yellow Brick Road. They approach the grandeur of the kings domain and are met by a guard, a face obscured by a metal helmet. While at first they are turned away, the promise of a battle is communicated, and the guard lets them in happily. They marvel at the gaudy interior of the domacile, yet they press on eager to see the king. Scene Seven: Interior Shot of several men and women engaged in creative sexual positions, a smattering of livestock mixed in frame for effect. Gilgamesh is initially obscured from view but emerges as the knock on the door is heard. Close-up of the guard alone in frame as he inquires through a closed door whether he may enter. The door opens despite the reserve of the guard who plainly does not want to have such images etched into his minds eye. The arrival of the Wildman is announced, and Gilgamesh agrees to a confrontation. Scene Eight: The fight is on. Enkidu stands in the foreground among throngs of violence-hungry townspeople. The trapper is busily collecting bets and excitedly running in and out of frame. Horns sound as the camera cuts to the kings entrance, filmed in high speed to slow the action as Gilgamesh sheds his cloak and jabs at the air. The two engage each other, a tight scrum in the dusty ring. Both have their moment on top as the action continues with the backdrop of screams and jeers from the crowd. After much ado, Gilgamesh comes out on top. The two exchange words of praise for the other, and they embrace lovingly. The vow to partnership is pledged. Act 2 Scene One: Opening with a voice-over detailing the bonds forged between the two warriors, the two are seen in a variety of scenes together ranging from mock fights, sipping through straws the same beverage, and other modes of campy romanticism. The music cracendos as the two fall back into bed together. Scene Two: In bed, the two engage in a little pillow talk. Enkidu voices concern about his virility having been compromised since he moved to Uruk from the forests. Gilgamesh proposes a cure-all; to go out and grab their legacy by the balls. Plans are laid to go into the forest and overtake Humbaba and bring a stockpile of cedar back to the city to build a great wall, engraved with images and poetry documenting their greatness. The two seal their commitment to the journey with a kiss. Scene Three: Exterior shot of the city shows the two walking together hand-in-hand discussing the journey to come. Gilgamesh proposes they go visit the queen, Ninsun, before they journey out to Humbaba. Scene Four: Ninsun receives the two and indulges them in her prophetic guidance. She makes a great show of acceptance for Enkidus sake, embracing him and extolling his place in her sons life. She receives the wildman as her new son, gives him an amulet, and tells him to bring Gilgamesh back to her safely. Scene Five: The arming scene. Gathering together everything from the accoutraments of war to the more banal like snack foods and lubricant. The scene ends with a montage of establishing shots, showing their progress and trivial yet comical obstacles along the way as they travel deeper and deeper into the forest. Act 3 Scene One: The two stop to rest before a great mountain where they look on in enrapture awe. The two hold hands and decide to take on the journey from here in the morning. They wish each other sweet dreams and retire, spooning each other. Scene Two: Gilgamesh has a dream wherein he seizes a bull and tries to enter it. The bull bucks, and hes thrown to the ground, after which he is refreshed by someone with water. Then another dream, disjointed to the first. Theyre standing before a great mountain within a gorge. The mountain falls and bright light emerges. Scene Three: The first dream is relayed to Enkidu while revelling in their morning sleep, their bodies entwined. Enkidu interprets the second dream as well, identifying the mountain as Humbaba. They renew their resolve to see the journey to a successful end. Scene Four: Gilgamesh and Enkidu have reached the forest. Gilgamesh immediately removes his axe, a labrys, from his pack and fells the tree with smooth, measure strokes. Humbaba is heard in an ominous voice over before we see him, shrouded in ethereal (yet still not flattering) light. The battle rages on between them. Words of love and encouragement are exchanged between the voyagers. Finally Humbaba falls. ACT 4 Scene One: The throne of Ishtar is nearby, so the fellows drop in for a visit. Enkidu is busy eyeing the prostitutes who drape themselves over the steps to the temple, disappearing from the scene for the time being. Gilgamesh and Ishtar converse alone. Ishtar propositions Gilgamesh, yet hell have none of it. Enumerating her shortcomings where lovers are concerned, he turns her down with a flourish of eloquence. Ishtar rages and sends him away. The two men leave, again hand-in-hand. Scene Two: Ishtar pleads to the Gods, requesting retribution be paid to Gilgamesh for his words defaming her. Her father, to whom she pleads, materialises as a voice only. She is granted the Bull of Heaven, a source of antagonism to the two that sets out to rectify the wrongs perpetrated against her. Scene Three: The Bull of Heaven assaults the men while on a mountain path home. Gilgamesh and Enkidu join forces to defeat the beast. When its over, the two take refuge in a grassy patch and vow to continue on as boldly as before when dawn breaks. Scene Four: The two make it home amidst a great celebration in the city to commemorate their valour and bravery. Yet that night, Enkidu tosses and turns in his bed. His sleep is plagued with terrible thoughts, thoughts that foreshadow his death. Scene Five: Its now apparent that a curse has been placed on Enkidu, and he falls mortally ill. He goes through the story retrospectively, cursing all who had a hand in bringing him to this life since his days in the forest with the animals. Gilgamesh watches on in agony, a humbled giant reduced to tears. Enkidu continues to wither, and the composure of the king is dwindling along with him. He sings a song, then the wildman is lost. Act 5 Scene One: Gilgamesh is beside himself with grief. Hes drinking heavily and slurring condemning language at anyone who interrupts his mourning. Hes a mess. Hes talking to a corpse with wild eyes, in a self-induced stupor pretending Enkidu is still among the living. Finally, he is pulled away from the body in tears by a group of his cohorts. Scene Two: The king is seen at his writing desk, concocting a more rational plan to rectify the loss of his lover. He resolves to travel to the underworld to seek more concrete answers to the predicament of mortal beings. He leaves a note for his comrades in the castle, then disappears in the night to make his way to the beyond. Scene Three: Gilgamesh retraces the steps taken by himself and Enkidu on their journey to Humbabas forest. Weeping at times, he sits alone in the forest reminiscing. Renewing the value of his quest in his heart, he continues on to find his father in the underworld. Scene Four: The underworld within the caverns of the mountain. He travels in vaginal tunnels in complete darkness until finally emerging among the Gods. He finds his father, Utnapishtim. He mourns with his father, lamenting the nature of existence for mortal men. He seeks answers, and from his father he learns the nature of the mortal condition. Utnapishtim concedes to let Gilgamesh in on a secret of the Gods. Scene Five: The story of the flood is told Act 6: Scene One: Gilgamesh is cleansed in the water by his father and sent onward. While he wades in cool, clear water, he sees a serpent. He goes underwater to follow the creatures movements. There he finds a plant growing, luminous and powerful. He picks the plant and swims toward the surface. The serpent sees this act and comes towards him. It snatches the plant from Gilgamesh and swims away. Gilgamesh weeps and returns to his plans to go home. Scene Two: Gilgamesh finds no respite in the wisdom he has acquired. He continues to weep for his friend, and ultimately for himself and all of mankind. Scene 3: The Conclusion A voice-over tells of Gilgameshs destiny as ordained by the Gods. He was to be king, but everlasting life was not for him to have. This is his death scene, narrated by a voice-over to communicate what the characters cannot. His legacy is preserved and retold by the narrator, his words trailing off into the closing credits.

 here's the cast of characters, as drawn up by me. who else? Gilgamesh, Ruler of Uruk (James LeGros) Gilgamesh enjoys strong mead, violent encounters, forest logging, and puppies. Hes a vindictive, totalitarian ruler, yet democratic at heart when it comes to his adherence to the belief that all holes are created equal. Enkidu, the Wildman (Keanu Reeves) Enkidu enjoys long walks through dewy meadows, being preened beside a glowing fire, and sensual lubricants applied liberally. Hes not too bright, but he makes up for his dimwittedness by virtue of his brute strength. Dont be misled by his soft side! Underneath all that silky fur is a throbbing hunk of man just waiting to be unleashed. Rar! Fire Good! Volpina, the Town Whore (Jennifer Coolidge) Volpina enjoys long, silky fur and dinner by candlelight. A social anthropologist in her spare time, she knows what boys like. With her big, sticky pink lips and pliable limbs, shell show you a good time. Boys, dont bother trying your wiles on this woman; shes been around. The Trapper (Don King) Always on the lookout for a profitable sparring, he sees gold bricks with the pairing of mighty Gilgamesh and his underdog discovery, Enkidu. Rather than bother his little mind with the fate of Ukuk, he focuses his attention on collecting the admission fee from the townspeople to see the big fight between the brutes. Daughter (Wanda Sykes) A shrewd mistress of the forest, theres no bullshit going to pass this check stand. She plays for the other team, and that being said has even less interest in being harassed by Gilgamesh. Break out your wallet chains for the trappers daughter! Humbaba (Wayne Knight, a.k.a. NEWMAN on Seinfeld) Hi, Im Humbaba! Im a Pisces. I like Chihuahuas and Chinese Noodles! (shitty B-52s ripoff) Hes the Nature Divinity assigned by Enil to oversee the cedar forests where the gods live. He also enjoys gardening and feng shui. Utnapishtim (Charlton Heston) Utnapishtim survived the great flood sent down by Enil and still today he enjoys morning lapswims at his immortal palace within the realm of the Gods. Hes an avid skier and spends his summers in the Hamptons. Ishtar (Heidi Fleiss) Ishtar is the goddess of love, procreation, and war. Living among throngs of both male and female prostitutes, she has a longstanding history of loving and leaving em. Hunky Gilgamesh catches her eye, but hes no breeder nor will he have any of someone with such a reputation. Vengeance and spite fuel her fire. Yall dont want to cross this bitch.

 here's the pitch, as drawn up by who else. Charlotte Conrad Morgen Spear Kelly Hovis Hayton LTWR310 Fall 2003 The Epic of Gilgamesh: A Romantic Comedy Pitch to the Good People of Comedy Central Gay culture is in the mainstream. And lets be honest, male homosexuality has a long history of comic success. Never more so than it is these days with the recent success of TV hits like NBCs Will & Grace and Bravos Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. Theres a genre here thats palpably hot. Building from these landmark hits, we propose a twist on the genre. Gay comedy is ready for the next step. Imagine Spartacus but intentionally funny. Were ready for a period piece with an edge that corresponds to the tastes of the times. Its the ancient Epic of Gilgamesh transposed on the template of Comedy Centrals original comedy films like The Independent with Jerry Stiller, Knee-High P.I. and The Hebrew Hammer. This is edgy comedy with a literary framework. Were calling the film, The Epic of Gilgamesh: A Romantic Comedy. The tale does more than hint at the homoerotic nature of the primary relationship. We aim to bring that aspect to the forefront of the story and exploit it for all the titillation it can deliver. Starring in the role of the ruler of Uruk is James LeGros who youll remember from the classic independent film Living in Oblivion. Hes proven his capacity for acting like a self-obsessed ass. This is a character trait essential to fleshing out the Gilgamesh character, who you may recall from your studies as being a remarkably unlikable ruler. The costar for this picture has a very unique role, unparalleled in film history. This companion of Gilgamesh is the Wildman of the Forest, Enkidu. A man comprised of equal parts, ape and human. Hes endowed with animal good looks yet without the brain to do much on his own. This brings to mind, of course, the best candidate to take on such a role; Keanu Reeves. And with his rumoured bisexuality, the choice will lock in a whole bi-curious contingent to our proposed target demographic. Lesser characters in the film include a town prostitute, a trapper and his daughter, the goddess Ishtar, and a host of others. Now, weve thought long and hard about proper casting for these roles, and were quite happy with our ideal matches. The town prostitute we patterned after a famous character in another acclaimed film, Fellinis Amarcord. Volpina is the town whore who is summoned by the people to heal the ails of a troubled man hiding in a tree. Shes strangely attractive, yet exudes more disgust and disease than traditional beauty. Our projected casting decision has focused on Jennifer Coolidge of Legally Blonde and Best in Show fame. With her big features and ease in playing women with a simple mind, she fits the bill seamlessly. The trapper is a man with a mind for sparring. He sees the potential brawl between the headstrong Gilgamesh and the brutish Enkidu. Rather than let the matter settle itself on its own, he manages to pose the two in opposition to exploit the profit potential. To heighten the characterization of the trapper, weve proposed the role to be filled by none other than Don King. No one loves a good brawl more than the man with the frightened hair. His daughter needs to be a woman who can both live under the thumb of a father like Don King and have the appropriate attitude to succeed in the continual dissing the lord of Uruk. Who better than the comic sensation, Wanda Sykes? Her role as the Davids neighbor in Larry Davids genius comedy hit, Curb Your Enthusiasm, underscores the no-bullshit persona she brings to the table in her stand-up routines. She may cost as much as Keanu to get signed onto the project, but her name carries far more weight than any of these actors. The lesser characters are all paired with actors not far from the personalities needed. To match their roles in the epic, wed ask that Heidi Fliess play the role of the prostitute-loving Ishtar. Humbaba, the rather large God assigned to protect the Cedar Forest would be perfect if played by Seinfelds Wayne Knight. Utnapishtim, the survivor of the great flood, is a man of great wisdom. For that role, weve proposed to offer the position to Charlton Heston. Were aiming for the same demographic as you might expect from Comedy Central, the 18-25 year-old male contingent. In addition to this crowd, were secured a queer crowd that will eat up anything produced with a gay theme. Theyll watch anything that reflects even a scrap of their identity, right? Well of course want to advertise in the Advocate and local gay rags that circulate among that community. The spots are cheap, and theyll go a long way to reach an audience. The stage is set; audiences today are seasoned to receive queer storylines as long as theyre done with humor. We need to hire a team of experienced comedy writers to flesh out the concept. Visually, our aim is to bring a less expensive Julie Taymor to the project to paint the film in tones of creative fantasy. And finally, the prospect of transferring the film to DVD format following the original release will secure continued income as cult followers fight to keep a piece of this movie-making history.

 Ravenous hunger. Ravenous. What else can I eat? I just got home from an hour at the gym, meaning completely to make it to class straight from it. But this hunger. Thats the thing about working out so much; food means more than mere satiation. I could eat 100 pieces of hamachi right now So I had to come home to stuff something in my mouth. Toasted bread dripping in peanut butter, eaten so fast I inhaled the crumbs and coughed. But its not enough. Although I have some raw materials here to make a shit-load of thai food, I dont know if I have the patience to wait for it to cook. Again, my basest emotions are keeping me from school. Usually, its fear. I feel a little crappy about missing the last meeting for Susies class. Especially since I wont be able to complete the course evaluation to let loose on how /little/ any of us learned in the class. So instead, Im spending the night finishing up our group project composing the proposal (ooh, dj vu!) we need to send in to heather. Demographics were aiming at, tv/film company, etc.) my group the girls from whom I stole that 12Steps nonsense. Oh, and that reminds me. I laughed today in heathers morning class when we were talking about the differing views between those who believe were predestined to have a certain life experience and those who believe in individualism. Someone raised their hand to complain about people who always say, Everything happens for a reason. I silently applauded her next assertion: Thats so irresponsible! yeah. Someone in mind right now who uses that adage to justify her behaviour. Its a cop-out. So yeah, I both laughed and got angry all over again this morning. Time to work the project.

 yet before i put myself down for a nap, there's something i wanted to steal from Morgen's blog (that she herself borrowed from another). here it goes: the 12steps (a variant of the Bill W brainwashers) Step One: The Call of the Drink It beckons to you, you simply answer it. It sounds like a good idea, and you decide you will not got too far. The call of the drink typically sounds on a weekday, normally on a Tuesday or Wednesday. The call precedes the "Are we going for sick?" debate. Step Two: Economics If funds are low, and you don't have an entire paycheck to blow, you must decide to do the Poor Man's Drunk (i.e. drinking on a completely empty stomach) or if there is some possibility that you can con others in to providing it for you. The high male ratio in the Crumpet/DPW drinking group tends to cramp the style at the bar. Free drinks are few and far between. Alternative options include: stealing other friends' Malibu rum and Bailey's, and hanging out with the likes of Sean Butler (only to be used in extreme emergencies.) Step 3: The Suitable Drinking Partner Finding the appropriate drinking partner proves to be exceedigly difficult. You must not choose a beginner, and you must not choose two girls who will throw ice at you while you are face-down on the couch, causing you to cry. Crumpet and DPW choose the long-term route, picking out victims and training them with a marathon course of pubs and bars. Step 4: The Clink of the Ice, the Crack of the Tab The first sip that holds beautiful promises, the initial lick of the lips that christens the inebriation that lies patiently ahead. During this step, the last flattering photos will be taken with the camera that you have vowed will chronicle the entire evening. Makeup is not yet smeared; words not yet slurred. Savor the next hour, for this is when you become inordinately smart, eloquent and charming. The next 8 steps can follow in rapid succession or may occur simultaneously Step Five: Sad Reminiscing The most worthless step of the entire twelve. It usually concerns relationships and can lead to DWIs - Dialing While Intoxicated - which entails calling everyone you ever dated, since you are convinced that it is a completely excellent idea. Known by Crumpet and DPW as the "Hizzy-fit Step," it is a particularly hideous level, where one may get stuck for the remainder of the evening. This step is especially lethal to Tylers, Witchfaces, and those known to leave several voicemail messages in an increasingly drunken voice. Step Six: Wanting to Get Naked and Asking Strngers to Do the Same Usually done after the DWI has already taken place, and the drinker has been rejected again. In Rummy-land, this step is often initiated by Crumpet, and usually involves selling DP Witchface to the highest bidder. In extreme circumstances, this step will involve gathering several women in the ladies' bathroom at a sports bar to talk about (and flash) boobs. Step Seven: Math You start figuring out how many hours it will be until you have to be fully functioning again. Ex: "I can sleep fifteen more minutes if I don't take a shower." Or, how many hours it will be until you can drive again. Outcome: work hangovers, sleeping with cocktail straws and money in your bra, and the Walk Of Shame. Step Eight: "It's Ten 'til One" Inventory A quick assessment that no matter how much liquor you have, it will not be enough and you must get more, and NOW, because it is the most important mission of your life. If you don't have non-drinkers in your Idiot Girl group, this is where you will get screwed over. Solutions: past answers to this perplexing question include giving a "sober" Sam the car keys, and asking Paulino to go buy Guinness. Step Nine: Let's Get a Snack, Too A journey to the drive-thru, because you are much to drunk to go to a restaurant, though you are still okay to drive. Purchase $20 worth of food that will most likely reappear in an altogether different form before sunrise. During this step, cold chicken begins to sound like a heavenly food. There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with piling into Rebecca's car with Lola, and searching for an AM/PM while in your pajamas. Step Ten: I Love Being Me You are witty. You begin feeling beautiful, sexy and thin. You really want to be naked now, and just about everybody is looking good. You will not think twice about sticking your tongue down a stranger's throat in a crowded place. You may also feel the needto tell assorted people that you love them, and this is a good indication that you should probably go home. The step where you make a move to kiss Morgen on the cheek and completely miss. The step where you are convinced the people you have just met will be your best friends for life. The step where you make plans to go to a strip club with your new best friends. Step Eleven: Invisibility You believe that you are invisible and can do things that will bear no witness. The invisibility step is the cousin to the Drunk Whisper, where no matter how loud you yell, the only person to hear you will be the owner of the ear you are shouting into. Need to throw up in Step Eleven? Open the car door, the parking lot will do just fine. No bathroom? No problem! Step Twelve: The Complete Loop You lose the ability to communicate, with the exception of nodding your head. Also evaporated is the decision-making process, all of your money, the use of your limbs, and quite thankfully, consciousness. Step Twelve is the reason you will awaken on the tile in the hall, be unable to answer simple questions like "Are you hot?" and find bruises on your body in the morning. *as ripped off of Larie Notaro, and edited with Rummy experiences.

 Well, again I didnt want to get out of bed this morning. Even made it so far into the decision making process that I got up, turned off my alarm, turned on the water in the shower then turned off the water and crawled back into bed. But alas, the worrying mechanism in my head prevented me from going back to bed. I got up, and I went to class. I feel bad for Martha I havent wanted to go to her class in a long time, and Im like a lot of people. Im planning to sleep this afternoon instead of going since all I have left for her is a final paper on a topic of my choosing. Same with tonights class. Just have to pick a piece to write about and submit it by late next week. So, yes. Ill sleep. I have things to laugh about (lecture in Heathers morning class), but Ill save them for later.

 why this is fucking up my writing with the wrong symbols is a mystery. all these ?: things everywhere in place of normal punctuation. ??

 Love me. For one, I got up this morning with a head full of sleep after only 10 hours and made my way out of bed and into the shower before I could decide not to make it. I went to all my classes, albeit with the help of darvocet since I did something wicked bad to my back at the gym yesterday. during sit-ups, and no I didn?t read the sign too well; I continued on through my whole routine. I met with heather hayton in between classes to buy a ticket to go with her to see the new Lord of the Rings movie that comes out on Wednesday (with the class?K this time no friends invited to ruin it for me). We spoke, and I only choked on my words once, faltering as I explained to her some anecdote about traveling and the joys of being isolated from reality and what that does to one?s writing. It was a tidy conversation full of smiles, talk of shared passions and interests, and most importantly, no mention of past ills that took the forefront of our conversations before. Before I left, she gave me back a quickie paper I?d written as well as the midterm she let me retake since it was administered the day after the Kerri debacle. Well, you?ll never believe this, but I got a 95% on my midterm. A heather hayton midterm, mind you. The hardest prof in the land. And the paper? Well, it sucked (I hadn?t even read the material thoroughly by the time I submitted it), and I still earned a 9/10. ha! It made my day, and I told her so. I wasn?t going to look at the scores in front of her lest I earned a sub-average mark and would have to react to it right there in her presence. So she says, ?You can look at it. You did fine.? So what I?m expecting is a low B or something. Who knew? I let out a "holy shit!? as I scanned the bluebook for the red ink with the circled "95! and the words "very good job!" in trademark professor script. So yeah, I did good today. AND I went to the gym after my last class, AND I took it easy with a short but energized 20 on the elliptical and only 100 sit-ups. Nothing hard on my already injured back. In fact, my whole body is damaged. My knees hurt (I thought I might not make it to my car from the gym), my ankles both swelled up, my back, even my old broken toes ached like mad today. Yet, this is what I get for getting back into shape. It comes with the consequences of feeling more pain, thus the painkillers have made their way back into my repertoire. And I found out last night via an email that I will not have to take the final in class for Martha's British Lit II course since I have an A in the class going into it. For those of us who have done that well, she?s letting us do a take-home paper. I know I nailed an A on my last explication for her class (not graded yet), and my last one for Hayton says I scored a 93%!! So you see, I rule. I just can't wait to hand over my screenplay to heather next week on Monday morning. I can't wait to show her how good it is, can't wait to imagine her having it and laughing. I want laughter between us, not frantic tears and anxiety. I like her, you guys. I respect her, I think she?s hot, and I have something to prove. What are you gonna do? :) I thought today I'd reward myself for the good work. (and good deeds! I was walking behind heather to my second class and saw ahead of time that her hands were full, so I ran to the door in front of her to open it. Yes, that's something I'd do even if she looked like a she-monster) Since I'm to see the latest and greatest of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, what this class is structured around re: references to epics, I thought I'd sit my butt down on the couch with some beer and watch the other movies. Well, I only have one of them here, and god knows I'm not good for sitting down for longer than one 3-hour film. But yeah, it'll help me to understand the third one and make some sense out of it after the film when we all go out to discuss it. Oh yeah! So, we?re all going out after the film to get a beer to talk about it and pat ourselves on the back for our fabulous efforts this semester! /so/ up my ally. I?m glad we?re all able to relax together after the film. And having some liquor between us, I?ll be able to do what I?ve intended since I fell apart this semester; to tell heather, from a I?m-doing-so-much-better-now position how much I appreciate the patience and consideration she showed me. She didn?t have to do that, and I know it. Speaking of her classes, I have some homework to do. Perhaps before I settle down into the movie-watching. She has asked us to review Dante?s Inferno and with that to construct a hypothesis on what circle of hell we would expect to find ourselves in and why. Fun, huh? Well, since I did rename my blog after that very same topic, I?m already halfway there. It?s fun to out yourself. Or maybe it?s just me. I like to take credit, top billing, for my sins and transgressions. To work! And then, to the store for smokes!

 Its too early in the night to warrant a goodbye. Yet all I want to do is crawl back into bed and assume the position of a supine back surgery victim and let it be. Tonight I got the worst back spasms since the spinal fusion, a space just above my new tattoo I got to mark the spot of worst pain. Felt no less like a knife being poked in and out of the area. I screamed a few times, right into the open window beside me. Even the stupid cat took pause (paws, hahhaha) to watch me writhe. Another pain pill, and I feel better. Stupid and useless, yes. But no screams. Isnt that what the surgeon advertised before my disk declamation? Well, Im feeling a bit sleepy after all the trauma and medicinal drink and drug. If Im to make it to class at all tomorrow, Id better get to sleep now. Before 8 so humbling.

 check out the cast of characters plus personality sketches of the Gilgamesh adaptation, written today by me... urlLink here .

 for those of you who are well-versed in the tale of Gilgamesh, these images should please you: Gilgamesh, Ruler of Uruk (James LeGros) Gilgamesh enjoys strong mead, violent encounters, forest logging, and puppies. Hes a vindictive, totalitarian ruler, yet democratic at heart when it comes to his adherence to the belief that all holes are created equal. (NO IMAGE YET) Enkidu, the Wildman (Keanu Reeves) Enkidu enjoys long walks through dewy meadows, being preened beside a glowing fire, and sensual lubricants applied liberally. Hes not too bright, but he makes up for his dimwittedness by virtue of his brute strength. Dont be misled by his soft side! Underneath all that silky fur is a throbbing hunk of man just waiting to be unleashed. Rar! Fire Good! Volpina, the Town Whore (Jennifer Coolidge) Volpina enjoys long, silky fur and dinner by candlelight. A social anthropologist in her spare time, she knows what boys like. With her big, sticky pink lips and pliable limbs, shell show you a good time. Boys, dont bother trying your wiles on this woman; shes been around. Humbaba (Wayne Knight, a.k.a. NEWMAN on Seinfeld) Hi, Im Humbaba! Im a Pisces. I like Chihuahuas and Chinese Noodles! (shitty B-52s ripoff) Hes the Nature Divinity assigned by Enil to oversee the cedar forests where the gods live. He also enjoys gardening and feng shui. Utnapishtim (Charlton Heston) Utnapishtim survived the great flood sent down by Enil and still today he enjoys morning lapswims at his immortal palace within the realm of the Gods. Hes an avid skier and spends his summers in the Hamptons. Ishtar (Heidi Fleiss) Ishtar is the goddess of love, procreation, and war. Living among throngs of both male and female prostitutes, she has a longstanding history of loving and leaving em. Hunky Gilgamesh catches her eye, but hes no breeder nor will he have any of someone with such a reputation. Vengeance and spite fuel her fire. Yall dont want to cross this bitch.

 Oh, the indulgence. I have time now. Time to fuck around on the internet, time to clean my world from top to bottom, time to write Christmas cards to loved ones and wrap pressies. I can do whatever I want, so long as it doesn’t cost anything. Speaking of cards, guess who I received one from today?! ANNA! Ms. Marchant from Italy, my super-duper crush from my Italy life. Oh… I’m still smitten with her. I sent her one too. She always gets postcards when I leave the country. I like having her in my back pocket as a distant pal. She’s still sailing, going with her man to Croatia and Greece where they won a regatta. Ugh, she’s cool. I sent her copies of those luscious pictures of me and Kerri, plus one of me all sunburned and happy in Barbados at the pool bar, half submerged in water and loving it. What I really want is for Anna to reciprocate so I can finish that alter I’ve been working on. I negotiated the maze that is Palomar Hospital this morning to deliver a card to Ivy, a colleague of mine who’s in CCU from a near-fatal car crash. No, I don’t know her. It’s just the humane thing to do. Is the sudden vacancy of Christmas break going to wreck me? Most people look forward to vacations from school. I worry. I need that structure. I need that backbone of stability to steady my hand. “Substitution, Ref!? Bring in a replacement distraction. Any suggestions? Need to start stalking someone, I guess.

 Who knew? I actually feel human. Not anxious, not manic, not lusting to tune out to control my mood. Sure, driving home from an alcohol-free dinner with the folks tonight I was having gentle hallucinations involving moving asphalt and imagined pedestrians. But I feel ok. Good even. I feel like I imagine normal folks feel. Save for the fact that today I can’t write with the same fluidity I’m used to. Can’t get into the zone where the words pour out without consideration and still seems eloquent. As evidenced in the paper I’m trying to write for the adorable Ms. Heather. It’s too casual, lacking that detached intellectualism that I pride myself on for academic papers. Linking elements of an epic to their practical application in today’s world of war politics. A concept ripe with possibilities, but I can’t get my head around it to do it justice. So instead, I’m putting down the paper writing for the night in favour of a bit of ComCent reruns of The Man Show and Insomniac. Turn on the heated blankie in the bed and prepare to investigate the sleep allowance of new meds. All these current events propping up in my consciousness begging me to launch on a rant, but I don’t have the time or the will to commit myself to the departure. Wait until Monday afternoon when the last silly paper is printed and out of my head. My mind is soft, and it feels great. No nervousness, no irrational worrying. The gentle disposition I’ve longed for.

 i have a lot to say about the day, but i have a paper due by noon tomorrow that i haven't begun yet. so i'll just send you this: a new t-shirt on its way for christmas.

 Well, now I really have to stop drinking. No, I didn’t have another marathon of beer last night to make me say this (again). This time I’ve been slapped with a dangerous chemical side effect warning from my –new- psychiatrist. I’m not going to die if I drink. I just can’t drink like a hobo each and every day. How on earth can you diagnose someone with a mental illness in a thirty minute sit-down? This time it’s been refined to Bipolar II. This time I’ve been prescribed psychotropic drugs for it. Lamictal, Buspar, two other kinds of pills I can’t remember the names of without them sitting before me. in addition to the 300mg of Effexor and the Risperdal that made me gain weight. No more Elavil comas though; I’ll have to sleep excessively by my own power now. I have to say that I’m worried. Not about how to manage life without liquor. It’s a real cramp in my lifestyle that I’d like to let go of. The fear is coming from the fact that I’m going to be on a lot of drugs, a lot of different and heavy drugs that I’m not used to. The last time I took a psychotropic? Depakote. I started crying, watching black shapes emerge from the wall and coming after me. I have two more papers to write before finals are over. Is this a good time to be messing with my chemistry? I’m scared. I hate being crazy. For how I feel, the lack of control. And the measures I must take to pose as normal as a lot of other people. At least this may help with the anxiety, the despair, the cutting. The generalised pain that makes the day weigh so much.

 i just realised how long it's been since i've posted with visual aides. so here...

 so i started a new blog. somewhere else. and then i thought i'd just go ahead and post what i'd written here. however much i love to have the ability for folks to post comments to my entries, i like this format best. here's some of what came out on sunday:

 So, Im thinking I should move my blog over here. Im self-conscious about the girl having access to my innermost, now that I have no access to her. Fucking kerri Im still quite upset about the breakup, the terms not agreed upon, the silence. Feeling a bit like the Burgess Meredith character in that Twilight Zone episode, after the world was destroyed by a nuke. Nothing but rubble and silence. I came home trashed last night. Trashed but happy. Im thrilled to have met these girls, Morgen and Kelly. Sweet things with brains. Its fun stuff, and I dont feel like a mental case or that I have to hide the fact that I am one around them. Im so picky about who I spend my time with, if I go out at all. Success; I approve of the new additions to my circle. I suppose I would have been blogging more had I not added house guests to my pre-finals weekend. Lovely having them here, yet I feel a touch hesitant to go out and play when I have so much on the stove right now. Then again, Ive never been one to turn down a daily session of irresponsibility, alone or with folks. If I can spend the day with beer in my hand whilst doing homework, I can manage extended gym time and doing my drinking actually /with/ people. Speaking of which, I spilled a beer on my oh-so favourite keyboard the other day, rendering the /? key sticky. Just swatted the thing right off my desk and into my awaiting lap where the action happens when Im writing (besides the arousal). Damn! Guess its time to charge the company for a new CORDLESS one. Love that perk. A quiet day. Im stalling, fending off the urge to sink back into homework mode. Thus the pursuit of a new web address to do my daily blogging. Seriously though, I shouldnt have mentioned the Kerri thing. cause now I feel like launching into a rant. Right after I have a cigarette. Much better. Having healthy people living here makes being alone (without the self-inflicted guilt) all the more ripe for smoke breaks. And masturbation; had to jerk off at some point. So the woman. Kerri. Its still fresh, this lingering wound. I fell in love with her. Why that fact was the impetus for her departure is beyond me. well, its not I could foresee the problems that would incur. Beside the fact that shes 6 years clean and Im a raging alcoholic. Beside the fact that Im a writer and she hardly reads a word nor can put two words together in writing. And yes, shes 41 and Im 25. but the sex! Gaddamnit, I miss her naked body in my bed. Making love to her. Watching her back arch when she comes. Her fabulously sexy voice and those tattoos I loved to touch. Letting my hands speak to her, as she put it. She loved my hands, my touch and I miss having that appreciation, a place to be my truest self. For giving pleasure, for having a space to be loving. Im so not over this yet. I could afford myself the pleasure of crying this morning/afternoon, but I have to keep composed for when company returns from breakfast. I hear nothing from her. I know, I know my falling in love with her scared her. Shes trying to put me out of her mind so she doesnt have to deal with reciprocal feelings. But didnt we share something together? Wasnt our connection amazing? Do I deserve to be punished this way for loving too much? Or rather, for being honest with my passion and letting it manifest in words and action? The place I let myself go with her Im not good at trusting people to experience me with that degree of raw intimacy. I at once curse myself for misguiding my trust and feel blessed for having that memory of experience tucked away in my back pocket. I take away knowing how satisfying it can feel, loving and being loved and I take away a heart that aches a lot more than cuts on my body. I had my heart broken already. Im still not over /that/ one, however long it has been since I left her. But I left her. Ive never been dumped before. Sure, Ive been with someone entirely unavailable. But I signed up for it, falling for a married woman with kids. And I think the reason why that still lingers is because she too got to have a piece of me that no one previously had access to. Somehow putting her behind me, Claudia, means putting that part of what went on somewhere on a shelf as well. 30 Helens Agree: Love Hurts (hell break your heart, honey!) enough. Im going to get stupid again if I let myself entertain these thoughts of pain for too much longer. Im damaged goods, but if I can learn to stop thinking about myself like that Ill be much better off. Its not denial; its self-preservation, something I need more experience bolstering rather than throwing out the window. I wanna beer. A little hair of the dog to get my mind back on track. Or off this track, whatever. Im not done writing. Its going to be one of those days.

 Got to figure out how to alter this pages appearance. Two French presses and a freshly cracked beer for breakfast, and Im all ready to roll. Driving out to the liquor store, I felt like I spent the night on coke or something similarly bad for me. spaced out, thinking compulsive thoughts that go nowhere, unsure of my physical abilities to react or interact with the world outside my skin. Yawning, telling me I should still be asleep to let the alcohol of last night wear itself a bit thinner. Looks like the gym isnt going to happen today. And you know, Im already hulking a bit from all the weight lifting and push-ups. Think Ill let the kids go it alone. Still yawning, yet I cant sleep with house guests. Im lost. Two words that keep intruding into my head today. Im lost for no other reason that the disorientation caused by Kerri. Ok, I know I said Id stop talking about this, but Ive begun and I cant stop until its exhausted itself. Two scenes playing out in my minds eye over and over again. One: That day in the first week that I moved into my new house. I called Kerri, still just an old friend (haha, old) that Id recently run into at Pride for the first time in 6 years. We been to the beach together, talked to catch up. I invited her over to see the place, and there she came. Rumbling up in her motorcycle, parking in my vacant garage. Her helmet in her arms and a sexy swagger over to me for a hug. We laid on the fresh carpet looking through lesbian porn (I had that much moved in) and talking about the vagina monologues. I suppose it was a little suggestive on my part looking back, but I wasnt even thinking about touching her. She stayed for two hours, I remember, before she got up to leave. And there, standing in the mouth of my open garage, she moved to kiss me. I felt her breath, her energy like a storm cloud embodying all the potential of a lightning strike. And then we kissed again. Deep, lusty kisses as I pulled on her wallet chain to bring her body closer to mine. One hand on her chest to feel her heartbeat, the other holding the warmth emerging from our hips pressed together. It was magical, sexy, and right there in front of my new neighbors who afterwards went straight into their house and shut the door. She got on her bike and started the engine, looking hungrily into my eyes. I told her, Dont leave now, not like that, with a big grin on my face. Ill be back, baby, she responded with a serious intention and a smile. She backed up her bike, that thundering engine between her legs. A moving vibrator. Nice. And then she was gone. I walked back into my empty house and gave an hoot of pleasure. Id just come out to my neighbors, and I just kissed miss kerri-lou toepfer. The woman I had a crush on when I was a drugged up teenager. The woman who I made out with on the floor of a friends apartment when I was 17 and housesitting. Kerri. And the other scene I keep going back to? That last night in my garage. Im such a sweetie, Id set up chairs atop a spare stretch of carpet given to me by my parents from their swanky joint in Julian. Just for us, two chairs so we could have post-coital smokes together in the warmth of the indoors. I got to taste her mouth for the effort; she was touched that I set that up for us. (God, this feels better being able to talk about this stuff without the worry that shes going to pop in and read it. What freedom!) Id just set it up to. Right before the break-up. She was pulling away from me for weeks, withholding sex in favour of getting to know each other better. Code for rethinking how ready I am for a passionate relationship. The feelings she had for me were scaring her, she said. And my drinking, she went on. The drinking was scaring her. I challenged her sobriety, the bubble of safety she lived in. The beer breath she used to laud me for, telling me in hushed, husky tones in between kisses how sexy she thought it was. It used to turn her on. I offered to not ever drink in front of her if she needed that, and she told me it didnt matter. In fact, it turned her on. But there it was. She was preparing to leave. And I felt the torrent of painful tears culminating in my chest and hands, that painful ache. Id lost her, and she was blaming my drinking. Not so much her own emotional ambivalence. Me. my behaviour. I got up from our cosy spot in the garage. I spoke only these words. I touched her head with my hand and said, Im going to go to bed now. The only thing I could think to say to end the pain that was being issued to me. I left her in the garage, walked upstairs to my room and curled up in the fetal position on top of the covers and wept silently. Silently because I wasnt sure I felt safe to show grief in front of someone whod just proven her trustworthiness. Then I got up. It wasnt safe to mourn like that. So I turned on the shower and stripped. Weeping, I held the wall while the water warmed. Then I stood under the head and cried openly as the hot water washed my tears down the drain. I may be dramatizing it with language, but the moment was as powerful as words can say. The attention to drama is not for nothing. And when Id had enough, maybe ten minutes later of my baptismal cleansing alone, I got out, toweled off and put on fuzzy pants and a wife beater. I walked back downstairs to see if she was still in my house, and I was met by silence and an unlocked front door signaling she had left. Thats the second scene I cant stop recalling. Shoot. Writing that encapsulated quite a rollercoaster of emotions. Beginnings and endings. Like Fritz said in therapy, Im not too good with endings. I need another cigarette. And no, Im not done yet.

 and then theres one more scenario this writing is reminding me of (I hope youll all understand and indulge me in this activity, this remembrance) One particularly good night together, we were after each other, soberly intense yet as primal as animals. I had my hand on her chest just above her breasts, feeling her heartbeat but more importantly pressing on her heart-centre. It was spiritual, transcendent. She finished rather quickly with my mouth on her a moment earlier. God, I could just live between her legs. A beautiful body. So luscious. We were lying together when she descended upon me. I was so aroused, my legs were quaking in response to her first touch. Almost immediately, I could feel my uterus contracting, such a grateful uterus. With each movement of her hands inside of me, I came. Beautifully and without end, I came. Those hands. Kerri the mechanic, the chef. My Kerri-Lou. I completely lost myself with her, looking deep into her eyes as I continued to come again and again. I was in love, you guys. I still am. I dont let just anyone have me like that. I love her. However much Im crushed that she walked away from that. What did I do wrong? Ok, so its not about that. But Im telling you; this was the end-all and be-all, however short lived the relationship proved to be. The sound of her voice when she cried out with pleasure. I miss that. her playfulness singing along to music in her car. I miss that too. Her mannerisms, the way she spoke. The scar on her abdomen from her hysterectomy, disrupting her completely flat little tummy. Those tiny breasts under her wife-beaters. Those toes all cutely painted in iridescent purple. I shake my head to myself as I look over what Ive written. Im hurting. I cant believe I finally conspired with someone to create such joy, and now its gone. I need a smoke. Need it.

 how's this for hard work?!

 my knees are throbbing. to save my back, i lifted "correctly" and now i'm paying for it. what did i do this afternoon? i laid enough stones to cover half my backyard. it was fun fitting them together - they're irregular in shape, so i had to puzzle it out. looks great, however only half the yard is prettied up from the dirt floor i was left to start out with. i'm going to load my camera with batteries and take a photo. you'll be impressed. i'm going to be hurting tonight.

 there's this weird guy i met through school's LGBT named Mani. i just had to post this incredibly odd email he sent out to all of us: Dear Lgbt-mates: I don't think I will be in-town on Dec. 23, but I will be thinking of you. Congratulations to Andrea, Edgar, and Marty on your graduation. I want to share a joy with you. Two things I like a lot are dressing in women's lingerie, and being in bondage (restricted). I found a woman who truly likes doing that to a man, and we socialized several times, and then last week she dressed me and tied me up. It was a confirmation! The dream I've had for so long, got realized, and it felt perfect. Happy holidays. I'll be back next semester, at least until March 15. Thank you especially to Matt and Daniel for all the effort you put into this group this semester. Mani (age 59)

 Finals Week! Oh, happy day. I just returned from school, the last class I have to attend this semester. Wherein we gave our amusing presentation that had heather smiling and chuckling the whole way through. It turned out great, my part will be well received, and there were no words exchanged between us and our bad group member, Sonya. She stood up there with us, way in the opposite corner of the room, silent as we spoke. That, after coming in 10 minutes late. I turned in another paper under the door of Susies office, successfully capping off that class requirements. I expect a B in that one. And all I have left now is an exam for tomorrow and two 4-5 page essays for which Ive already created theses for. Theyre not due until Friday and another next Monday, but Id like to have them done sooner, preferably to let this weekend be free time. Whos proud of me?!! Amy and Kyle are out to lunch in La Jolla this afternoon only to come back, workout really fast, and then head up to San Clemente for shopping. What am I going to do? Study, paper writes, maybe go eat a burrito. I have some Christmas shopping to do as well, one thing for my brother and one thing for Amy (that I need to get today before she leaves town tomorrow). Best go by the bank and check the balance. Then hit the taco joint. Its not quite over yet.

 i'm thinking about moving my blog to a location not known by the girl.

 What day is it? Yikes, it felt like Friday when I woke up. It took me looking at my email this morning to be sure of the world around me. and good thing, since I have to be cautious of an early rising tomorrow morning after an upcoming night of shooting pool with Kelly and company. I dreamt the old coffee shop was open again and I was working there. I could tell I was dreaming, but I still kept checking with myself as the scene played out. Nothing interesting to add. Just a longing to revert to an old comfort zone, perhaps. A chilly 48 outside here at 10am. Blue toes and frigid fingers making a hot shower and a good sweat at the YMCA sound better than my pointless rambling online. I bought new music accoutrements for the workout regimen that Im excited about employing. And its time for weights after taking three days off to get soft indulging in holiday gluttony. Weights always excite me. the bod looks more proportioned with a strong upper body.

 Porn. Porn is great. So why is it so hard to find in hard copy? Ok, so you can find dozens of male-directed mags at the local liquor store. But what about lesbian porn? I dont mean the usual girl-on-girl action advertised by a mans mag. I mean lesbians BY lesbians. I dont want that cum faced child with some hairy-gorss man. I want women. Loving porn. Loving bondage. Not degrading crap. The other day I bought a copy of Hustler for the first time in my dear life. I though Id get it for the dirty gift exchange at my house for the LGBT gift exchange. You should have seen the lecherous face on the dude ringing me up. da-hahhaha. Shes buying a porno mag. Hil-hil-hil. So when I got it home, I couldnt believe what I was looking at. The porn was ok. Lots of incredibly looking women, all cold and dry. Why cant you show an aroused woman? Is that not beautiful/amazing? It was so totally hetero and full of money shots that dripped from the faces of 19 year old girls with too much makeup. Nasty to me, but men are nasty. It hit their target audience, Im sure. But who wants to see that as the last image of a sex act? Why not lift your leg and piss on her. It seems like the same thing. Put me in there, last frame of me vomiting on his face. (be careful thats another mag) What offended me though? Not that. it was the cartoons spliced in there. With a caption that says, Sex is always better after the big fight. No, not a boxing match on the telly. Ha, ha. Theres the joke. Hes fucking his bride from behind while her bloody face, minus an eye and some loose teeth on the bed covered in blood. Helllooooo?!!! NOT sexy. Just fucked up, really. Oh, there were more images I dont need to relay to you. Whos buying this shit? Ok, besides an unknowing me. I tore those sketches out and still gave it away to an excited girl who wanted to see Jenny Jamesons pussy. Which was adorable, but still. Those ballooning boobs are such a put-off. How long until women get sculpted vaginas? Hm should I change my major from literature and go into plastic surgery?

 Finally. A fellow blogger who writes tales I can appreciate. Have yall ever searched random folks blogs? Some horrible shit out there. A whole lot of stupid. But this woman. Her anonymity adds allure to her escapades, this sex worker mystery. I fantasize about becoming her homosexual counterpart. Check it out, kittens: http://belledejour-uk.blogspot.com A slow listless day before an open window enjoying the sweet smell of freshly cleansed air. Wind and rain bathing the streets, washing away the residue of holiday shoppers crowding the streets. Seems like no one is stirring this day, this shoppers day of revival. How on earth do these secular creatures stand for a whole day of no shops being open? Surely there will come a day when your local Walmart will no longer be equipped with locks on the front doors. Total American consumption, all the time. Medications that kill my sex drive aside, other pieces of me are longing for a little escapade to break up the stasis of my newly single life. Still dreaming of Kerri, waking up sweaty and wanting. The text messages sent/received last night rekindled a little something reminiscent of love but not personalized enough to reach it. Its done and behind us. So now what? Playing at bars with straight girls isnt going to facilitate that need. Something erodes a little more with each blighted attempt to sway a straight woman into my bed. Speaking of erosion how stupid are people? Ok, I know the answer to my query. But come on folks. Fires = an absence of vegetation = certainty of mud slides when it rains. What the hell are people doing out camping in San Bernadino after all our fires when to no surprise of anyone- rain storms are predicted to arrive, dropping at least a couple of inches to the region?!! If they werent dead, Id smack them each with the back of my hand. More dumb being wiped off the Earth. Do we really care to see the press conference on CNN? Notta me, my dearies.

 No check, no play today. And anyway, Im nursing a sore throat that has plagued me for days now. Thoughts of the flu going around has me leery about taxing the bod too much anyhow. I could use an entire day in the house watching the telly and contemplating my navel. What happened to my sex drive? Im on day eight of the new meds, and like a light switch, the lust-drive has vanished from sight. It could keep me out of trouble, sure. Most of what keeps me down (besides the Man, yo) is the memory of the Kerri heartbreak. Keep me from loving, keep me from the downswing. Keep me from the upswing too though. Mental illness or a product of being passionate? You decide. So what are everyones plans for new years? shall I hostess another party? Well, amys not in town. Neither is Luis, and I dont know Robins phone number or how else to get a hold of her without Luis here. And Bryan? Hes not too up for partying. The girls Kelly and Morgen may want to attend. But everyone seems to be unavailable already. Any thoughts, you guys? Email me if you have an idear. Seems a shame to have this big place and no use for it.

 Old school SNL episode with Lionel Richie as the musical guest. What a crack up. Better than the jokes are the fashions. Collared shirts and sweaters with tight jeans and white tennis shoes, skinny little ties with improbable patterns, fluffy dresses to accentuate the feathered hair. Im inspired to show up Kelly at the bar this Saturday with the weirdest outfit. Look! Its Gilbert Godfrey as a kid! Getting the mail today will determine what I do. Meaning, Im awaiting yet another check from the insurance company, a slave to the most humbling of financial sources. I want a job! No, I want money. Il y a une difference. I wonder what the Frys parking lot looks like right now. Ive got a gift certificate wearing a hole in my pocket. MP3 player? New LOUD headphones to tune out with at the gym? Ten copies of a Flock of Seagulls album? Oh, the choices.

 Drinking coffee, watching the storm roll in, praying for the rain to gather momentum and just dump on us. Its a good day to be inside playing with all my fun toys I got for Christmas. Like a digital camera thats a zippo on the outside. And a vacuum! Hooray! Hey, these things excite me. the camera, of course. But the vac! Yay! Ive arrived, baby! Interested in the camera? Check it out: http://www.firebox.com/index.html?dir=firebox&action=product&pid=649 Im so thrilled with it. It takes great pictures too almost as good as my other digital camera! I cant wait to bring it out to parties with me! Tonight Im off to Cindy Lou Whos for Christmas feasting. Hooray, Festivus! But now, it feels proper to eat a bunch of bacon for brekkie with Bryan. Anything open today?

 WOO-HOOO! What a fun little party! Here's some of the pictures...

 i need a nap after this afternoon of work. i had to redo the whole thing to make the stones closer together, making it much harder to fit them together w/only a 1/4" gap max.

 this image speaks for itself...

 Happy, happy, HAPPY!! Feliz navidad n’ shit. I’m done, I’m done, I’m done with school (sung in three-part harmony, please)! I finished my paper in three hours of focused work. It’s all printed out and sitting on my immaculate coffee table in my immaculate condo all ready to be escorted to the sixth floor of Craven Hall, 6242, to Ms Stoddard-Holmes tomorrow morning! hooRAY! To reward myself? Well, a health kick is one way to repay myself for the achievements. Seriously, I feel better than I can remember feeling. Not high-as-a-kite good. But a steady, placid-smile kind of good. I did 45 on the bike, then got up to stretch and walked over to the elliptical for a hard 30 minutes. Yes, this on my off day. I’m proud, especially the added pat on the back of being there before the staff had shown up yet. I spent two hours there, and I was still the only one in the entire gym. I spoiled myself with a Mr. Taco burrito on the way home, eating so fast I finished it within the one mile trek home. No time for hot sauce. Just crammed it down my throat. I earned it. Carrot juice and tea and gallons of my favourite, iced coffee, to keep the energy level up. And to satisfy my behavioural habit of having a drink in my hand. I kept up on the medication schedule, a bit of a task having to take pills four times a day. And the finale?! My HUGE celebration ritual for successfully finishing a semester?! I went out to Barnes and Noble to hunt down some of the texts for next semester so I can get a head start!! Oh lord, do I ever enjoy possessing new books. Crisp, clean lines and the unbroken spines. Books… delivery systems for escape. I lay them out on my bed, long looks for each one as I run my hands over those glossy covers. It’s a seduction, a desire to possess much like the sexual drive for union. I love books. And I need another bookshelf. What did I get? 1. Virginia Woolf – Mrs. Dalloway 2. Virginia Woolf – To the Lighthouse 3. Virginia Woolf – Orlando 4. Virginia Woolf – The Waves 5. Cunningham – The Hours 6. Said – Orientalism 7. Freud – Civilization and Its Discontents 8. Nietzsche – Genealogy of Morals and Ecce Homo 9. Lyotard – The Postmodern Condition (I bought another copy for the hell of it) 10. Foucault – Madness and Civilization And for fun: David Sedaris – Barrel Fever ( I have others of him, and I just die at his humour) Those are maybe a third of my books for the next term. Can you tell I’m taking a author studies course on Woolf? Radical. So much QUEER studies in one term! I can’t wait for the queer studies course. Anyone want a fun class that’s on Friday afternoons? Enroll in QUEER STUDIES!! It’s LTWR 336… 3 units. Promises to be a hoot if nothing else. Man, I feel good. I’m free. I’m healthy. I have encouragement that things will only get better. See you at the Field House gym tomorrow, 7am. It’s weights day.

 Marathon of sleep putting me down from a nap at 3pm yesterday after the gym until this morning at 8:30. Wowee, that’s a long one. Perhaps I needed it after an hour and a half at the gym. I plan another mission to regain my fitness this morning as soon as the gym opens at 10am. Another 30 on the bike, and maybe I’ll bump it up to 45 on the elliptical if I’m feeling saucy. Happy days, you guys. Meds are working. No want for escapism. No desire to be irrationally motivated by impulse. I’m getting things done, but I do them without the short breathing of a manic attack. Like, I take breaks in between detailing the car and rearranging the bricks in the backyard. Only booze can slow me down when I slip into that mode, and drinking is the last thing on my mind. I have one more paper to write. For Martha… a paper that has no real meaning to it, comparing the relationships of the characters in Joyce’s The Dead and Woolf’s The Legacy. But to do it at all, I need to actually read the Joyce story, not just skim it for content. I’ll bring it to the gym with me. Speaking of the gym, I need a new mix CD for the trip (since I lost my mp3 player). Black Eyed Peas or something. So sad that the harddrive crash took with it all 4,000 songs I’d accumulated over the years. I had so much shit. So many esoteric bits of bands that I’ll never even remember the names to, let alone go out and buy their albums.

 Another slow mail day, save from one I was hoping to receive eventually. A response from Crumpet to my email explaining what happened the other night. Best to show your cards when the friendship is worth the effort. Interpersonal relationships are still a bit uncertain for me. Im withdrawn, guarded always mulling over my tendency to shut the door and the shades and shut down. Always retreating into thoughts put in my head by my last PhD about my borderline personality tendencies. The behavior matches up. But do things like that always need a name, a label to circumscribe something much to complex to call a complex? I just got up from a good three hours of reading. Its for school, a preemptive attack on the load that will fall on me when the new semester begins on the 20th. Its for school, yet it seems such a selfish endeavor. Its about me. or rather, parts are. Its in my language, speaks to my experiences. Although Im happy to say I dont have voices in my head like Virginia Woolf (since I stopped using crystal, that is), the description of her creative process mirrors my own. The validation is so satisfying. Inspiring. Yet frightening. Again, the pairing of my inner world with the label of mentally ill is troubling to think about. I think of the mentally ill as tragic, their lives robbed from them. Theres subversion of humanity involved. The madness and the suicide rates and the difficulty in participating in the world these things burrow into my brain, thoughts like a chorus of doubt that unsettles my already unbalanced inner world. Am I this? Am I that? Will the madness cause me the same grim ending to life like the one played out by Woolf? How much /does/ my uncles suicide play into my own propensities, my own wiring? On the other hand, the madness is seductive. Part of me wishes to court it, invite it in, lose myself in the ebb and flow like a bubble in the surf. The intensity is alluring, powerful. Being really alive, distilled. Theres romance to the archetype of the troubled artist. Just as TB used to be romanticized in years passed, the symptoms of madness are exalted in contemporary culture. Ive bought into it. I fancy myself an artist. ive been diagnosed. What exactly does that mean, and how do I fit this information into my life? Time will tell. But without clear observations, the path is fruitless. I need to watch closely, be careful to take care of myself along the way. Its easy to loose control. Much harder to maintain it. No ones reading my crap anymore. My hits were down 50% last month. Few if any comments on the parallel universe sight. Which is ok, leaving me without a preconception of the audience Im writing to. Autonomy is freeing. I think Ill go back to the reading. I want to finish it by tomorrow morning.

 16 hours of sleep, and I think Id rather get back into bed to read and watch tv than do any real writing. (yawn) yeah, I could go back to bed. Ive got nothin.

 My pals are ranking high on the loser list. Days since Ive received emails from friends. Not just the out-of-towners, but the trend seems to have extended beyond into the most trivial of connections. Is it the holidays? Yet still I write up a storm. Not because its required of me. Far from it. I do this because I must. I can live without writing. Seriously for those of you not aware, I do this not for your sake but for mine alone. I have to. Ive been doing this for ten years now, and I have volumes to prove it even to account for the pre-blog time period. Black books on my bookshelf. If I dont write, I freak out. Ive sunk to writing on bar napkins in Italy to fulfill the need, even if only to throw them out the next morning. Speaking of Italy. My dear Anna. My Italian/British Anna. It may be against all rationale, but Ive assigned this mysterious hooker (http://belledejour-uk.blogspot.com/) the face of my lusted-after Anna. The London dialect spawned it. I dont know enough British folk to exchange the image for another more suited to take the place of it. And as far as Anna is concerned, I have a silly crush on her more powerful than I have for this woman writing tales of her icky jobs. In fact, Im still head-over-heals smitten with the real Anna. Two moments between us keep me from shaking that desire as I normally would. One: New Years Eve, 2002. On the rooftop apartment of a stranger, invited there by Anna. The unknown couple, Anna and her boyfriend Eddy Anna invited me. fortunate for me too because the family I was staying with decided to leave me to myself that night, and I had already begun to cry at the thought of spending the holiday alone in my flat watching television in a language that mocked my difference. And drinking alone once again to quell the despair of being so inconsolably alone. Me and Anna. That night, she bummed a smoke from me, and we spent the time on the rooftop deck a good ways away from the sliding doors to the said friends apartment. We spoke of intensely personal moments (or at least I did, hammered as I was), watching the sparks of fireworks explode near a hillside beside us. I remember unconsciously leaning into her, but wanting more than anything to just sit with her, in her arms in silence. To be with her in any way I could with honour. I grew silent, smelling her hair and her skin. I wanted to sink, to drown in the sensory bliss of that fraction of a moment. It only lasted a second, but one that seemed protracted in my memory. I think I whispered a thank you for bringing me out. But it didnt come out with the underpinnings of desire that Id actually felt. It couldnt come out that way. The scenario didnt permit it. What I wanted was to kiss her madly. I remember that desire like it was yesterday. I wanted to show her something. I wanted to merge with the woman Id so grown to love. Even a simple kiss seemed a readily, appropriate embodiment. Even though by that time I was drinking straight whiskey, and I could hardly walk from the car to the lift to my flat. On my long walk home (twenty steps) Taking off my boots, I flung myself off the toilet and into the tile wall in front of me, head first, nearly knocking me out cold but succeeding in securing a big hard lump on my head for a horribly hung over New Years Day. I tell THAT story anyone wants to compete with me when it comes to most embarrassing moment. For something that happened while all alone, a whole lot of folks seem to have heard about it. Self-Deprecation Playhouse, starring ME! Two: The day I said goodbye to her. Shit, I still cant stand to think about this without a drink in hand. She met me outside of the corner Despar, the midway point between my flat and hers. I got there early because I so loved to see her tall, blond figure in a long coat grace the city streets to cross an intersection. Id fallen in love with her, you guys. For one, I was so alone. And two. Well I know what I love about women. And she blew the doors off of most of that by the first night I met her. Sheesh, I hugged her like a long, lost relative by that nights end when I first met her! And by the second time I saw her, I was dumb struck with the feelings that surfaced. Shes an amazing woman, yall. I dont throw my affections around without warrant. So the last time I saw her. There she was, in her wool coat and soft blue eyes. Its her mouth that made me fall for her, but the entire rest of her each fraction of her body, her being all caused a stir in me at various moments. The time she took off her woolies to expose the tank top she had on underneath. I was on the phone with my mom at the time, but I spaced out on the conversation completely when I saw those firm, beautiful arms as she stood there in the kitchen. If shed turned around, I would have been caught gawking. Instead, I stored it away as a private image to come back to when light was low and my heart was aching of complacent consignment. That was real. Like little else ever is. So that day Im getting to it. All the way to the corner where our paths diverted, I mourned each street crossing we came to. At one point I began to cry, embracing her for no apparent reason. I knew what was ahead, and I couldnt do it. What I longed for is that never-given invitation to come up to her apartment to say goodbye that would satisfy even me. To be with her, even if it materialized only as a few minutes holding her in the privacy of four walls. And then we reached that intersection. I couldnt believe this was it. And come on, I knew that was the last time Id see her. Thats the closest Id ever be with her. We held each other for a few moments. Im not sure how it actually happened. All I know is I looked up into her eyes, and all I wanted was to kiss her. This one powerful, passionate kiss that would communicate all I felt for her. Not just my lust. That wouldnt be satiated by a kiss. I wanted to seal something in a passionate moment, something in as dramatic a fashion as the experience Id had with her. I wanted to love her. Just for a few seconds, I wanted to be with her in a way thats recognized as legitimate. I wanted to give her something. And I wanted her to give it back to me. to this day, I wish Id just planted one on her. Or just held onto her hand for a moment more. I thought I sensed something similar to what I was feeling, but I couldnt risk it. To blight the moment would have crushed me, so I backed down. And I went home and cried my eyes out. I hurt so much. Because I didnt say what I felt, not because I thought my feelings were illegitimate. I continued to send her fun things in the mail, but it never reached the target I was after. Materials even the emotions embodied by films. That wasnt it. But at least I gave the next best thing once I was gone. I love you, Anna. You loved me during a time of the most complete darkness. I havent forgotten that. I still feel Ive yet to translate my experience of you. Since I never had the honour of bringing your lips to mine, take my writing as a surrogate, however incomplete. As gifted as I may be in writing, the only thing that seems to speak true is my body. Call it inappropriate, but call it genuine. I wanted to, but it wasnt in the cards for me to put to action. Youd have been cross with me. Or instead, it would have recast us both in a light that wouldnt have honoured us properly. It sucks. I still yearn to be that with her. I wonder what it would have meant to me during these years of pain and emotional drought to have had a more fruitful encounter with such an amazing creature. Unlike other women, she occupies a singularly unique place in my heart. Not just because she was my only loving contact in such a cruelly vacant experience. But because she so freely showed her humanity to me. My God, I miss her. And yes, I still long to see her again.

 I've left new links to the site. I know you've all ignored the sidebar for a while (unchanged as it has been). But there are now pictures to lure your eyes that way. A link to Belle de Jour and a link to my other blog in a parallel universe (i thought i'd make them different, but it isn't so - just a different format where you can post comments right there onto individual blogs). Enjoy.

 La Belle says tonight: "Tomorrow I should go out and spend all my money on underwear, then throw them about the room to decide my fate like a satiny, lace-gussetted I-Ching. Let the gods of Beau Bra decide." I adore this woman. She's a call girl in London, but she's witty and bright and can string sentences together. I desire to be her lesbian, so-cal counterpart. I desire /more/ to continue my voyeuristic stalking through her blog. And invent my own fantasies to insert between the lines of her text. I'm enamoured with her. Is that so wrong to idolise a hooker? All relationships have a flavour of prostitution to me anyway. Theres always this unspoken element of mutual exchange that goes beyond money. It always seems to land in levels of compromise that tinge the whole affair in commercialism. By that, I mean /commerce/, not monitarily. I exchange my desire to talk freely about east asian politics for your silence on matters of your workmates relationship troubles. I exchange being denied my want of getting fisted for your want of battery-powered fun time. It varies with the relation. And really, Im being sensational in my examples at the expense of making my point; prostitution never seemed that far off from me and what Ive been through. You want to delve deeper? Get yourself a PhD and a couch. She says tonight too: All romance is narcissism, someone told me once. This was the same person who also told me women over 30 should never wear their hair long, so it's probably an unreliable source, but still. Is it narcissism? Someone told /me/ once that when youre in love with someone, youre really only in love with yourself when youre with that person. A variant of the same theme. Truthful? Maybe. But when youre in it, no one can break it down to its parts and tell you such a thing in a way that youll believe it. Love is a drug. Roxy Music had it right. Mind-altering. Mood-changing. Its dangerous in my experience. The come-down is a bitch. Wait. Wasnt my New Years Resolution Musing Session touching on this? Wondering whether it would do me good to kerb my cynicism? Isnt it that cynacism that Im now buying into by restating the words of this mysterious woman? We only hear what confirms our reality. When words to us dont fit readily, we discard it as false, as misguided. You can say that of me, my view here tonight. or you can say that of yourself. Who really knows? Yet Ill add reinforcements to my POV: romantic love was only invented in the last millennium. Or recognized at something more than animal/hormonal lust. To call it more would threaten the authority of the church, I see. But still this stupid Hollywood fantasy of falling in love with a dreamy guy and breeding happily away is as foreign to me as having an arranged marriage to a Siberian Husky. To further colour your view of "love," here's a commodity from Japan. Just lovely, isn't it? How do you say "misogynist" in Japanese?

 But this one... This one goes on my desktop. This is simply beautiful. Beyond words.

 Oh, what a GOLDMINE I just discovered. LTWR girls, eat your hearts out: Oh, the abundance I feast on. Thanks, internet technology!

 the first sunset of the new year:

 I thought I only wanted to read tonight. But as I sat down on the leather recliner with my book, I yearned for something to add to the experience. I need to speak of what Im connecting with. This book this book is coming through me with as much knowing as I can imagine. Theres this true and powerful identification occurring inside, connecting with the authors characterization of ms. Woolf. I feel my own inner world being described. A sense of unity with this woman, this writer immersed in the out-of-body experience of creation. I know I am a writer. It is my calling, my passion, the space where I feel most satisfied. Like my talents as a soccer player, I slip into this zone of being. I dont just play the game, I am the game. I lose myself, create plays, defy my own expectations of my skill. I become the game, wholly and without doubt. I feel this way when I write. I write because I have to. As much as I require to eat and breath and lust for sex, I must write to complete my world. I am at peace before the computer, thinking without effort as my fingers move without conscious intention about the keyboard. Its more than an extension of me. It is me. The pragmatist interrupts here for a moment. There will come a time when I will need to parlay this into making a living for myself. I have no designs to marry well, to afford myself the luxury of being supported financially by another. I have rich parents. This is essential at this stage of my life. But this cannot last. I need to pull free of the bonds of financial dependence. I need this to further my capacity to write, not just for my emotional development. This kind of writing this confessional brand of writing this is my comfort zone. Not fiction, not analytical essays. Although I can manage alright within the spheres of both. No where does this flavour of writing enter into the capitalist scheme? How can I transcribe my words into marketable fodder? To be financially dubious means a risk to my life alone. I need this space apart from human interruption. I wont always have this place of my own, safely isolated from disturbance and all the risks associated with interpersonal interaction. Not unless I buy this place from my folks. And thats going to take some pragmatic doing. I want for my aunt to read this book. Paula go buy Cunninghams novel, The Hours. It won the Pulitzer for a reason. Its remarkably written, so acutely insightful into the minds of three women living at different times but with paralleling complications due to their respective social limitations. They embody shades of the same woman, transcendent of historical timelines. Its brilliant, and Im only 40 pages into it. Where are we going, Walt Whitman? The Clash is singing Lost in a Supermarket on the stereo downstairs, and Im reminded of the pensive poem of Alan Ginsberg. Im always thinking of that poem. For years, it comes into my head on a weekly basis. Something will trigger it. Like this book, it speaks for me. I roll it around in my mouth, attentive to the flavour it releases. This space I find myself in this evening. Before the medication, I would be manic with it. The sheer energy of transcendent connection would envelop me, swallow me whole, drown me in emotion too powerful for my single self to contain. But instead instead I can be with it, experience it and honour it. Its not going to destroy me. this night like so many before it and so many more to come this is being alive. The extremes are not frightening, that threat promised when an undertow would present itself. An undertow to take me deep into depression or the flip side when I would feel unable to stop the mania overtaking me. where exalted transcendence would separate me from myself. Either way, the break from reality the uncontrolled push and pull by invisible forces. Eleven pills a day. Somehow the chemical assistancethank god Ive found some balance. And further, that I can still find the zone without the terrifying abandon to strange energies. Mm plays dark, complicated beats downstairs. The music is inside of me tonight. With each selection picked at random by my player, I shift shapes into nostalgic reverie or dampened weight. The aperture of the soul is cranked wide open tonight, inviting all that presents itself an unadulterated opportunity to affect me. But its safe. There is no one here to threaten the indulgence of feeling. There is no doom on the horizon to cause me worry that the darkness will disguise my better judgment. No super-caliber light to blind my ocular connection to the ground beneath me. Talking about mental illness is difficult if youre not in my body, I imagine. Do I do it justice to try to describe it? Ive only recently begun to acknowledge that an illness haunts me. Ive always been a bit off. Thought it idiosyncratic or eccentric but never a bonefide chemical imbalance. Then again, with all the narcotics Ive used in my time they warn you of the potential to bring a susceptibility to the surface when you abuse hard drugs. Did I bring this on myself? Or did I use them to deal with the disease before I recognized what it is? Crystal gave me consistency of feeling. I knew exactly the trajectory of the high as measured by my intake. I knew exactly how hard Id fall when all the elation evaporated. Marijuana was a godsend the way it balanced me into a state of continual paranoia and paralysis. I invented my own bubble of anxiety to live in. Now its just alcohol. My mistress. Kept in the cupboard for days, and then she emerges full of light and life. A promise of abandon from my better judgment. An allowance of moral freedom. A vacation from my path, is what it is. Kept in check, its harmless. So long I continue to realize the larger compromises accepted by indulging in it. Neko is on the stereo now downstairs. I think its time to disengage the writer and engage the base animal lust for impassioned song.

 Inspiring. I just finished watching The Hours and Im struck dumb. Not in a totally transformative way. But a spark of foresight into how this excursion into the mind of Virginia Woolf is going to affect me. I feel a kinship. I find relief in her madness, her sense of herself, the longings kept out of reach. Three lesbian kisses. God bless the film industry. Im satiated for now. I spent the entire duration of the film working out. Feeling that affirmation being connected to my body, of experiencing my self while my mind is carried by the imagination of another. I feel less like writing and more like listening. I see my reflection in the open window, looking out into the twinkling distance, to the atmospheric disturbance in the night sky. My face holds a pensive expression. Clear forehead free of the burdens of the world. I am self-contained, cool, sangfroid. Ive seen my reflection in this film, in this writer. Her madness, her genius. I take it back; I do feel transcendent tonight. Stepping outside of my world yet stepping right into the meat of it. Centered and yet held above it all. A passive-exulted centeredness. I will sink back into the comfort of others voices. Tonight I will read, listen to the words. Revel in the singular immediacy of the writers vision.

 Ah, another new year. And how many thoughts I have running through my little head today. Im torn between indulging in them now and getting my workout done. I spent the day with the boy seeing LOTR for the second time, then coming home to clean up the mess left by two quiet party-goers last night. What will this year bring? Another birthday, sending me closer to my long sought after age of 30. a graduation from the university. A trip to Africa. A new job, I hope. Lots in store for me this year. A revised attitude is always inspired by the start of a new year. What shall I change about my preconceptions? Lose some of my cynicism about love and relationships? Should I endeavor to leave my house more, putting myself out there? Its definitely time to lose that ten pounds gained over the course of the semester. My body image isnt what it used to be, and Im more than willing to do the work to improve it. Watching my much adored idol, Ian McKellan up there on the screen today launched me into a reverie of gay representation in my world. Trevor and his little friend were shocked to learn that the man is gay. Hopefully the mlange of admiration and curiosity will plant a seed in their brains, change their uncertain minds about what it is to be queer. Trevor is well on his way to being accepting. But its a constant effort to battle the contradictory viewpoints expressed by his peers. So I went to the video store, shopping for images to fulfill my lust to see my queer self reflected in the media. I desire it. I get into these fits where I simply must see a homosexual succeed. Since I have no friends to represent that, to stand in that role, I turn to what I can get. Since Gods and Monsters was rented out, I opted for a purchase of Far From Heaven (only 6.99!) and a rental of The Hours, in part to give me a head start on the novel I need to read for the Virginia Woolf course coming up. Sidebar: Can you believe that Trevors mom, Candice, has never heard of Virginia Woolf? All those millions of dollars she has, and yet things like that escape her. What world does she live in, I wonder. A world of Oprahs book club, no doubt. But I digress. I feel empowered this afternoon. Beginning with a responsible and relatively sober New Years Eve celebration with someone I truly care about, the day has shifted into a confidence exercise. I will watch another film (the USC game is a blow-out) while getting my hour+ workout. I will watch gay characters struggle while I too fight to better myself in preparation for an uncertain future.

 Il y a un problme. La nuit que jai parle a les femmes, jai propose que nous prenons Ecstasy pour New Years Eve. So now the thought of it is in my head. I just called Kegler to inquire about the possibility of acquiring a few pills for the evening. Hes making calls, although no one I know is still doing real drugs and I doubt the impulse will present itself in physical form. Lucky that Im that far away from my old drug life. I used to have three folks I could call for anything from weed to meth to E to coke. Anything. Its been three years since Ive taken E. After taking them every weekend for about six months, thats some incredible stretch of time. A hundred pills maybe Ive taken in my time. Equal to acid hits (except for that time I spilled liquid L on my hands, I would be under a bit). Yet its been over five years since Ive snorted a line of meth or smoked it. And that stuff nearly killed me. Is this wise to try getting high again? No. yet at least Im not bringing it to the Lit Girls. The fact that I even mentioned it hurts me. Theyre innocents. I would feel horrible for years knowing I brought them to such a dangerous drug. Its dangerous because its good. So good, Im in love with everything and everyone. I could stare at a corpse and love it. And its so terribly bad for you. I cant be responsible for that. Its fabulous, that drug. But once. Once I had the worst trip of my life on any substance. I could feel the base of my spinal column burning. The hole that burns into your brain on that stuff. Tony was giving me a back massage, and suddenly I went into terror mode. I jumped up and screamed and ran off. I thought he was going to rape me. I spent the entire trip trying not to die, staring at the ribbon hanging off of a balloon stuck to the ceiling. If I moved my eyes, I thought I would die. I took too much. And all at once. And the only thing I could do was to focus on breathing and wait it out. The things I saw that night it was so terrifying, I cant put it to words. Too much heroin in them, I guess. And mescaline. And theres no way I want them to see me jonesing. I cant take just one or two. I want four by the time the night is over. I start grinding my jaw and getting cranky, pulling out my hair and chain smoking. I get wacko. I crave. I crave in an ugly way. Ill do anything for more. Even smoking dope. Most people just eat a lot, laugh, and get stupid. Me? I get manic. I talk too much. I get incredulous about the media and the philosophy of stoners. I cant enjoy myself the way normal people do. I like to clean, food disgusts me, and I get weird. Any drug. I dont react normally. I retain my ability to speak in clear, concise sentences. I retain all my mental faculties. I lose my sex drive on most things (pot and E, aside), and I worry a lot about other peoples trips. Im a good guide for trippers, but sometimes I need one of my own. Why go through all of that. Thats why I say this New Years just DRINK. You get the same effect each time, and youll never end up in tears in the corner of the room with liquor. Ok, thats not true. Dont ask me about anything. Can I put Lord Gandolf on my sexually amazing list? I just love him. And I can put him there because were both queer.

 Damn! No more Ephedra! I used to pop those ("cross tops") when I was a teenager and couldn't get a hold of any crystal. Take two, and you're on your way. Take a handful and you're rollin'. Thats MS Reardon to you, Sausage Smuggler. Today I went to get my eyes checked again. Seems that since I turned 25, my eyes have taken a turn for the worse. It bothers me to read. I can feel my bad eye giving up and making me cross-eyed. Not attractive, no. So I went, getting there early to scope the frame options. The ones I /really/ liked were $500. Doh. Mom would wring my neck if I charged that to her credit card (along with the 200 for the exam, etc.). so I got some cheaper ones that look alright. No more Lisa Loeb impersonations, but I think that joke has run its course. Filling out the preliminary paperwork, I came across a seemingly innocuous question: Are you currently taking any medications? The image of Ms. Collette Reardon popped into my head. Seen that sketch on SNL? Good god, I had to list a whole SIX medications. Like, See attached page. Ive barely just remembered the names of all of them. Lamictal, Elavil, Neurontin, Buspar, Effexor, and Darvocet. You try remembering all that! On top of remembering to take Neurontin FOUR times a day. Its a chore. Then again, so is keeping up on your health. Eating right, exercising, keeping the house sterile, sleeping properly.

 Crazy folks in the neighborhood. I took this photo outside of the local Longs Drugs Store next to campus. Some crotchety-looking old man sitting in the front seat of the truck. A /real/ good example of heterosexuality. Boy, oh boy! Sign me up for a chance to marry THAT! NPR news advice of the day: Skip the cattle brains this holiday. No spinal cord flourishes on the table this year either. And one more thing: If I hear one more news reporter mentioning how LUCKY we are to have sunshine instead of rain, Im going to knock their empty heads together. Not that their bias against inconvenient weather has any bearing on the way the world plays out. But come on ya fools! What do you think caused the wildfires!! (besides the mismanagement of the forests by the California Department of Forestry) Bought some champagne for the event tomorrow night. Its looking like a quiet affair at my place for whoever wants to come over. Some music, maybe a movie, and plenty of snacky foods. RSVP by tomorrow afternoon, and Ill give out directions. Me and Bryan both have to be up early on New Years Day, so were pulling for some quiet interaction.

 Yay! Futurama is back on the air! Adult Swim on Cartoon Network. Not too sure of the time, but Im happy to see that its back in some form outside of the purchase of DVDs. Makes me think of the copy of the final episode of The Family Guy that was yanked from being aired because of its chancy content. I didnt really like the show (that baby irked me), but the last episode should be required viewing. Anyone want to borrow it? Its on DVD compliments of my brother. Nostalgic humour. I suppose its time (oh, I have the time) to transcribe the LAST REMAINING COPY of something I wrote up back in the 9th grade. I thought it forever lost through time and various hard drive crashes. But when I moved, I found myself a copy neatly folded up in a box all by itself. It used to make me pee my pants, and even still I laugh. It made me plenty of friends to pass around. Anyone ready?

 A flash of ennui lead to one of the most comprehensive cleaning fits in recent memory. By god, I own a new fabulous- vacuum that Id yet to spend time with. After taking the thing apart to find its potential flaws, I declared it sound and went to work. Used the mini-vac on the stairs, swiffered the floors, cleaned the car interior (its raining, why wash it?), dishes, cupboard reorganizing, closet reorganizing, laundry, bleaching the blood out of the sheets, cleaned the cat box let me know when youve heard enough. I even took the last of a Darvocet bottle just to tidy up, throw away the empty. And why not? I did an hour on the bike and 50 push-ups, 100 sit-ups, light arm weights. Now that I have all of that equipment in my house, i dont have to even walk outside to get sweaty. My arms are getting nice and fit finally. I want to look tougher. Compensate for shaky insides. I feel good now. In control. Safely locked in the house alone. Even the overdue cable bill isnt worrying me. I should be used to ringing up debts I cant pay by now. Only a matter of time before I can get a job again and catch up. While working out, I indulged in some horrible television (a redundancy, I realize). I was watching a VH1 special on cradle robbers and another on hot single Hollywood types. The images propelled me to produce another list. Here goes: The TOP TEN most Fuckable Famous Women: (ah-hem) 1. Catherine Zeta-Jones (ugh, and her accent kills me) 2. Selma Hayak (no words necessary) 3. Kristin Davis (aka Charlotte York from Sex and the City) 4. Angelina Jolie (her blood fetish is right-o with me) 5. Lisa-Marie Presley (its those eyes and her cute little mouth, not her personality) 6. Gina Gershon (in Bound) 7. Madonna (at any time in her career) 8. Neko Case (goddess of song) 9. Demi Moore (still ruins me I know shes a Claudia-era crush) 10. and finally, Barbara of the Bush Twins (young, but adorable) See? I really do need school to occupy my mind with more constructive endeavors. This is what you get when Ive got too much time on my hands and no love in my /real/ life to direct my energies. Im watching The Blues Brothers for the second time in as many days. Its been running on Comedy Central this week. So why dont we throw in my first famous crush, Princess Leia. Man, was Carrie Fisher hot. And queer! Ah, its fun to fantasize. I suppose I could add a boy to the list. That blond elf kid from the Lord of the Rings trilogy. He looks like a woman. Only his anatomy is all wrong for me. but isnt he cute? Back to the cleaning. I think Ill bleach the grout on the kitchen counters.

 Heavily draped in sweatshirts and pants, fleece beenie and fingerless gloves trying to ward off the chill in the ol condo. I spent all of yesterday moping in bed with the heated blanket all fired up watching TV and drinking tea. Phones turned off and the shades pulled tight. Feeling like an asshole, deeply depressed, and afraid to get up for any reason. I slept enough, Id say. Fourteen hours after the day in bed. Enough to destroy whatever was making my throat hurt. Enough to make me forget how upset I got myself for the night before. So what? I kissed someone. Its not the first time Ive kissed a straight girl. I think it was the allowance of wanting more that irked me. It wasnt for shock value. Well, the first one was. But then I grabbed her again, and I made her pull away. D-nied! Yep, that did it. That scene seemed to rub it in that Im back to being the only lesbian I know. Im in for a wild ride of misdirected affection (men gag- and otherwise) until I get up the courage to try dating someone again. And in the world I live in, thats not going to happen too soon. Where are the women? So Im laying low for a while. Im a little weirded out on myself. A little uncertain of how to make this transition from happily dating to being just another reclusive queer. I can work out at home alone. I can write all I want here at the computer. I can sleep all I want. Nothing but short trips to the store for coffee and cigarettes and the occasional beer. If I dont have to be anywhere, why go?

 Thats it; Im getting a new cat tomorrow. A nice cat. A cat that doesnt scar me on his way to freedom after trying to pet the stupid thing. Its just a rat with a cuter outfit. Why I spend this much time and money into nurturing something thats hard wired to hate being indoors and domestic is suddenly coming clear I do it out of obligation. I adopted a mysterious child from the pound. And this sucker is too much for me. Ive had Vato for four months, and still he tries to maim me when I try to pet him. So I let him out again tonight. But this time, instead of coaxing him back inside after 30 seconds this time, I shut the door and turned on the patio light. If he wants to come back for the food, hes welcome. Otherwise, I have no cat. Think Im heartless? Im not. I still want him as my kitty. But hes mean. Hes mean, and I want a nice cat. A mushy, fun, loving cat. I try to hold him, I try to just play with him and I end up bleeding. Every fucking time!! Ill go to the pound tomorrow and inquire. I wont let them kill Vato. He was on cue to die at the end of September. Too sad. Let him fight for himself. Ill let him be my outdoor/indoor cat. Ill keep feeding him and whatnot. But hes no longer the master of my domain. He has his claws. Long ones at that; I never cut his. God, I have this new slash across my pale chest from his last blow-up. His eyes all blackened and roaming like a spooked horse. I was glad to let him out tonight. Go ahead. Tell me Im heartless. Hes been raised to be a snot. Theres a reason why his last owners gave him up to a shelter.

 Again with Ivy. I brought her up at dinner tonight with my extended family, so the topic is still as fresh at this hour as it was this late afternoon when I ran by the hospital. I thought some more about her on the way home. Yes, on the way home after drinking a 22oz. Korean beer and hitting the same freeway she crashed on, the I15. Ivy. Part of me has this hang up. I dont know her very well. But does that matter? Shes my classmate. I have this pestering thought, this imaginary eye that sees my compassion as an unnatural response. Sees my attention to this as suspect, smelling of something more having to do with me and my situation than her, a relative stranger. Maybe. You know, maybe it is. Only six months ago I put myself in the hospital. Took myself there, granted, to get my 24 stitches in secret to mend a bloody mouth gaping from my forearm. Really, Ive felt the life of my own little self in jeopardy lately. Not since these new meds, but still. This year. Its still current in my memory, my reality. Death and tragedy is only a step away from all of us, no matter how we lead our lives. So there. Thats my rationale. My world is suddenly stable, but I understand what its like to be in danger of losing everything. Only I asked for it, in a way. She did not. I need your help here, all of you blogger regulars. Tell me Can I/Should I do something to generate revenue to contribute into her soon-to-be-created charity fund at the local Washington Mutual? Or will you tell me to relax? That I dont need to come to a strangers rescue when some simple cards and emails will suffice from me. But but most people suck when it comes to showing up when the feelings are difficult and theres a lot on the line. i mean, the ones who arent intimately involved. Other students? Do you think that many of her classmates are playing an active part? To me, this is about helping her parents too. I met her dad. And since I met him, I cant help but want to help. I have the energy to do more than just delivering one card. Will someone please give me permission to remain active in this? Tthe world is a stage for despair, acted out again and again at every moment of every day. I feel more kinship with Ivy than I do 90% of the rest of the assholes that roam this planet. Crises define us. Maybe I need more definition. But really, Id like to think this has less to do with me. Im always giving too much. But Ive never had any complaints. Id like to think that the effort is being received.

 Only in southern california would someone get in the car to drive 100 yards to the other side of a strip mall. That was me this afternoon, and Id just gotten finished with a workout. God forbid I expend any energy in the real world. Im hoping to drop some pounds, and this is how I operate? At least I was aware of it, laughed at myself, and thought it through to rationalize it away. I was saving my back from carrying heavy bags of groceries too far from the market to my car. You buy it, dont you? Speaking of the back, its not fixed yet by any means. Im still taking pain pills to work out. And it makes this snapping sound when I bend down. Id wager Ive got two years before Im back in the hospital for another surgery. Hospital I bought another card to drop off at Palomar Medical Center for Ivy. I keep thinking about her, how out of nowhere she crashed her car on the 15 on the way to school (and our class!!) and is now fighting for her life. Just as I write that, in comes an email from Heather Hayton informing the class of her uncertain status. Strange how the thoughts of Ivy burning in my mind would result in an update right at that moment. Nothing seems worth my words when things like that are in my mind. My blather just seem trite when juxtaposed with such a grave situation.

 Heres the horrible scene that woke me up this morning jackhammers and concrete cutters to get the street to resemble a block of rubble in Bam. So loud, I fell back asleep with pillows strapped to my melon. the day was slow, spending two hours at the gym and coming straight home to lay low and be domestic. The adrenaline of an hour on the elliptical faded into a placid quiet in my body, undermining my resolve to go out and socialize. So here I am, watching the box and yawning, considering ending the night at 6:30pm. Or maybe just open a beer and enjoy the low hum left by a day well spent. 109 million miles away there is a small camera shooting footage of the surface of another planet. Im dumbstruck at the achievement. With all the stupidity in the world, be grateful there are those who stand on the other side of the bell curve. Our betters redeem our species.

 ok, you all. get used to my new blog instead of this one, because soon i'll move on over. i'll keep this one up for archives, but i really want to change the format, allow for visitor's comments, etc. the new address is urlLink here .

 Fighting the cat! The little bugger wont let me pet him, so Im forcing the issue on him. Ha! You will submit to my will! Spent the afternoon with my feet up, shoes off, at the neighbourhood Starbucks reading Mrs. Dalloway. Im half way through it, yet I plan to have it finished by tonight. After finishing The Hours last night at 11pm ( I couldnt sleep until I had it done), I can say with conviction that Im a true reading kick. Why cant I be this diligent during the semester? Worked hard at the gym, adding another 50 push-ups (my limit so I dont hulk up) and an hour on the bike watching football. I rewarded myself with a quick trip to the Pannikin for a bagel and a hammerhead, then to Sports Authority for new weight lifting gloves. I deserve it. My old ones have holes in the palms. Ive had them for years, and the stench of gym coodies wasnt coming off in the wash anymore. It time to take pills again. Third time of the day, one more to go before bed. I have to say I found the perfect balance today. A full load of endorphins, a darvocet, and the morning six usuals. I felt great driving home. No alcohol for a couple of days helps too. I met my neighbours today. I had to get them to sign off on my backyard plans. Silly regulations. But anyway, I met the two wives on either side of me. both Hispanic, one of them gigantic with child. It was nice to introduce myself, to be known other than the lesbian next door. My other neighbour who lives in the front side of our building came out to chat with me. seems a problem with my garage is making loud reverberations in her condo. I showed her my yard, she showed me her place. Shes nice, really. Only I cant remember her name! Looks like Bryan is jumping on the blog bandwagon. Another to add to my friends list! Whoo-hoo!

 I saw a programme on PBS the other night on the historical roots of our belief in vampires. A woman. A woman is who first sparked the notion of blood-suckers. Countess Elizabeth Bathory kidnapped more than 600 young women and had them brought back to her castle in Transylvania. She believed that if she bathed in the blood of young virgins, she would attain immortal life and retain her failing youth. Found in her dungeon were over 600 young women, dead and drained of blood. (If she were a lesbian, she wouldnt have had to kill a single one. A-thank you) It seems the intermarrying practice of folks within her family produced a significant number of mental conditions. Psychosis and evil geniuses, most notably the sadistic Elizabeth. Her husband was of an equally sadistic ilk. Heres what I found: While fashionably fighting the Turks and attempting to gain information from prisoners captured, her husband employed a horrid device of torture: clever articulated claw-like pincers, fashioned of hardened silver; which, when fastened to a stout whip would tear and rip the flesh to such an obscene degree that even he, a cruel man, abandoned the apparatus in disgust and left it at the castle as he departed on yet another heroic foray. And some more information telling of her state of mind: Elizabeth was not alone in her 'unusual' interests. Aware of Elizabeth's complex preoccupations, and amused by them, her aunt had introduced her also to the pleasures of flagellation (enacted upon desolate others of course), a taste Elizabeth quickly acquired. Equipped with her husband's heinous silver claws, she generously indulged herself, whiling away many lonely hours at the expense of forlorn Slav debtors from her own dungeons. The more shrill their screams and the more copious the blood, the more exquisite and orgasmic her amusement. She preferred to whip her 'subjects' on the front of their nude bodies rather than their backs, not only for the increased damage potential, but so that she could gleefully watch their faces contort in horror at their most grim and burning fate. She soon began to be consumed with her complex about her aging appearance. While lashing out at a female servant, she drew blood from the young womans cheek. At the place on Elizabeths body that the blood splattered, she swore that her skin looked more youthful. And thus the obsession began. She drank the blood of the beautiful, and she washed herself in the blood of the others. Each girl was bound and hung by their ankles, their throats slit and the blood drained for Elizabeths bath. She preferred the blood to retain the warmth of their young bodies, still sticky and crimson from a fresh slaughter. Every once in a while, an especially beautiful young girl would be found. Elizabeth would sometimes drink her blood from a ceremonial gold goblet. Yet she moved on to the more ghastly; she drank from the stream directly as the body hung upside down screaming and turning pale. She was eventually found out after moving on to more elite women (and after throwing drained bodies over the castle walls one night). But because of her aristocratic status, she was not condemned to arrest. Instead she was imprisoned in her castle, enclosed by impenetrable walls, where she died four years later. Disgusting and fascinating. And somehow perversely erotic. Blood is beautiful; however I tend to faint if I see it outside the context of someones menstruation. Its the sadism that interests me. Embraced too far, of course. But still incredible.

 Ok, so maybe I am a little sad the stupid cat is dead. The house I dead without a living thing to accompany me. so much space, so little living matter. Granted, he was a feral beast. But I still got used to having him here. Even grew to understand the scars he gave me when I tried to pet him. But hes gone. So I did what I always do when I lose someone. I went through the house and removed everything thats associated with the thing. I took his catbox and cleared it out, setting the plastic receptacle in the garage. Along with his scratching post. Then went through the house and collected his toys, putting them in a bag to give to my aunt who has a kitty (a super nice one at that). yet it didnt settle me. It wasnt enough to convince me hes gone. I opened the pantry and saw the stacks of cat food. I cant very well throw that out too. so I took a can outside in case the brat comes back to find a shut door. It wont happen, but still its a gesture. Maybe more for my ease than the cats. Like when Kerri dumped me. not out of spite but to save myself from painful reminders, I went through the place to gather her things. I wanted to give them back, drop them at her house when I knew she wouldnt be there, to let her have her things without the awkwardness of having to ask for them. Or for us to see each other. If I saw her even now, it would ruin me. Her stuff It wasnt much. But then when she didnt return the favour, I was bummed. She has my favourite book ever. And my favourite DVD. A book of Raymond Carver stories and _Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf?_. who can live without that stuff? It wouldnt take much to replace them , but the problem is she doesnt READ! Nor does she appreciate real films. The former bothers me more. Its /my/ copy. I assign meaning to that. Poor Vato. The violent end Im sure he met. Its more or less my fault. I didnt like him. But I liked him enough to let him outside where he was happier. Until the other day, he would actually let me pet him when he was out there in the yard soaking up the sun. the risk didnt bother me, having him outside. Just that he would let me love him when he was out there. Yet, theres more predators than dirt in my neighborhood. Hes so dead. Why does my right nipple hurt? Was this part of another party-related escapade that I dont remember? I dont remember taking my top off and being bitten. Not this time anyway. Then again I forgot a few things that happened that night. Im glad the leather cuffs werent employed at least. Back to their hooks on the wall to gather dust until I find me another mistress. Can I give a shot out from my ladies in their 30s? (Ill even take 41 if its Kerri) Ladies: I cook like a pro, I clean like an OCD kid, and I have the hands of a hm well, my hands win prizes. I dont know what I can liken them to. Ive dexterity, artistic competency. You can check references if youre not convinced. Come now throw me a bone (/your panties). Its been a whole two months now that Ive had to be celibate. Think of me as a kinked hose. I get into trouble misdirecting my lust. Youre all fair game until Ive someone in my bed again. So Ive got Crumpets camera. She left it here. If I was a different kid (or maybe me at another age) Id take dirty pictures of myself and put them on her memory card. Hm. Thats a good idea, dirtykins! Btw, LTWR girls you want a moniker for me? heres the one the boys gave me: 5-pack Charlotte. cause Ive always had one before I show.

 Am I torturing myself by rehanging a sexy picture of me and the ex? I went through the files and reprinted another hi-res copy of my favourite pic taken by the two of us back when things were still wonderfully lustful and nothing more. You remember this one: yet I think Im over it. I miss her, sure. But like the cat, she wasnt designed to stick around. Vato wanted to be outside, so I let him. Kerri wanted to have a fuck-buddy, so I played along until I got too emotionally involved. Ok, so Im not really comparing her to a cat. I dont really like the cat. This line of thinking isnt going anywhere. It took me all of three minutes to get over the cat disappearing. Kerri had me with a broken heart for well, about two months. That isnt too long either, Id say. So the photo is up. Fuck it. We look hot, and thats all that matters now. Appearances. Im being a bad lesbian. Are you all watching the news as much as I am? The sound byte coming out of the Enron investigation, that huge ape-like woman in the blue shirt and dark jacket talking about what information is bound to come from the investigation of those who are making plea bargains? Ooohhhh. SO nasty looking, that chick. Sorry, but the public at large (no pun I mean the folks in between the coasts), they see this woman, an easily identified lesbian. And shes *so* unattractive. Theres a fine line being played with our visibility. I dont subscribe to the notion that all visibility is good visibility or any other radical/desperate stance on making queers a part of the mainstream. These are the images my parents see and (thankfully) see that I dont fit within that mold. Shes not out there as a rep for queer culture, I realize. But whatever we do, we are representatives of our entire selves. So Queer Eye for the Straight Guy is a runaway hit. Good. But is it? Five /very/ effeminate men acting the part of the most stereotypical of roles. Remember kids, this is all a lot of folks will ever see of gays. At least Queer as Folk manages a diverse cast of characters, however spliced with so much graphic sex that no one will ever get past an episodes opening scenes. (but isnt Melanie hot? Mmm that tummy) Is Howard Dean worth our vote? Really, Im asking here. Im planning to vote Republican until I see a Democratic candidate who tickles my fancy. Im a bad citizen right now; I havent spent the time to research their platforms. All I know is that Im a fan of small government. And in saying so, I hope the military expenditures decline significantly. Yet, now that weve engaged the issue in Iraq, its completely irresponsible to back away at this point. You cant change horses midstream, and I mean that in terms of vision and political positions, not just a policy maker. Oust Bush if you can still behave responsibly. If you can still back the position our country has already taken with this situation. Do what you like when its over.

 Mom took me out this morning to go shopping. First to Price Club and then to the nursery for roses. Walking through the aisles in the warehouse, I was struck by a wave of loathing. That feeling when your whole soul rejects the assault of marketing, consumer culture and how pathetic it is, how false. I felt embarrassed for people, for the folks who cast this stuff out expecting for us to bite. I could have cried. Because its empty, unfulfilling. Yet it tries so hard to reach us and mean something. I havent been sensitive to this since my new drugs. But there it was. The weight of our human weaknesses. All these products wanting our attention, our praise and acceptance. Yet all of it looking painfully unnecessary. The rejection. Saying no to so much. I felt sorry for inanimate objects. I felt guilty for walking away. My spirits lifted upon arrival to the nursery. Sunshine in Encinitas, one of the better places for roses (hundreds of varieties). I knew what I wanted, but it took my mothers expertise to nail down three that fit my wants. I felt proud next to her. My mom, the green thumb. The woman with the knowledge and profound sensitivity to these living things. She has more plants than god, and none ever go neglected. It was genuine pride warming my heart watching her talk to the woman in gloves and dirt on her face who offered to help lift them into our cart. She knows the scientific names to everything. I hardly uttered a word until I realized it was my decision to make, which breed I wanted in my yard. I chose a white one (JFK), a yellow one (Kings Pride or something), and my favourite, the orangey/yellow fruit-smelling oh, shoot. I forget what its called. But I know theyll be beautiful. Im pretty great with plants myself. Theres an element of primal gratification in nurturing plants. A primal connection to the earth that I love to experience. Im blessed that I take after my mom that way. Im blessed to have her as my model, my guide until I learn more from her. I stood there beside her fully aware that I was learning from her, that a generational passing along of knowing was occurring. I suddenly imagined the day I lose her, when Ill be wishing Id absorbed more of her world. On a completely separate note You know what I worry about? The homeless who live on the streets in the northeast. Are they being looked after? They certainly cant endure the cold. They need the help of the city, their fellow citizens. Will these news networks please report on their welfare? Stop scaring us about possible dangers (Do French fries cause cancer? Find out at 11) and instead give some information on whats being done to help? I want to hear about solutions, you guys. Warm my heart with some good news. Youre on 24/7. certainly theres room for it. some photos from the party:

 Well, hes a gonner. The crowd of people at the party must have scared him away. I havent seen him in a long time now no sign of him having been here since the party. I should be more upset, but I never did get to bond with the thing. He was always such a bitch. RIP, Vato. I bet you gave a good fight before being devoured by a coyote. Speaking of predators, I had a starring role at the party as a sexual predator. Im not usually that forward, but it was fun and I know its safe to play around with Morgen. I hope I didnt leave any marks I remember biting Kerri once while drunk, and I broke the skin. Oopsie. Ive been a rather bad girl this week. I suppose Im getting it out of my system before the new term begins. I spent the entire day yesterday in bed, sleeping until 2pm and then going back to sleep at 4 until 8, then back to bed at 10 until 8am this morning. The hours I was awake, I spent under the covers drinking water and watching the tube. I felt fine, just sleepy from all the poisons circulating through my system and the added pain in my back that tires me out. And its nice to have the luxury of resting quietly for an entire day. Im due for a workout. Maybe Ill get custody of the dog after all, now that I no longer have a cat. Mom said I could have her. Hm keeping my fingers crossed for that.

 I needed a boob-fix today. Its fun having your own, but you know how it is Now this is nice. The sun is shining, theres football on the telly. Ive got shorts on with my legs proped up on the ledge of an open window while I sip on iced water with mexican limes thrown in for fun. Im planning a party and continuing to clean the house to break up stints of sitting still keeping various bits of furniture from floating away. Ive finally broken the threshold of chub that I accumulated over the semester. Down six pounds this week, and thats even after the heavy lifting that bulked me up noticeably. So the day spent in gym shorts and a wife beater is even more comfortable than its been. It feels good to take care of myself. Time for some recipe searches for Tuesday nights party. Maybe Ill propose we make up some mojitos for the featured beverage for the night. Mole sauce sounds good. Maybe chicken marbella. Something outside of my usual repertoire.

 The darkening sky has me sitting beneath the help of artificial lights this afternoon. Keeping warm with my collection of latin music, mainly this hour: El Conejo with this sweet young boy hollering the lyrics: Ay vyanse preparando Ay vyanse preparando Que el conejo ha de salir Bscalo aqu bscalo all Que el conejo ha de salir Ay vyanse preparando Ay vyanse preparando Que el conejo ha de salir Bscalo aqu que bscalo all Que el conejo ha de salir Como que te va te va Como que te viene viene Como con tu lindo abrazo Vgalme dos que este si es dolor Arrulladito me tienes Como que te vas te vas Como que te vienes vienes Como que tu lindo abrazo Bscalo aqu bscalo all Arrulladito me tienes I dont know something about a rabbit. Any excuse to get cozy in soft cashmere and my waterproof brown and black Clarks is bueno with me. I plan a walk in the downpour once in arrives. Maybe drive to a park where the colours will saturate better than this dusty construction zone of balding chaparral. I love the smell of rain. When I was young, my now deceased grandmother could smell the ozone right before it came down. It was like watching a seer, her signal in a smile to us that the thirst for rain was over. I miss her. The rain reminds me. Rain, misty eyes, passionate songs of a world once-removed from mine its just one of those days, I suppose. Days I appreciate, extended moments of connectedness enhanced by atmosphere more lasting than usual. Children playing outside on Canvas Street, the one not yet built on. Parents standing by with remote controllers in their hands queued up to high speed cars that whine as they reach speeds of over 40mph, the children playfully trying to outrun them. Hispanic folks who could be my neighbours for all I know. Im blessed to live here among a native population of another culture. Im suddenly nostalgic for the backstreets of Mazatlan. For the sometimes nauseating smells of the markets, weaving through the aisles of freshly killed game and the vibrant colours of produce. Nostalgia for a sensory assault of another world. I must meet Bryan to make the day a public experience, a shared experience. Its not everyday I lust for reentrance into the public sphere, hear the call to indulge in the natural environment. If only Id driven up to Julian to appreciate the storm up there, with my parents, safely inside their spacious new home with great windows looking out into the hills and horizon.

 The LiveJournal server is down... damn it! No parallel uni tonight. Here's my Vato humping my leg. Who says I don't get any sex these days?

 Ha! Judgement Day has arrived, and I find myself in the sweet arms of salvation, all woes rectified, all justice doled out to those whove stood in my way! Today was the premiere class for the Queer Studies course Im taking (along with my four favourite LGBT group members). Never before have I felt so comfortable in a class. Where I no longer had to govern my mouth and thoughts to filter out my sexuality. Where I had the complete backing of not only my classmates (many of them, anyway), but the professor as well. Total comfort. And in a subject I swear Im gifted at reading. Film classes taken so far total four at the university level. I spoke up more today than I ever have in any class. We watched some poor production value obscure thing from 1986. three vignettes about relationship intimacy. The first, a lesbian and a straight woman agreeing to have sex, an oral contract being formulated on the bounds and concerns. The second, two men having sex in a bathroom stall, an oratory coupling, with all the intimacy of a handshake. The third, a straight man and woman having paid-for phone sex, another oral connection, the woman lying about herself and having little to say when it comes to fantasizing about sex, and the man pleasing himself while he willing submits to the lies. Terrible production values, but it was fun to pick apart and discuss it as a class. Had to bite my tongue so as not to dominate the discussion with too many of my opinions and insights. I always have so much to say about the technical aspects of direct filmmaking like these things. Theyre not too subtle in general. And shoot, when Rallin polled the class, How many of you are familiar with reading films, have taken other film studies courses? I was THE ONLY ONE of 50 or so who raised her hand. The film the third scene elicited quite a bit of laughter. This woman after all is being paid to have phone sex. Yet she quickly runs out of vocabulary, the space filled in instead with lots of yeahs and repetition. He asks, after the usual vanilla scenario having been played out, what else shed do to him. Not an ounce of creativity, the woman goes on to basically repeat said scenario. How lame! SMBD? Anal? Different locations/positions? Toys? Groups? Power play? Sheet, mayn. Theres too much possible to have a loss for words. Finally to end the conversation when the words completely dried up, she says shes busy and tells him to call back another time. SUCH a commentary on vanilla heteros. Thats it?! I mean, I think gay people have the upper hand there, the skill of inventing new ways of getting off than the expected standard for what constitutes sex. Most of us do, I suppose. Look at our past Pres, Mr. Bill Clinton. He tried to say that oral isnt sex. Ah-hem. No one buys that, yo. But isnt intercourse the traditional standard that others measure other acts. What /is/ sex? Do you have to finish for it to be good? Does there have to be some kind of penetration? Is anal not sex? Yeah, problematic indeed. This class is going to rock. And Rallin is this adorable gay man, middle eastern, silver hoop earrings to compliment the over 50 thin bangle bracelets on his left arm. Twirling as he speaks, searching for the exact phrasing he wishes for. Very smart (dresser), very articulate, very adorable. I would have cried in protest if the class was taught my some stodgy old straight person. His face is so beautiful. Why are gay men more attractive to me than straight ones? (no threat to my autonomy, I suppose. And theyre nicer, dont let their penises ruin the whole entanglement) Lets see how many people did we scare away with the class content and sexually suggestive film? Maybe ten in total I dont know. Someone was counting. I just sat back self-assured that their departures would only serve to make the class environment more enjoyable, less contentious. Shit, this film was polite. No nudity, no penetration I could have shown it to a high school class. I see more sex on daytime soaps. (Ok, no. I dont watch them I dont really have a leg to stand on there, comparing it) Im off to buy some beer and smokes, a reward for a thrilling day of bravery encouraged. Sun setting in the west, fires in the facing windows.

 a couple of dumb but funny images i ran across today... urlLink chicks urlLink roadlesstaken

 More time spent in the waiting mode in doctors offices. Yesterday was a trauma involving tears and extreme panic at Student Health Services where I received my very first EKG. Nothing conclusive came out of it, save for a bit of insistence that I go in to see my primary physician as soon as possible. Theres definitely an irregularity, an arrhythmia that builds on itself when I notice it and panic further. I almost fainted a couple of times, my anxiety was so great. Thinking to myself, I could totally have a heart attack as a result of the damage Ive inflicted on my body. So my heart skips again, then pounds hard to make up for the pause. More tears roll down my face into my ears as I lay back, trying to revert to meditative breathing, trying to think it away and realizing it might all be in my head. I got right in to see my doc this afternoon (after sleeping 16 hours to see if it was just stress aggravating the condition). He doesnt know either, says theres nothing conclusive in the EKG. Same deal as yesterdays vague prognosis. So I got a referral to a cardiologist. Im not too scared right now. My mom has PVC, my brother went in to check his heart too. No history of heart trouble in the family. Still it makes me anxious, like Im always on the verge of a panic attack. It very well could be a reaction to the drugs Im on. Ill say more when I know. Vato got his new black leather spiked collar today. How handsome is my boy? I also received my lesbian porn comic book that Ive been excitedly looking forward to adding to my coffee table entertainment. Its kind of hot for black and white cartoons. (jewish mother voice) Who knew? urlLink Author's LiveJournal site . Deep breath exhalation. Accelerated pounding in my chest. In between Perrier belches. No coffee, no alcohol, no workouts. Now what?!

 Oh my lord, yall. What a fucking freightening day. I began waking at an early hour, troubled by a dream I had semi-lucid about a screenplay I was certain that needed to be written. Involving desperate paralysis and silence. The details of which have since been rendered unnecessary to elaborate on. So Im sitting in Mouks class in the corner but in front when I pull out a VW novel Im at the dnouement of and just flirting with the conclusion I was prepped for reading/seeing the HOURS. When I knew (Shit, Charlotte. Youre so sequestered off. Why not use this time before class more wisely and talk to those around you who youve clearly had several classes with over the years. Why go introverted?) So I put the book down. Talked LONDON with a boy wanted to fuck him by the end of it (Belle de Jour?) but I talked LONDON with the guy until class was underway. And then my heart started. Again. Ive almost become used to this feeling. Beating hard, then nothing. I was trying to breathe in all my Yoga and Meditation-trained ways. And believeyoume, Ive been that route. But my heart hurt, kept pounding. I was scared, began to feel faint. So I disengaged myself from Mouks placid/flaccid lecture. But it didnt stop. I wanted to cry out. I thought I was dying, the ?ith time this week or two. Ive never had heart probs in my life. Even encompassing a good five year CONSISTENT stint of main-line (shit, this is ruining my political career), freebasing (all the time cause its a different high and I like glass pipes SO FREUDIAN-), and snorting it until my nose bled without stop for hours. If you ever see it happen? Its old shit. Im ruined. I thought I was going to die. It got worse and more cramping as I thought of it. Really this morning Ive done drugs like COKE and E and METH and ACID and MESCALINE, and MUSHROOMS, and EPHEDRINE, and CRACK, and more chronic than most should have in a lifetime, imagining that this life form ingested a seasoned-smokers view of a daily dose of 60/1/4 dope (even knowing the grower, getting mind-numbing shit all day for 240 an oz. or 45 a if times were tough.) I blew a 3g gift to me from my folks at 18 that I spent on speed. At $10/g. in large quantities. And I still messed it up, the delay, the innocence. Then I read about Belle de Jour. I alternately want to be her, and I want to absorb her experience. No, I just want to meet her as contemporaries. She rules. I site her more often than Plato.

 oswald who? i'd like to do some private target practise myself.

 i hate him. i want him slapped. i'd want him dead, but unlike him... i can love his "life" even though i wish it was stopped short by a "Accidental" train-wreck happening before him. Fucking gay-basher. i'm going to do what i can to silence the fucker. oh, yes... the war is on!

 I'M ---SOOOOO---- NOT VOTING FOR BUSH THIS TERM! fucking marriage tax fear-stirrerererer. or whatever. so pandering to heteros. i could run his undies up the flagpole with him in them for that ten seconds of his State of the Onion address alone. i'd have said this earlier if i was home to see it live. and yes, i watch this shit live. i'm a hound for political mud-slinging. i now hate him. a 300' turn ( i save 60 degrees because i've always thought of him as the born-again wacko we've all been briefed on). and shit, even Dean has panic attacks. i voted for this guy? god damn, the hypocrisy of REPs. GROW UP! (note viewers: you're witnessing the second step to Yours Truly's slow change from a republican to a DEM. I went the first step; going to LIB. but they're way out of the public's concern, the national weight they need. settle somewhere that your butt on the seat registers. fuck that guy. i thought he was going to say... while talking about medical advances, that he was going to give the green light to stem cell research. Ooops! what channel am i watching? yeah, wrong guy. this is a man i suddenly want to wither away in a cloistered ranch in texas. most of you saying: "FINALLY?!!! DUH!!!" sorry... but tonight i've shifted. fuck that guy. i pray that one day we have a LIB with cred runnign for his post. but come on... it aint gonna happen this term. yet i still hate the idea of big government.... and if he says "families" one more time knowing who he's including... i'm a-gonna sock him. btw, they'll never quell the illicit drug problem. holy shit, look at us!! give me a break. it's a human-condition problem. we all, those who have addictive personalities, we all do what we do even though death is staring us in the face. how many times have i almost died on drugs?? and i have every advantage not to go that route? or to choose to destroy myself? (puzzled, but angry when i think of Bush) ----------------i'd like to fuck his wife. is this why he hates queers?-----------

 What a day. And good for me, I waited until I had a job well done behind me before I got into the rum tonight. It tastes better when Ive earned it. So the first day of school is behind me, and I have a split decision about my first two classes attended. The first, a bio course, will be an effortless slam-dunk. The other class, the Virginia Woolf seminar course, will require more of me than Ive ever had to put out (she said put out). Like a lecture to the class on a secondary source article about one of the texts and a 15 page paper. And what, 350 pages I have to read before next week? Im one of four undergraduates out of the 20+ enrolled. And theres group work. Ive got to buck up and hit some hard targets to fair well in this fight. Shit, Im about to learn something! Who knew a university experience could bring such a thing? One more bit of praise for the educational institution I patronize today, I saw it. The soul of the campus, the heart of the school is alive and beating. The new Kellogg Library is open beginning this morning. The lighting, like a museum (the Tate Modern, in fact except no view to the Thames). The stories upon stories of stacks like straight standing soldiers holding all the potential imaginable. I felt pride wandering in and out of that clean, ordered palace. Our school is born today. Another bodily comparison: The womb of the school, kids Im happy, can you tell? So back to the classes. What a drastic difference between the two. Lets see an intro 100 science class of over 60 people in a huge auditorium. All chatting away while the Swedish professor makes his way past the rude behaviour (why does he tolerate it? Was I this disrespectful when I was a freshman?) and tries to enunciate as best he can in his very /second/ language. Noticing we werent going to go too far with the lecture, he lets us out after 15 minutes. So I entered the hallowed halls of the library. So its a good thing, right? Juxtaposed with a 500-level author studies course with a professor I know and respect like hell, Dawn Formo. Im not the youngest in the class, but theres only one girl (who I know, and shes only 23) who beats me. the oldest is Wally, a man of 80! Whos in the grad program. I get intimidated listening to introductions being made by all these folks (women, come on theyre like all women) in the heat of writing their theses. I start to contribute my own contribution, feeling my ill heart (I need to get that checked out somethings wrong) cramp up and my pulse accelerate. I open my mouth and get out my name and my position in school and then I feel it. That always-present panic voice coming up my throat. I know if I speak, Ill sound like Im speaking to my dead grandmothers corpse. So I brilliantly pause. Maybe too long, but I had to wait a full three seconds before I continued. Why are you taking the course? Well, shit! We all know why! Well, besides the lesbian angle. My all-time favourite Filmed Play is _Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf?_! Sheet, dawg! Ive only got the movie poster repro on my wall in the living room! So I speak. Ive loved this film with an unnatural passion, yet I dont know what the title means. Kerri has my copy of the film. I want it back just waiting for the right time to ask for it back. I miss that movie. And as if I needed more reason to love Dawn Formo, she screens the film tonight!!! TO EXPLAIN THE TITLE! Like Edward Albee wanted to call the play The Exorcism, but one night he was taking a piss in Greenwich Village and he sees on the wall the graffiti Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf?. So it sticks in his mind and he doesnt know why. See? You learn things at school. Today, I felt something. Not so much by the end of the day, but earlier. (hold on, let me refresh mommys drinkie before I go here) Earlier, when I sat myself down in that chair in the big auditorium after the stair workout I so missed over break I sat down, glasses on, reading a VW novel and I stopped. I felt /there/. Just like VW writes about in her work, splitting the atom of a single moment, I felt exultant. The moment consolidated its parts into one whole. A whole I was into, if youll forgive the disgusting imagery. I sat there completely aware of myself, a student, a student whos in her element. Finally, after all these years of having panic attacks at school, crying instead of attending, trying to attend on drugs with a secret fear tucked into my shirt pocket. Instead of fucking up, I was there with open eyes and a capacity to absorb. Ive come a ways to be in that chair on what looks like my last semester. (do I need to repeat a C-?) Anyway, Im doing better than the fuck up I used to be. When I first met Kerri-Lou and was knee-deep in free-basing and hyphen-usage. Small victory, yo. Or maybe I big one, but Im not into praise. Drops your defenses and allows for you to stop working. Best to shrug and focus on the negative. What still need fixing. Whats still wrong? Like my cramping heart. All these meds + my lifestyle? (If it doesnt get better after I get some better sleep, I promise to go in. still though, Im frightened. I am. Shit, I am.) How about my weight? My sexuality? My mental illness? How about my talent for breaking up marriages? Hm My sequestered solitude? No, no how about my broken body? Thats something never to be fixed/eased in its impinging on my full flowering . Thats a good one to focus on. Stir up the frustrated paralysis summore. Thats where I shine in my persistence. Im a tiger, kids. Just align things so it sounds like self-abuse, and Im a bone fide genius.

 Up early this morning. Skipped the sleeping pills last night to ensure that Id wake up on time for school. And did I. I woke at 3:30 unable to get back to sleep. Just like the old days. Tossing and turning, wondering if I really could sleep more or whether I should just get up and shower. So Ive got school today. Three classes, one at night with Dawn. Fingers crossed that it goes ok. 15 weeks to a degree. Martha Stuart entering the courtroom today. Just a polite smile and a wave of her hand to her supporters? Why not jump on top of your car and start dancing? Nothing says innocent like some lame pandering to the crowd to detract from the issue. It appears from this vantage point that Kerry is going to get the nod from the Democratic Party as the guy to run against Bush. And you know, had it been anyone else I would have voted for Bush like I did four years ago. But since he did so well in Iowa, Im about to do something Ive never done before; Vote Dem. His stance on GLBT issues are enough for me, but additionally hes not going to back off the war in Iraq, positioning our country in a bad spot changing our minds. Make a decision and back it up with a unified front. We just have to finish what we started. Change your foreign policy later. Dean just scares me. Did you see him after the caucuses were over? His shouting to the crowd and that primal scream he let out? Jesus Christ. I can just see him jump over the desk to tackle a detractor.

 Anyone interested in seeing the town I lived in, Bolzano?

 i'm fucking sick of feeling depressed, oppressed, smothered with social pressure and the calamities of the world around me. i want to let my hair down, be free in my own individual sense, to forget the images that haunt my memory tonight. at the end of that documentary, i spoke quietly to myself; "I need a drink after that one." and i went for a few hours later once i got home and found myself completely alone. i still see those mangled faces, still transpose those traumas on my own mug... i can't help but ingest some of the blunt/burden of such attrocities. i can't get them out of my head. but i can drink them away. i feel like emailing my reactions to aneil, my prof. but first, i think i want to ask him if it's ok/appropriate first. if he'll allow me the outlet.

 and another too stupid /not/ to post... how i feel racing along the freeways in my "vintage" 1990 nissan maxima.

 That last post was far too serious to follow it up with this... Who's ready for the SuperBowl?!!

 What an incredible day. I mean, so much happened, not all good. But when was the last time I had such a full day without feeling taxed by its end? Up early for the SOC meeting in the Field House to represent the LGBT group. I spoke up, made motions and seconds, and generally participated more than any of our group has in the past. I felt saucy. Awake (although carrying my usual hangover). And "on". Manic but not spinning my wheels into a rut of futility. Afterward, this girl comes up to me and says, What does LGBT mean? What club is that? It means Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered. Its just too many words to keep saying every time I make a motion. Oh, cause me and this girl were like, I think shes part of the LESBIAN club. Yeah, ok. That is a lot of words to have to say. Funny. An awkward attempt to connect, Id say. But amusing all the same. I watched her. Obviously she felt funny saying the L-word while I stood there calmly smiling at her fumbling with the interaction. A young woman. immature. yet bold enough to engage it. I ran into two people that warrant mention. First, I saw Fritz. My savior councilor of last semester from the school who I no longer see and can no longer really talk to since the relationship has reached its official end. We exchanged heartfelt smiles and walked our separate ways. I had such a hard time... He has earned a place in my heart. Then if this was real, I still cant believe it. I swear on my libido that I saw Tony Flowers today. Walking into the library through the front door, I saw him for a minute while I stood out front of Starbucks a good thirty feet away. It was him, I swear it. For those of you who know of my Tony this is a monumental run-in. I didnt say anything then decided to let out a cautiously inquisitive, Tony? No response. But then it was a timid inquiry. Theres too much else to talk about to go into the Tony saga in detail right now. Suffice it to say, this was my best friend for four years, my roommate for one year, my confidante and salvation during the darkest hours of the Claudia soul-sucking and my meth partner, a mutual addiction that went so far I cant believe Im still alive. This is a man who saw me puking into the sink after doing a line. saw me pulling out my hair after being up for three days. A man who I watched playing cards with the wall (with no cards). I knew this man intimately yet never sexually. And then one day he up and left town. Didnt say goodbye to anyone. Just moved away. No one knew where he went. Even his friend since elementary school didnt get the privilege of an explanation. Thats the last I knew of him. So you get it? What today was? That was five years ago. that was a whole other life I lead, a stint of nightmarish pain long since put safely away and there it was. I dont know if I want to revisit that. I don't know if I wanted him to respond. I schmoozed with my Queer group, discussing the morning meeting and the upcoming plans for our functions this semester. Too many details to recount, too much minutia not interesting to yall. But I did invite an outsider to sit in on our class today, our Queer Film class. We did our introductions today, and I spoke clearly and confidently without a glitch of self-doubt. A monumental achievement having me speak so casually and comfortably in front of a crowd about myself in a queer context. Big It extended into the group discussions too. speaking intelligently, to the point, with insight and concision. Im proud of myself. But the film we watched in class brought the whole day to an emotional halt. We screened Licensed to Kill, a film from 1997 about hate crimes against gay men. Crime scene footage juxtaposed with interviews with the men who killed them. A sympathetic interview style elucidating the psychological profiles of the men who turn violent enough to murder homosexuals. Now, the approach elicited some form of understanding for the troubled souls who would do such a thing. But at the same time, the heavier weight was listening to these tales of grisly homicides. Seeing these beautiful boys, some bludgeoned to the point where theyre faces were nothing but a mess of smeared flesh stirred about the bloody pulp that used to be their smiles missing fingers, ears torn off, corpses stabbed dozens of times And seeing all of this I was in tears by the end of it. Remembering my brothers abandoned moment of grief when Lincoln was murdered under the same circumstances. His boss took home a nice, cute guy from a bar to his fashionable upscale apartment in Hillcrest. Lincoln, the established and refined gentleman in his late prime, very successful, very congenial. The man he brought home...he flipped out and beat Lincoln to death, beaten from the waist up. The guy later confessed to the murder to the police, citing his disgust with himself for feeling desire for men as the reason for his violence. Lincoln Aston, beaten to death by a man who couldnt handle the implications of his own sexuality. My brother, crouched on the floor at my mothers feet crying and grieving and shaking his head the same year I came out. I watched all of that, but I couldnt mourn with him. I didnt want to make him fear the same fate would befall me. I didnt want to be with him in fear that my presence would remind him that Im gay too. Today was loaded. My eyes remained bloodshot and blurry for about an hour. Theyve since resumed that not-so-attractive appearance. But I wanted to wait until I was alone to indulge in a good moment with the pain. It feels good to engage the emotions. Not to cry outright, but to let it fill me with an ache thats so pure, the tears come in measured drops as if i've been filled and am gently overflowing. Be in the pain, not sob it away just let it be calmly in my core. So much pain in the world. So much I cant contain. But I can feel the limit of it, just how much I can conceptualise and let in at once. And its not too much after all. Not enough to make me destroy myself to stop it. A big day. More meeting with the group that resulted in some concrete plans to be present on campus. A much needed validation that my being queer is having some impact on a world that would destroy us if it had the chance. There are plenty of people out there who would murder me if they had the chance. That's a lot to think about... And then the day ended with the long walk to the parking lot with my favourite boy in the group, Terence. I just adore him for so many reasons. We talked about assimilation, separatism, fuck-buddies, intellectual compentence in a lover, and the importance of hot, messy, lusty sex in a relationship. We spoke of the inescapable framework of heterosexual relationships and how they exist as reference points for queer connections. And he spoke of his disillusionment with dating, his giving up on trying to meet someone, his assumption that All Relationships Are Doomed to Fail (i.e. The Meat Purveyors.. whose CD I got another copy of THANKS to Dana!! Yeah!! If only I could go forth and multiply this goodness for all of you to drink in!!). And I spoke with him of my rocky road to this point, my chosen life of alienation and seclusion behind my computer monitor until I feel Im ready to put myself out there again. it was a genuine connection made. And it was the perfect way to cap an intensely real day. Terence hugged me after the film. For a long time. Hes good like that. If I was looking to breed, I would look to this man. And with that, Im done. A big day. More than I could write about, really for what took place today, this post is so inadequate maybe Ill reflect more on it in the coming days and address more later. For now, I need to sit back and ingest.

 So Im going to start running again. its settled my back should be able to handle it again, at least by now a full year and a half since the big surgery. Along with that, it sounds like Bryan has his sights set on a woman. His self-confidence is so low, more or less manifest in his girth, hes not sure he has a leg to stand on to get her attention that way. So I offered to help. Were going to make a point of walking together with our cameras on Tuesdays in between my classes. I need the respite of a gentle workout, he needs the routine of getting out there and feeling good in his body. Im still a bit wiped out from the four days spent miserable in bed. Gathering up my sheets and shuttling them downstairs to the laundry facilities was enough to put me flat on my back for a minute or so to catch my breath. I absolutely soaked my sheets in sweat so many times, they need a bleaching and the down comforter needs a washing as well. Shoot, even coughing makes me dizzy like I inhaled NO2. its been a while since Ive be so humbled by illness. Outside of my regular hangovers and smokers cough. So tonight is a make-up evening. Less tv, more cleaning to get my life in order. Being so sick and being so all on my own equaled a mess of a house. Puke pans littering the floor and table tops. And all the rest that goes with trying to take care of myself without any help. One might assume that Id say here, I wish I lived with someone to help me during moments like this. But I dont. being alone relieved me of the guilt of having to depend on someone, of dependency, of exposing them to what I caught. I got by ok. And there was no turning on the faucet to mask the horrendous sound of my retching. I had mom close by, an easy seven digits away, to get advice from and soak up sympathy. I had the pharmacists phone number to verify that taking flu meds wouldnt interfere with my mental drugs. No problem.

 and if i hear one more person say "comeback kid" in relation to the democratic contenders, someone's going to get hurt. i need to change the channel. Gay Stand-Up Comedy on comedy central this coming monday at 10pm. fyi.

 Will someone please email a copy of urlLink this story to both my parents?! It wouldn't mean the same coming from me...

 Ok, you all. I need your help. Maybe not help so much as support. Yes, a call for your support. It has now been two days since Ive had a cigarette, and Im going to take this opportunity to finally quit. Ive quit before, for years at a time, sometimes only for several months. But when youre coughing blood, its a good indication to aim for any length of time I can manage. So help me out. There will be no bar hopping this week, no parties. Not until feb 7ths get together. If you see me in between classes, chat it up with me; make sure Im not eying the kids in the smoking zone in Founders Plaza. Chide me relentlessly if I lapse. I need help. Shit, kicking crystal is easier. Trust me. Behavioural replacements are as follows: meditative breath. That works wonders. Chewing on straws and other calorie-free objects. The oral fixation is tough; a shot out to the gals to bestow upon me anything that may come to mind here. And of course, more exercise. I did the usual trick of throwing out the cigs (broken), the ashtrays in the trash, and I nearly killed myself cleaning out my car and sterilizing any trace of smoking out of it. It helps not to smell it. Even the icky stale stench. Its against my character to smoke. I want to quit.

 a whole lot more of reading to do... so now, some more writing: I suppose theres a freedom is being under the weather. I can excuse my desire to stay in bed and sleep for an excessive amount of time as being a measure of taking care of myself, not merely the behavior of a sloth or recluse. A cat, maybe. Ive got one black furball lounging casually in the sun streaked portion of the room. If I could stand light on me while I sleep, Id crawl over there and curl up next to him. Ive reached a saturation point with the Virginia Woolf diaries. They no longer strike me with the same power as the first 100 pages seemed to bring. Perhaps thats just because I read them all at once, more or less. Entries spanning years, topics repeating themselves as time wears on and different books are published. So now Ive finished the 160p necessary for class tomorrow, aware that I still need to read her Complete Shorter Fiction by tomorrow night as well. I need to change it up though. For today, at least. Too much from one voice creates a hard of hearing effect in me; the familiarity wears the texture away like a piece of smooth glass too long spent churning in the tides. I have some Biology reading to do. Surprisingly enough, that sounds like a welcomed respite from Woolf. Something concrete and factual, involve the other half of my brain. A complete departure from being steeped in the inner world of a creative genius and troubled madness.

 Good, god, I can hardly breathe. Looks like a good time to stop smoking; I went all day yesterday abstaining. And today? I can hardly breathe enough to sit up, let alone to introduce foreign toxins to my laboring lungs. My breath is audible no matter how I try to get oxygen. Im weezing out a cough like an 80 year old cancer patient with emphysema. I thought it best to lay low and skip classes. For the sake of others and because I dont know how Id walk up all those steps if the one flight in my house takes a moment to recover from. I had an appointment to have my long-defunct garage door to be fixed today. Appointment was scheduled for the afternoon after 11:30, presumably the time when I would be back from school. But of course, I was sleeping. So I got up at 11:30, put some clothes on, and I walked downstairs to make coffee and brekkie. To find a note IN MY HOUSE from the garage dude saying he waited around until 11:30 and left finally when I didnt show. Waited around? In my living room or what? One, he blew the time. Now I have to wait even longer to have a working unit. And two, who one earth finds it appropriate to break into someones house? Leave the note on the front door, yo! BTW, I was up in my room with the door open sleeping naked while this gentleman was in here. Does anyone else find this problematic? I called their company for a reschedule, doing my best not to get angry. I dont have the lung capacity. Went to get the mail. No check. Just two letters, one threatening to turn off my phone, the other to remind me how over the limit one of my credit cards is. No check = nothing I can do about it. Im just stalling until I get a job in a couple of months. I hate being broke. I hate knowing how bad my credit rating is having rung up two of them to total 3,000 in the time since I lost my ability to work. But what can I do? Creditors call all day, but I screen. My gas tank is empty. So I really do have to wait until that check arrives before I can do anything, go anywhere. I was going to throw a dinner party this weekend, but I cant afford to be doing things like that. especially when I have the chance to babysit instead. I need money! Shit, I want a cigarette, but I cant imagine what that will do to my lungs. Guess Ill have to skip it and read a book instead to distract me. Or hell, scrounge up some change and go buy some cold medicine. Except that I already did the change scrounging for smokes a couple of days ago. haha, the irony.

 Good god, the server is slow tonight. I even fired up the laptop in case the delays had anything to do with my system. But of course that didnt help. Every site I try and it says that I have my full dial-up speed working for me. hmph the dependence on technology. What are you gonna do? So, one of my assignments for the term is to keep a diary a la Virginia Woolf documenting my weekly impressions of the material Im reading. It can be about just about anything; form is not an issue. Just to reflect intelligibly about the texts. Why not post it as a new blog? So Im creating one, provided that my internet gets up off the couch and takes out the trash like I asked it to an hour ago. I hope it comes off as interesting to others, not just me and my prof. urlLink Virginia Woolf Diaries

 Now heres something to brighten my day, a date to look forward to. The University of California annual GLBTIA (oh, yes. Its longer than that) conference is being held at UCSD this year! Hooray! And Our university going to pay for our admission! A whole weekend of networking, learning, a little partying, and a whole lot of checking out women! Woo-hoo! Maybe Ill get some contacts going for future employment. Is there room in the queer community for a writer? Certainly the life of an activist is an emotionally draining one. But so is wasting my potential waiting tables to pay the bills. More importantly what am I going to wear?

 what a SHITTY class period we just had. queer studies is no longer a class i look forward to attending. here's my post-class post. Yikes! Next time Ill do a little shadow boxing in the hallway before coming. Or resign myself to the position of silence so many of you have taken in class discussion. Personally, I dont like having conversations imbued with so much confrontation. Being angry doesnt facilitate my learning. Today There wasnt a whole lot of room for actual discussion, with actual listening, with respect for opposing opinions or viewpoints not deemed valid (without rudely shutting people down). Its so valuable to be able to talk about this /together/, and I think, like many others, that todays class denied that possibility. Terence, Im sorry you were shut up. And the guy whose comment was deemed bullshit later on. I dont know your name, dude. Forgive me. Ive got a lot of homework for my four other classes that Ive put on the back burner somewhat in favour of attending to this class. I need to get back to that. See you next week. And I look forward to hearing your responses to the film. Ill write mine next week. Charlotte Conrad

 I cant believe this world. Yet look at me; Im watching this stupid show. Extreme Make-Overs on ABC. Yes, Ive sunk so low. Network television, prime-time. And this spectacle, exploiting peoples insecurities about their appearances. Im horrified. Im much rather watch Insomniac. Im on my way to bed; I dont want to see bloody nose jobs in my sleep. Mustard-glazed short ribs and mushroom risotto for dinner. A lemon-lime souffl for dessert. Yup, just getting my sea legs back. I havent been in the kitchen much lately.

 aw... thank you, belle. you've again changed the focus of the night for me. from imagined prostitutes to the real deal. (how much does the following service cost, and where can i sign up?) He: (setting the dresser mirror on the floor) "I want to watch you watching yourself masturbate." Well, this makes a change. Ask and ye shall receive. "What with?" "Your hands first. Then a vibe." "And then you...?" "No, I just want to watch." He provided a chair and I sat. Wriggled out of my knickers and drew the skirt of my dress around my hips. There it all was, on display, as I'd rarely seen. Yes, I usually do a spot check after waxing and before going out, but this was different. And hand mirrors feature strongly in both work and sex at home, but this was just me, alone, inviolate. Belle from a fly on the wall. And being the self-obsessed creature I am, I was possibly as fascinated as he. I watched my lips grow fuller, redder, wetter. Much darker than I imagined, almost purple, as I've seen the head of a penis do so many times. The aperture itself widened and gasped. I could hear its gentle smacks like a mouth opening and closing as my hand rubbed faster and my hips moved less gently. The effect was of watching myself on television. I suppose it must have been for him as well - he paid far more attention to the reflection than to me in the chair. I wondered why bother with the expense of paying someone to masturbate when there was no interaction, then realised. He wanted to be the director. But as I approached the point of no return I would slow down and readjust my position - ostensibly to give him a better look or varied position, but really to keep myself from coming. It was remarkably difficult to keep from setting off the hair-trigger for most of the hour. He sat on a bed, then knelt on the ground, coming closer and closer to the mirror, occasionally making requests regarding the speed and action of the vibe or the location of my free hand - but didn't touch. When he came, it hit the glass, sliding thickly over my reflected image onto the carpet. // posted by belle @ 6:17 AM

 If you could hire a prostitute, what fantasy would you have them fulfil? I just have to ask this question. Some folks get off on cops those fabulous leather boots, the authority. Some like Japanese schoolgirls. And well, what I like is plainly obvious to all. I want my teachers. An intensely erotic dream about Heather Hayton last night paired with a brief moment of unexpected (yet innocent) intimacy with Dawn tonight my thing for Kristen, a lust shes well aware of and still plays with me in letters. Shit, do I need to list the others? Ive only two hours until midnight. Can someone find me a call girl who can recite Donne to me, lecture me on the death of the author, and then submit to a good old fashioned ravishing by yours truly? Walk me through the demands of the Chiapas rebels as I give her head? Anyone? Anyone? Alas, Im left to my own imaginative longings. Longings that propel me to attend class, to gravitate towards women who can ignite this passion for learning. For intellectual orgasms as well as the toe-curling type. I had to answer the question tonight: Are you queer? I think the fact that I want to fuck those in power positions like I do qualifies me as such. To embrace the challenge and take the reigns, push the issue yet submit to pleasing these women, submitting instead of what the initiation implies. But I couldnt write as much in a public posting to the class listserv. Nor did I touch on the bondage bits. I had a lot to say for the queer class discussions, however filtered for public consumption. (I may wish I filtered the above raw admissions) We were to make a response of half a page to the 20+ page reading, then respond to two of our classmates. So I wrote a three page response. Responded to two people with a page+ for each. And then submitted 3 more posts to the general discussion part that does count for anything but acts as a place for me to add to the discussion. No one else is as intense as I am, of course. I plan to submit more tonight. As I finish this wine (so good, btw!). and before I take all my knock-out drugs. Its all about writing. Reading, writing, and lusting to fuck my professors. A point of distinction that some find strange/troubling: to fuck them, not be fucked. Anyway Gnight.

 Im high again tonight. Not on drugs, bien sur. Ive just had another blissful night of class in Dawn Formos Virginia Woolf seminar. Its so challenging and so insightful, I feel part of something worth while, something really at the heart of why I study literature in the first place. Were delving into the nature of biography as a dishonest classification. Into the perceived necessity for plot in the novel. Talking about so many things that spark my lust for knowing. Or at least thinking, considering complicated subjects in depth, continually being challenged to think deeper. And engaging in conversation with some really educated minds. And hell, I even made a poignant contribution to the discussion tonight. Really nailed something about a hypothetical question we were asked about VWs writing, how we would understand her work if the class required only that we read _Jacobs Room_. Her novel was experimental in style and form and seemed a sketchbook of a novel in progress rather than a finished product. It felt like reading an outline of her creative mind, a precursor to her later work. Its more a necessary step before being able to write _Mrs. Dalloway_, the novel that followed _Jacob_. We stayed late and mulled over our presentation ideas. Dawn was impressed with the depth and breadth of our conversation having overheard part of it from the other side of the room. I just dig her. Bryan can testify here: (black Baptist voice can I get a witness?!) Shes perdy. Any accolades I receive from the woman register with added currency. I made her laugh earlier during group work, causing her to grab onto my shoulders as she stood beside us. Instinctively, I reached back and grabbed one of her hands. Maybe shouldnt have actually held it. Once it happened, I realised how intimate it was. I noticed the change within myself, the parts of my mind that felt a triggering. Yet I know her and she knows me. It seemed natural so natural. But then thats me. It wasnt awkward at all. She made no move to withdraw from the show of affection. It was nice, really. We like each other. On different levels, sure. I ended the night with all the firepower of a forward warming up in my best boots on a perfect pitch. A football/soccer reference if youre not used to the language. I wanted to run. I crave a run. It has already happened, you guys. I have the bug. I have the lust for pounding pavement. Its the more fulfilling thing. Even sex can be disappointing for a number of reasons. But running its the best sublimation activity on earth. It fills me. Its all I need to be whole. Alas, my ankle is throbbing as I write. And this after taking the whole day off. So I came home instead to a bottle of Kendall Jackson Pinot Noir and a sweet, soft feeling in my belly. I took off my shoes at the door as usual, placed them neatly with the sandals, and walked around on the fleshy new carpet in my sock with all the bliss of bare feet on wet grass. I had another moment of sudden and separated consciousness; when you slip out of the now and perceive time and experience more objectively, more universally. My home, my own, my safe and lovely place I have to come back to and indulge in my very individualised mode of living. I have such immeasurable personal freedom here. This is my sanctuary, and tonight I kiss it to thank the space for being here. For my being present enough to appreciate it. Oh, and just like that the rain starts up again. For those of you who know me, I worship the rain. Plan my funeral on a rainy day, ok? Something intense, dramatic passionate bursts of water rushing to the ground. I love it. Im so happy watching it come down here. Trickles of water streak my windows, set to a background of black and bits of yellow dotting the distance. Its never enough. Its a thirst this climate cant quench. When was I last as happy as I am tonight? You know, I think I could point to it. I can remember its not that rare of a thing these days. God bless my progress.

 Its funny, you all. How long have I been complaining that I would be fine if only I was able to run? How many years has it been since I was my super-fit self? Im going to guess its about three years now that I injured my spine. And ever since then Ive been kept off the streets, kept in resignation mode with a broken body. Two days now Ive gone for a run. I cant tell you how much saner I feel. Like, energetic, talkative, confident, happy and of course, Im in total pain. Walking gingerly down stairs (oddly, going up them uses different muscles) with aching quads, limping a touch from an ankle thats as swollen as a baseball (and fucking killing me as I sit, the blood rushing into it), and continually stretching a back that feels tight (however limited to muscular strain). It hurts so good! Its the good hurt Ive missed. I have to take today off to get the swelling down, sure. But Im all set to get out there again tomorrow and up my distance a half mile. Slow beginnings, big goals. Breakfast with Bryan at this shit hole in old San Marcos. Some pit that I didnt even have to ask the question, did this used to be a Boll Weevil? We ate omelets and talked about American foreign policy and the upcoming elections spent a little while musing over the paradox of the American legal system and the tenets of the Bill of Rights in light of queer justice and equal treatment. You know, surrounded by folks in their formal sweatpants eating steak and eggs with eyes glued to FOX news in place of making conversation. I havent been writing as much these days. On account of having been sick as well as the added work load being out for a week left me with. Im not nearly done with the 300+ pages I needed to have read for my Woolf class tonight. I feel so much pressure to be 100% prepared. Yet Im not the only one, I know, and I have a valid excuse for being a little behind. A fabulous dream about Hayton was interrupted in medias res this morning when the phone rang. A hotel room in Barbados it was lovely. Of course I couldnt fall back asleep and resume the fantasy where I left off. So tragic to have my only sex life derailed like that. Smoking log: 10 days, baby.

 The silly football game is still on. Im rather confident that my team (the one whose uniforms I like best) is on their way to winning although its tied and not at all clear about who has the upper hand. No, Im not a true football fan. Yet I feel obliged to watch it. Its the quintessential secular holiday in America. The game is fabulous, sure. Masterful athletes at their best it stirs that competitive spirit of our country to punctuate our inflated sense of nationalism. Why, I saw entire songs devoted to the remembrance of the shuttle crew that was lost a year ago today. Gee! How wonderfully sensitive! But the aspect of the Super Bowl that most captures my attention is the glut of commercial plugs interwoven into the event. As much reporting is dedicated to the best ads of the night than they attend to the game itself. How sickeningly American is this? The inseparable pairing of machismo dominance with the bliss of consumption. I wonder if the inventor of the game of American football designed it to allow for the maximum number of commercial interruptions? Im having an epiphanic moment here Yes! Thats it! Ill invent a game designed with commercials in mind! Ill hire some famous folks to endorse it, get people to think its cool then POW! CBS is calling me with a bid for the broadcasting rights. Woo-hoo. Workout Log- 100 sit-ups 10m on elliptical 30 push-ups 30m walk through campus stairs 10m running 3 sets of: 160lbs leg press x 20 30lbs bicep curl x 15 5 on the lat pull downs x 12 90lb quad leg lifts x 15 I was the first in the Queer Studies film class to post a response to the class discussion board (WebCT). Were supposed to write a response to the reading, then make two more posts in response to the writing of others. By Friday. And no one has done a thing. So since I have nothing else I want to say today, here you go: my post. Reading through the articles assigned to the class for this week, I had to stop half way through the first one I picked up to record some responses that werent fitting in the margins as annotations. Im reading the Savage/Julian article, Queering the Pitch: a conversation. Rather than give my impressions of the discussion in a rambling and disjointed focus, I think Id rather hone my thoughts to one or two specific topics; that of language, and in particular the language of the oppressor. The issue of language is obviously key to the discussion. The expropriation of the word queer is at the very heart of the conception of queer theory. Like as stated in the discussion, its resultant in the inversion of what was once a derogatory slur. Yes, this weighs in as a significant shift in power. To illustrate this better, lets think of the polarized factions within the abortion debate in America. One side clearly got the upper hand in the naming of their position; the Pro-Life camp. Their name, being a proponent of life, is not a viewpoint that many would attack. In naming their side Pro-Life, they have in effect secured a label for themselves that, taken literally, no one would defy. They won them the battle of linguistic supremacy. In language, the Pro-Life position has secured victory. This idea of a victory of language is just what the movement to reclaim the term queer has striven for and succeeded in possessing. The LGBTIA[etc.] community has taken the language of the oppressor and turned it inside out. Queer used to be a word uttered before getting your head kicked in. Now it signifies something wholly different. Its a semantic revolution. To the question of whether it is right to adopt the language of ones oppressors, one needs to look no further than a little bit of post-colonial discourse to speak to that. In any community in which one portion of the population colonises the other or occupies a position of power, the language of this dominant segment is honoured as the most legitimate. We can create our own language from the margins, but the only one that will carry true weight in the larger scheme (in the immediate sense) is the language of the powerful; the language that is spoken by the mainstream, the words known by the largest population. Rather than create our own linguistic label to call ourselves by, it is more impacting to take the word of our oppressors. To take it from them and to make it our own. This may seem problematic to some. My own education resists the practice of speaking the language of the oppressor. I think back to Choukris novel For Bread Alone. It was only until he learned to write classical Arabic that he became truly free. In a period of Moroccan history where a unifying conception of nationalism was uncertain, Choukri sided with his heritage. He chose to tell his story in his peoples language, not the French of the colonizers [or the Spanish of his more powerful neighbours. However, the narrative form of a novel itself is a Western/European construct that has been imported to the region another layer even still. For this example, it is not the language that succumbs to the colonizers but the medium.

 People of the Earth. Unite! Im getting a new cat this week. A reward para me for putting up with this feral beast. Maybe Ill continue my homage to Kristen and name it Vita. I need a nice cat. Fuck this nasty thing. A night of bliss with Bryan. I needed some good old fashioned happiness. I went to TipTop Meats and bought two porterhouse steaks that totalled 35 bucks. They turned out so luscious, we cut them with forks. Beef is essential to a girls happiness. We tried to watch a film Id hired from the library at school. Blowup. Sorry to tell you, but it was retarded. Unless youre dumbstruck by a young man in pegged white jeans. I want little more than a bowl of chronic tonight to quell the smoking fixation. Last night nearly dismantled my anti-smoking fortifications. Pots different. I should relearn to run on the high. Push me past the pain of my bulging ankle. I work through it each time I step out, but it takes me a good half mile to block it out. OK fine! This is what it looks like!:

 mmm... smells gooot. looks more lovely than i can capture.

 My plans for Valentines Day? Or should I call it by its proper name in the parlance of yours truly, Sublimate Your Desires Day. A little manual labour in the yard (pictures to follow) and maybe a nice run to substitute for a want for another form of hard, rhythmic breathing. And shoot, why not take the rabbit out and play with him for a while? Bryan: Howd the convo go yesterday with whatshisname? Me: Eh. Sick of rehashing. Waste of energy. Bryan: Did you call him a silly queen? Me: Right. No, I dropped my pants and challenged him to a pissing contest to settle the dispute. Bryan: Literally?

 fuck it. here's my other post, also thrown up on the lj site. i'm not up for mixing it up. i'm crushed, emotional, self-abusive, and i have a lot of energy lurking behind that shiny glaze of submission. not a good combo tongiht. __ i know none of you like to hear this when I admit a downward trajectory is upon me, but today has nudged me in that direction with all the subtlety of an H-bomb. All day, I wanted nothing more than to come home and crawl back under the covers to cry in private. Not to hit something. Just to cry. And since I tried to fight it today the feelings took a 180&#9702; turn and are feeding on themselves, on the vessel that attempted to confine them. Im going for sick tonight. Anyone who wants can come over (bring hard liquor, at least 750ml), prepare to slur your existential despair in concert with the master. Im up for one hell of a shut-it-out session. I feel like Ive been dumped. But this time, its getting dumped from a whole ideology. Alienated from my first chance to bring together my best, more defining characteristics. My writing, my film analysis talent, and my well developed sense of a queer self. Yes, some scotch and a film. Alone with my liquor and myself. The safest place to be.

 Im not angry. No, Im resigned and exhausted. The day wore me out, filled with an emotional hour that brought me down so far. But it worked out. I came to a decision that Im happy with. A decision thats freeing me to devote a whole lot more of my time to matters that matter. Im dropping the Queer Theory class. Being yelled at by a threatened Aneil today pushed me over the edge. I dont need this. I dont need this class. And Im not going to stick around if Im to curb my enthusiasm for the greater good. Im disappointed to hear a professor tell me my contributions are destructive because I post too much. Not that theyre not good points, just that Im participating too much. Im dominating the discussion. ?? Were instead to shoot for the lowest common denominator. To slow it down to a snails pace, deny my experience, intelligence, and energy. Hes not a good communicator. He belittled me with petty pop-psychology. Saying Im playing mommy by sticking up for my friends who he bowled over with his anger. Explained me to another class as acting out, a term reserved for fussy four year-olds. Telling me Im creating all this contention out of a need to I dont know. It didnt matter, did it? You all should have seen him waving his hands around as he shouted. People were spectating, watching the drama unfold in the Starbucks patio. The funny thing is this: we agreed that we agree, were shooting for the same objectives. Just its not ok for me to steer things. I really like so much about him. Hes a great mind, however extreme in his views. And so damn cute. But hes hostile, got a chip on his shoulder, and he and I are too much alike to back off. I confronted him without bowing down to his supposed power position. Maybe he thinks my age makes me less in a position to take him on like that; that I must be acting childish if Im challenging him. So Im backing off. He can have his way. Ill learn more on my own anyway. Without the shame of being told that i have too much to say about the material. This new diagnosis of mental illness that I'm dealing with pairing that with being reprimanded for acting intense not a good thing for me. I feel terrible tonight. Ive lost something good. Something that was really helping me feel better about myself. And it ends up being a source of more pain. More loss upon loss that erodes my spirit like a rusted-out chevy. Think of it; shaming me for being a passionate student. What do I do about that? Nothing apparently. Im done. Its not a middle finger to him. Its a self preservation measure for me. Its more of a sacrifice Im willing to make, being told to take the backseat when I'm clearly the best driver in the class. I cant handle feeling this bad for something I loved. Time to open another bottle of Zin.

 Ok, I give up. Im craving the act of smoking of something. This at the 3-week mark of quitting smoking. The half-dozen beers behind me catapults me into cravings beyond reasonable limits. As usual (as if my quitting smoking experience can now be spoken about with a word such as usual), Ive used getting stoned as a behavioural replacement to the inhalation of nicotine. When I hadnt since I left for italy in the everyday-capacity I used to have, a seven year habit. It helps. And shit, its a lot less fattening than the booze I consume. Youre thinking: what? With the things I eat when it gives me the munchies?! But me! I dont get them! Something with my mental chemistry makes it affect me totally differently. I got stoned before the Carlsbad Half-Mar and got my 13.1 done in 2 hours almost exactly. I was so high when I got there, I had a hard time putting the chip on my shoe. And you should have seen me passing people in the last three miles. I trained on chronic. I never get the munchies. If anything, dope just makes me eat when I forget. But nothing like Oreos or anything nasty like that. I have an image in my mind of the body that Im fully committed to returning to. I may have been an emotional mess, only able to cope by running 50mi/week. But I looked too fuckable to forget about. I had almost-sex with Luis that night. Too drunk to be present, yet present enough to cry my eyes out. I was too young. Too traumatized still from the rape to have him as the fuck buddy he eventually became. I remeber that night. I cried and drove home, all liquored up and hurting. Glad we could come together later. He's a good boy. So glad he's with someone so perfect for him. However, I feel the need to mention again... / I / asked her out first. Fucking gender restrictions.

 Oh, and I meant to mention this. A key element to my freedom this evening. I got a hold of my attorney today to inquire about getting an advance on the $16,000 settlement owed to me from my spine accident. Im in deep shit with two of my three credit cards; the damage of both coming to about $3000 plus what I owe my brother (400), and what I owe my parents (1g at least). I wanted to know if I could swing an advance, enough to keep the creditors from calling me (They keep calling me! plays on a Joy Division song as I write this). So you know what he said? Send me your bills. Ill submit them to the judge and have them pay them off. What?!?! You mean I can sleep at night without the aide of various poisons? Yes, yes the insurance company already owes me $4,000 for school expenses that they havent addressed. That check comes this week too. So Im ok after all. I ran my cards up with the assumption that Id have a bank statement of several (!) thousand to pay them off once this whole thing was worked out. But it turned out to be this slow pilfering of a sum, 200 a week. When I cant work!! Also, Im now going to get both the 800/mo for VocRehab and- 800/month of settlement instalments. FINALLY!!** Anyway my financial nightmare is assuaged. My credit may be ruined, but I can turn my phone back on. So /can/ I go to Ireland this spring break? Is Africa this summer on for sure now?!

 i wrote this for my livejounal site... i may as well post it here. my little alternate universe. i'm overwhelmed with love tonight. non-specific yet all-encompassing. ____ Luscious evening. What a joy to be so incredibly affected by environmental stimuli. The soft stirring in the trees. My runners high acting like post-coital glowing, eminating from every inch of me. A perfect night. I found myself unconsciously fingering a buttonhole on my shirt with erotic intent while sitting in on Haytons Shakespearian sonnet marathon reading. These delicate voices carefully yet passionately breathing a little bit of life into his lines of love and loss, jealousy and longing. And me, constantly running my hands through my freshly washed hair, unable to resist the pleasure of touching it. Its hard to be around Heather when Im feeling so fabulous. I want to share it, give freely my moments of bliss through tactile expressions. My fingers are just hungry. Touching the weave of a fabric, now running my fingers over the keyboard. Yet with her, I remember my place and happily accept my moods infectiousness as a satisfactory offering. Earlier I met up with a woman who Im grouped with to present a critical article on Mrs. Dalloway next week in Dawns 504 class. What began as an academic spelunking expedition turned quickly into an hour of personal exposition. I spoke of my heavy heart about my Queer Theory experience. She touched me with sweet support of my plight as a lesbian child of unaccepting and disrespectful conservative parents. Then she shared her marital uncertainty, her ambivalence toward maintaining the commitment. I wanted to touch her hand. Not sexually, but to soothe her. I did nothing more than observe my impulse. Again, I sat back serenely, knowing my compassion was being communicated with the power I intended it; without breaking taboo and taking her hand as she spoke. Why is it wrong to offer that comfort? Because the intensity in which I express it is too much to interpret? Why is there so much shame in loving someone who isn't your lover? I feel more when Ive been running. I feel more grounded bliss since beginning this medication. I dont have to experience joy and act impulsively to bring it to extremes. I feel playful and freed from all the existential despair that haunts from the dark corners of my minds interior. I played with Heathers children during the breaks, and it felt so natural and gratifying to engage them on the same plane of unburdened fun. I love those two little people. Reading sonnets with confidence in a room full of adults. I wish I was invited to babysit them. My body feels electrified. Too bad Kerris long gone. No one to share it within appropriate bounds. I can only imagine how fantastic Then again, its precious to keep it all to myself. Indulge in the private pleasure of release from the emotional exhaustion I worked myself into over trivial matters. This week was a bit more stressful than weeks past. Last night I dreamt of Claudia the nightmare of my heart. Therapeutic intimacy gone horribly wrong. I dreamt I found her while on vacation. The two of us together, finally, away from her husband, searching for an appropriately amazing place to lay together. To make love without worry. The both of us unbound by guilt or doubt. It was an amazing dream. Almost to the point where I want to contact her. I know where she lives, of course. I know her daily routine, revolving around her three kids and her workouts at Frogs in Encinitas. I had her license plate memorised ever since I met her in rehab. i miss her... Listening to my So Sad CD full of Nick Drake and very, very early New Order. And Kate Bush. I made this CD for my last therapist, Natalie. The last one who would take me on. After more than half a dozen heard my history and replied weakly, I cant help you. I dont even know where to start. Translation: youre too far gone to be helped. And I dont want the liability of having you as a patient. How that hit me She was adorable. Natalie. The obligatory crush was actually not a factor in our working together. yet she dumped me when I lost my parents financial support to pay for it. no sliding scale. After all the dismissals, I got one more. So I stopped looking. I think Ive had enough. I want to go for a drive. Dress warmly and put a skull cap on or something so I can have the windows down as I go, the freshness of the night air streaming into my lungs. Or just lay down on my plushy white bed and breathe in some music, rub the palms of my hands over the duvets embroidering. Youd think I popped a hit of E. maybe Ive just learned how to feel from my distant days of chemical coping. Lovely nonetheless.

 i may drink like barney, but at least i haven't done this since high school... oh, what a fabulous picture. Anyone for a CSI: Investigestion ? i just have to post this:

 Emotional day all in all. A near-tear moment in the advising office finding out I have a one unit requirement not yet met that potentially would keep me from graduating. Some begging on my part is on the docket for tomorrow morning with my science prof I need into another class of his, 102 instead of 103. good thing I went in to double check all this stuff. To relieve my suffering, I splurged on a sushi lunch with the lit girls and morgens man. Came home with a sleepy head and laid down in bed for a nap. Then thought twice; I took a long nap yesterday. Should I make a habit of this? Instead I played with the rabbit and threw on my running garb. I hit the streets, tacking on another two miles of gentle hills to my newly rediscovered running mission. I came home with a mouth full of sand I couldnt go much further without a sippy. Grabbed the soccer ball and spent some time concentrating while tired (jugglings harder when youre tired). You know Im upset with Aneil and that fucking class. Can I call it fucktarded? Well it is. Aneil tells me not to contribute so much to the online discussions. SO what did I do today? I responded to every posting up there. Why not tell me not to come to class? He says this LTWR336 class is not a literature class. ha- so, I emailed the department head and sneakily asked her what the queer theory class is classified as. I just want to hear it from the authority even though I know the answer. You know, Gabe is right; some people make arguments only to undermine the foundation others stand on. (I hope Im paraphrasing you correctly) why rallin would try to change the class category is beyond me. And what really bugs is his suggestion that Im not being receptive of others opinions and perspectives. When he played angry princess in our last class, shutting people up left and right. Not to be pop-psych about it, but its classic projection. Were alike; thats why were a burr in each others panties. I dont back down when someones trying to overpower me, put me down, or intimidate me. Like silly little Justin on Friday night. I was almost aggressively engaged with him, dominating him with comments not outright rude but bold nonetheless. In the spirit of my father, If they dont like me, they can kiss my ass. I love him sometimes. (except when its me whos on the receiving end of it) Now what? Bryan pussed out on getting together. And I cut my run short to join up with him. He ate and got lazy. Go figure thats what happened to me. I know what Ill do! Ill go buy beer and sit here concocting more things to say in response to the WebCT posts. Like I said at the close of one of mine today: and no, i'm not going to stop responding to these posts. you've sparked a compulsion with a mentally ill fanatic. deal :)

 baby shower hell. note to self: avoid these in the future. anyone want to play the dirty diaper game?

 i saw two cute things today that made my day. I?ll keep one to myself (so I don?t have to explain why I think she?s sexy). ... i wasn't expecting to find this woman so... against all convention, i was so unconventionally thinking about the woman's situation. something about her mouth, her jaw, the ways she spoke. i had a hard time keeping my eyes on hers. must be a result of my new specs. We pulled in to the Home Depot parking lot, me and Mom, amd I spotted my baby. Well no, just someone who reminded me of her. A man was out walking his pooch; I couldn?t stop looking and just walk passed into the store. A year-old Viszla was being walked by a nice guy in his early 30s. I realised it would be more polite if I went ahead and filled in the blanks to the questions in his mind. Me: ?Lovely dog. We have one of those.? Guy: ?Oh, really?? He came right up to me. His little one was such a show quality example of the breed. I couldn?t take my hands off the thing. Then he asks, ?So, I don?t know anyone else who has one of these dogs. What are they like when they?re older?? Mom and I exchange glances; I search her face for how to respond. Mom: ?They?re pretty crazy. Ours chases squirrels and rabbits and eats them. They?re fast; she can catch them.? Me: ?And give them a good thrashing to break their necks.? Yeah? my dowg. It was some kind of worthy substitution for seeing my own love-muffin at mom?s house. I couldn?t stop thinking about the run-in. And rethinking my designs to get a new cat. Why /not/ a dog?

 and then there's always the possiblility for me to adopt another evil cat-man. i liked this image, the photo attached to it's life's very last plea for survival. almost out of spite towards the order of nature and its selection processes. most rational beings would promise to adopt and drown it. and the one haunting my stairwell. i think the addition of a boxer or rotweiler will prove quite exciting. ha! a warm body for me bed, mate! all are spayed females too... 600 for a Vizlas pup... how would you think the bank would respond to the request to take out a loan for the purchase of a dawg? i want a baby living in here. a dog of any age = a baby in my house. if mom won't let me take "my dog" with me, i'm gonna have to get something. someone.

 is that a "mix" or what? so i'm rethinking my pet venture. look at these two babies!! i'm going on Sunday to pick one up... if Roxystar, Hazel, or Tofu is still there at the south shelter. Here's the number one pick: 1 - Roxystar. a spayed female BOXER who's 4 years-old. 2 - Hazel. a spayed female Rotweiler who's 5 years-old. 3 - Tofu. a spayed female Sharpei who's 3 years-ld. Or the mixed dog. or #5, this boy, Cleo:

 Im so my fathers child. Today, my mom and I went out to Home Depot for pony packs of pansies, a few bags of large chunk cedar bark, and to look at some bistro tables for the charming little corner spot in the yard. Success on all accounts but the table set-up, something that can happen anytime. So all this stuff had to be planted and worked. Oh, and mom brought over the four rose bushes Id picked out at the specialty nursery a few weeks ago. So we went to work. Each of us planted two rose bushes, a job that requires a hole of at least a foot deep for each. And in case you forgot, this condo is built beside a granite rock quarry. Anyone out there want to guess at what they do to fill in the lots to make them flat and uniform before building? Ah, yes. The largest rock I hit was the size of my head. No where will your shovel go down easily past an inch. CLINK. Oh, my back and joints. Multiply that by 24 small holes for the fleurs. And another purple vine plant that I had my eye on. I dug and I dug, fatal blows to the cement foundation/dirt backyard until it gave way enough to get my beauts in the ground. With every other strike, I let out laboured grunts, one out of five articulated enough to be distinguished as foul language. Alas, it was too dark to take decent pics of the work. So I opted instead for some general-area pics. Im physically trashed, but it was worth getting the job done in one session. Why stop until youre finished? What satisfaction is there in seeing a half-completed job? Ill never understand people not like me and Dad.

 I rule, part two. Just wrapped up the Health Fair held in the Field House on campus. A good time was had by all, due in no small part to the dozen massage therapists on hand (haha, get it?) to rub us down. And well, it was a kick in the pants for me to flag down dumb frat boys with free condoms. And take some lube. Chicks love it Really? Tight While others walked by without making eye contact, afraid their sexuality may be mistaken by someone if they take condoms from three homos. So that caps off my week of performance. Well, no. Im representing my school at the conference at UCSD this weekend too, so my time being on is not quite over. At least I dont have Rallins class to break my heart any more. My whole lgbt group is pissed at him, by the way. No one can believe how childish he behaved. I reckon Im better off without it. Im doing enough positive gay things right now to where that explosion of defeat isnt ruining my sense of self. I mentioned that Rallin talked about me in another class of his; the subject being centered on what to do with in-class difficulties as a teacher. I have two friends in it, so I got the low-down on what he said. Matt was shocked to hear this morning that it was me he was struggling to know what to do about. He asked the class, totally unsure. And then he failed so miserably in trying to deal with things properly? !! Matt: Oh! It was you!! So thats why he reacted the way he did when I told him I have a friend in his queer film class! Hes like, Oh yeah, who? and I said, Charlotte! And he just looked at me without a reaction and turned around until his back was to me all slow and dramatically without saying anything. I told Matt he should raise his hand in class and ask, So, howd it go with that student in your 336 class? How'd you handle it? As if he didnt just sacrifice a letter grade my admitting he knows me. Thatd way piss him off. "She dropped the class because you yelled at her, didn't she?" All weekend after the screaming at Starbucks with Aneil, I had sexual assault nightmares. Being gang raped by guys who were burying dead women in their backyard. Then being grabbed by some yuppy suburbanite Dad who got a finger in under my skirt from behind me (who my dad ceremoniously punched in the mouth when I ran to him for help). Its funny; I keep thinking of my dad and how cool it would be if I could even tell him what happened to me with Aneil. Hed be cleaning his gun in his mind; a real validation opportunity to get angry with the master. I know hed be as pissed as me, and we could yell together. A real family moment. Except Dad would say its cause hes a fag and all a result of your liberal education. I cant believe I didnt smoke through all of this week. Bravo, little one. Time to shop or something. An excuse to get out in the rain. Since Bryans plans with me fell through in favour of spending time with another one of his young female chums. Kind of irked, but its not worth worrying about.

 I rule. Its over, and apparently no one but me noticed how incredibly terrorized I was by the presentation I gave. Ive been nervous in front of a crowd before, but never have I had this reaction. Lets take a look I started out well. Casual enough, not just reading but making eye contact and adlibbing. Then came the meat of the presentation. Of course, I cant actually think while I read aloud, so I have no idea if I spoke English or what. The audiences faces let me know they were following, interested even. Then the sweat started. A warm night in a stuffy room didnt help matters. Nor did the thick wool black- sweater I was wearing. I wiped my brow. So the thing was winding down to a close, and with the end of the second page I turned to the last. But I shuffled the first page to the middle of the stack, so when I turned I saw *another* full page in front of me. GULP- that wasnt the look of the final page the last time I looked. I hesitated and figured it out in time for it to go unnoticed, but I laugh about it now. Like a recurrent nightmare that Im soon to have. The Presentation that Never Ends!! (cue sound: screaming dame lifted from any B-horror movie) (is it redundant to say horror movie and B-movie together?) So Im starting to think to myself, What if I stopped the presentation right now? Skipped a paragraph or two? I did that once in Moukhlis class The sweating is now well underway. The faintness starts setting in; faint like the last time I gave blood and went into a mini state of shock. And the nausea. Oh yes the vision becomes tinged with green in anticipation of the contents of my stomach about to appear on the notes in front of me. this is the part of the presentation where I grasped the podium for support, both physically and to center my mind on something real. That was it. people asked questions, we let Chris answer for us (Anne and I are more afraid of actually speaking we were both spent by the end of our 15 minutes). So it told us we did good. I know we did. Dawn acknowledged how much time we spent working on this, having seen us stay after last week together as well as overhearing our groups conversation about our last meeting together that lasted all day yesterday. Its over and we did good. And most importantly, I stepped up to the plate in a graduate class and didnt shit my pants. I didnt have an anxiety attack (before the actual act), and I didnt loose any sleep. Bravo. Oh, and I thought critically and produced valuable insights. Now, I shall smoke a bowl and wet my whistle with vodka. As if I need a method to relax.

 Killer film, man ok, hahaha. Serial killing isnt the soft spot in my film tastes. But throw a little lesbianism in there, and watch me hustle to the theatre! Even it was an experience of near torture to see such a hot mama ugly herself up to achieve true trash status. Lets take a comparative sample: Before.? And After! Dewd, take a shower. Whoo would you rather go down on? I think dental dams were invented for those ahem- represented so artistically in the film. Smokin dope tonight, tossing my feet up in satisfaction for a hard day done. i mean, for my little life. several hours spent with actual people going over our presentation tomorrow. me, having done my part in an hour that morning. (yet thinking about it for a couple of weeks) then to dinner at the most horrible place on earth, Souplantation. what a trooper; i was sweating bullets through that adventure. ever want to do the world a favor with mass violence (and come now, we all fantasize), open fire in one of these places. truthfully, i think Al Queda is planning systematic bombings of these and all the Home Town Buffets. then a whole movie! "Monster" was great. there was alcohol involved to make it easier for me, sure. but still i'm thrilled that i did so much today. people are nutz. if you doubt it, watching that movie might remind you.

 Worst restaurant ever? Well, thatd be a toss up between Home Town Buffet and Souplantation. So where did the lgbt group decided to go tonight before the movie? The S-word. Should I go? Do I dare? I should note that Ive also been invited to attend a dinner at Rockin Baja Lobster. Never been there, but it gots to be better than cafeteria-style slop reminiscent of my imagined time in the service. Theyre on their way there (wow! All forms of there in one concise sentence!), so Id better go. Im a bit ravenous after spending a four hour study and prep session with the 504 ladies. The big presentation is tomorrow. Heres my part to be taught to the class: Septimus Smith Septimus is branded by his doctors as being mad. Yet Froula raises the question is he? In this article, she explores that question as well as the issue of his character within the framework of the novel as a post-war elegy. To the issue of madness, she sites Foucault. His theory is that civilisation disciplines madness to suppress its truths while art recaptures truths branded madness to confront the world with the necessity of change (Froula 15). So, Septimuss character forces us to reexamine what is truth and what is madness in a spiritually bankrupt post-war Europe. She describes Septimus as being a scapegoat to the new reality of Europe and for the immense weight of loss hanging over civilisation. He has witnessed first-hand the aggression inherent in humanity and its threat against the future of the world. He is tortured by the images he carries with him in his mind and besieged by guilt for having survived but left unable to feel. His reality is shattered replaced by the notion that the world is without meaning. Like Clarissa, he questions the existence of God in a world so fraught with violent aggression and despair. I agree with Froulas analysis; that Septimus is at once a sort of prophet who claims to see a new truth that reorders religious ideologies. And at the same time, not many would question whether hes a madman (whatever judgment we want to put on that). The novel casts new light on post-war reality and causes us to rethink the fundamental underpinnings our civilisation is predicated on. How could this war have happened? Whats left? And more importantly, how do we move on from here? Froula calls him an elegiac consciousness (Froula 16). His mind struggles to carry the grief and move on from it by framing his experience in a message to the world. The message he brings back with him also contains truths about the murderous aggression of war and its threat to civilisations endurance. Yet society is constructed so as not to hear this. His physicians embody the cultures refusal to examine the larger questions brought out by the war. Like many Britons, theyve turned the madness of the war onto the soldiers, making it their pathology thats the problem that needs to be dealt with. I hadnt thought about this before reading the article, and I think its a great point she makes. Rather than to bear the burden placed on him by the doctors, he fights to communicate his message through prophetic speech and finally by his suicide. Although he tries to convey his thoughts, his efforts are ultimately a failure. Instead, he re-enacts his civilisations appalling crime by turning the violence on himself. He offers his life as a gift to the world that, according to Froula, he fully expects to be read. He is posing as a Christ figure, sacrificing his own life for the sake of others. In Septimus mind, The whole world was clamouring: Kill yourself, kill yourself, for our sakes (MD 92). Froula describes his death as the moment when two realities converge; that of the suicide society demands and, as Clarissa somehow divines, an attempt to communicate (MD184). He is pushed, yet he also jumps (Froula 19). His suicide is seen as pathology by the doctors, yet Clarissa reads it as Septimus intends. His action passes the message on to her. It sparks in her a spontaneous private elegy for him. She muses that he preserved something by saying no to the Conversion imposed on him by the doctors who branded him insane; The Conversion to Christianity as salvation and to the insistence that he has lost his mind. To her, he preserved something that matters, untouched by the hands of a society that wished to confine him. This elegy created within Clarissa leads her to reflect on her own blighted truth; Sallys kiss. His suicide acts as a substitution for her own losses, a cathartic mourning, allowing her to safely revisit the compromises she too has made in bowing to societys constraints and failures. The author goes on to say that the point of the elegy is not so much for Clarissa to fully grasp the meaning of Septimus death but for us, the readers, to reconsider the state of a post-war civilisation. We are left to wonder; Is it enough? (Maybe only makes sense to those who have #1: read the critical article (30 pages!) were responding to, and #2: have read Mrs. Dalloway. Bye yall.

 Nothing like a new toy to brighten my day. I didnt pay for it; no, I didnt steal it either. It has been a year since my phone contract went into effect, so I went out to update it. Oh, what fun! I spent a good 30min playing with the stupid thing, changing the ring tones, transferring my phone book, choosing a background and screensaver. Its so cute and compact; yet not so small that its not user friendly. actual size: Im IMing my best girl, Amy. Shes in Barbados, totally cut off from her contacts here. Most importantly these days, its her boyfriend whos too far away. Im trying to counsel her, give her some things to think about along with my (maybe empty) opinions. How shes been able to juggle a long-distance relationship for like 8 months is amazing. She works all the time. And shes not coming home until the end of June. I wish for her to put a pause on her relationship with Kyle to wait until distance is no longer an issue before making any sweeping decisions about it. hes clearly having a hard time too. So why not aim to resume when she returns to the States? Then she can date Fabien. That big hunk of a man with the dreads and dark chocolate skin. Mmmm I got some homework done today, but most of my energy went to errand running and the washing of my car. And the calling to Kris. I need a bag, man. This no smoking gig is trying. Even at the three week mark. Wheres the dope, mayn?

 Adoption possibility. I have a date to meet someone found through a classified ad. Hes giving his cats away free to a good home. And man oh man, am I praying that my home gets them. An Abyssinian and an Egyptian Mau, both male and declawed. Considering the kinds of cats they are, I think the declawing is justified (if not marginally sadistic). So Im not sure how I could be happier. Yet, being the good cynic that I am, Im withholding my excitement until I know for sure how fortunate I am. They could be feral beasts. Or mere tabbies that the guy is trying to bullshit me into believing (like anyone couldnt tell the diff). Ive wanted an Aby since I was a preteen. The Mau Id never heard of it until tonight. Best part? The guy is definitely family, and I think our mutual positions on that will benefit me.

 one more thing... is there anything more beautiful than those? thanks to Vintage_Sex for that.

 Ok, this is /so/ my link of the day. Don't ask how I stumbled across urlLink this site .

 hehe...

 Hooray Rosie and Kelli! Congratulations! Strange that the same day this marriage happens, the Howard Stern show gets thrown off the air. My parents like to call it the culture war. Well, here it is. Oh, and my IDEAL JOB? Since someone asked me... it's to embody a varient of Carrie Bradshaw from Sex and the City . But I'd have to be less of an introvert, now wouldn't I?

 Lovely, lovely storm. Dressed to the nines in my best homeless garb, eager to step out and trudge through it. See? The weather is /propelling/ me out the door to school. Troubling symptom of stress: woke up /twice/ crunching down on teeth, chipping one. Went back to sleep with the corner of a pillow in my mouth. What else to pacify me? I could really regress and pop a thumb in there; if I wasnt concerned about losing a much needed appendage. Maybe Ill skip class and go for a walk. Tape up my ankle and ugh. No. Cold and wet doesnt align comfortably with swelling and arthritic joints. Jesus Christ, Im too old to be 25. I wish I was in Julian to watch it come down. A walk through the mud with no sound but the falling water. Throw on some shitty old runners and tromp through puddles with a joyful mudhound by my side. Bryan calls this a function of depression: the tendency to want to sit and watch the rain, to see the entire storm realising how few and far between these come to us. To get as much of it as I can knowing its soon to disappear. Like he is with food; like I am with my impulses (to write). To immerse myself in the experience before its gone. Depression or hedonism, whos to say? Im getting sucked into this entry school attendance is seeming more and more unlikely as the minutes tick by. Jim Brady is on the telly speaking about, what else?, gun control. A mental wrestling match underway in my little head, tossing around the controversy surrounding our second amendment to the Bill of Rights. Unless youve experienced an FBI raid of your home, I dont think people can fully grasp the fundamental importance for citizens to be permitted to bear arms. To protect ourselves from the overreaching arm of a government with abusive implementations of its power. Its pure ignorance to assume the government will forever adhere to its promise to serve the people and obey the limitations written into our laws. Me? I want to be able to defend myself. Not that I want a gun; I want the right to own one. Further, isnt it interesting that our culture would rather pin responsibility of gun violence to the guns themselves? What about the deeper underlying crisis of anger and hostility that set the stage for the violence to occur? I suppose its much simpler to focus on the tools of violence. Same thing with the /so failed/ war on drugs. Its like putting a band-aid on a tumor. To school then to the beach to see the surf.

 when i kill myself, it's going to be in front of a recursive loop of bad reality TV. (a redundency, of course) what planet is this, and who exactly live among us? i'll give 1000 to anyone out there who can honestly say they've read DF Wallace's _Infinite Jest_ and get that reference. Shit, i could just disappear for two months and reread that one. for the third time... i want so much to get a signed copy of it. or at least my first two copies with all the annotations - both lent out to friends, never to be seen again. Septimus banked his suicide on the prayer that someone would read his statement - when he couldn't formulate his message otherwise. like VW, a longing to call out for help but without having to do it directly. ---all thoughts derailed ---- it's that Seinfeld_ episode when they get the pool table.

 are you sure you dykes and fags really support the idea of getting married? urlLink Marriage Penalty i know, i'm not an idiot. another tax restriction will be enacted to punish all equally under the law. still, can't we all sit back smugly for just a second tonight? (insert the sound effects of the FBI taping my line. only, i only know what that sounds like from the days in the 80s when they tapped our phones - what dorks! it was so obvious when they started recording. and mom let them know, of course.)

 Oh, the requisite cynicism of a London prostitute! One day I'll hire her. What a great blog site! urlLink Belle de Jour About her job: I was looking forward to getting out in a large group. Work can be intense. It's like having a series of blind dates over and over again, struggling to keep your end of the arrangement effortless and light, all whilst knowing very little is going to come of it. Draining. And while I enjoy hanging in cafes and coffee bars with a small group of friends, there is always the danger that by knowing too much about each other, all useful conversational skills will be lost. Only with people who've known you since puberty can you be entertained by "Remember the..." (vague hand gesture) "Yes, just like in the movie." "Oh god! And the arm thing B used to do!" (random Star Wars quote) (reference to mid 90s politics) (satisfied silence, or fits of inexplicable giggles for half an hour) __ I adore this woman. I'd spend plenty to experience it with her; and make a fabulous appearance in her website. If you're a perv like me, I want to hear it: (frickin' vanilla friends! do something outrageous once in a while! or at least entertain the want!) What would her website look like if you were last night's client? Shit, I think I may have to consider one day making a scholarship available to the best essay addressing that prompt. thinking back to the sublime comedy routine performed by Maria Bamford.... (paraphrasing) "I've never had sex for money... Ok, a basket of curly fries and a Bud, but not actual cash!" So much lost on the delivery. footnote: See Comedy Central for more...

 I just got caught up with rereading my posts from the last week. Like watching a ball of twine unrolling, I like being able to trace the downward spiral of an inadequately managed mental illness. Ok, so much of this stuff cant be blamed entirely on genetics; life is what it is. But what a resource to be documenting this stuff. Besides the fact that I have to. Id cry if I couldnt write. Ive even taken to recording things on bar napkins to relieve the word-lust. I have to. In my best testimonial voice: Its more than a hobby! Its an obsession! (Big toothy smile like the Every-American Dope!) Except today Im absorbed equally into reading this stuff. The Italy Travelogue the book I havent written yet. And the London Travelogue a work in progress. I so need to return. I keep dreaming of grey streets and dark bars (yes, theyre pubs, but the internal rhyme sounded better to me). of being a stranger in a city with an incomprehensibly complex history poured into the moulds of endless stretches of looming buildings. Feeling at once incredibly diminutive beside the towering monuments to capitalism and infused with the vibration of life with a pace so much faster than I could keep up with. I just want to observe. To don my coat and walk. Breathe, watch, and walk like a native; with a sense of direction. Of a schedule. A shallow metaphor for a longing for something more universally meaningful (like having a clue about my own direction), but doesnt it sound like a nice exercise to jump start my writing, my world, my faltering momentum. Maybe Im too influenced by all the Virginia Woolf Im reading for Dawns grad class. All the identification (same mental illness, same paranoia, same thwarted lusts) seems to wear away at my ability to separate myself from her. Just when I think remaining a hermit in my house will protect me from influence, Im taken by a literary figure. Things get in my head that I cant filter out. People. Moods. Images I wish not to recount in fear that theyll come back. Its such a Radiohead and Kate Bush kind of day. Nothing like having your feelings validated. Something strange happened to me while I was talking to someone the other day. a total stranger, yet I felt moved to express something. Like I know her, but I dont. I could say more, but I don't think I know how to approach it. Strange what happens when I leave the computer. Whats that about? Projection City? (Ok, each of you have just earned license to flog me for using a pop-psych term. Punishment Ill take with a fabulous contraction and a smile) I just want it to rain. Makes the world the way I see it; everyone else is suddenly covering their heads from the onslaught (no, too violent a word) from the environmental darkness. Theres a wonderful intimacy of it all. Creates a sense of being at home that sunny days dont afford me. not these days anyway. Not until I can lay naked in the grass in a sweltering heat wave. Mmmm... Storms give me an excuse to be reclusive and reflective. To look at it for hours, the sheets of water. To see the worlds passion without leaving my windowsill. Nothing like a good sweat. Even for the earth.

 Wakin up this morning feeling pretty damned pathetic. Observe the scene: Ok, so its half past noon when I finally decide to rouse myself from my sweaty slumber. Not because Im motivated to get up; I just happened to look outside out of one eye and saw my dad in the yard putting in a sprinkler system. Its a bad-daughter thing to go on sleeping, even I am helpless (and uninvited) to lend a hand. How could I see him out side with one eye whilst still lying down? I spent the night on the floor of the living room where the night before me and Bryan camped out on the air mattress to watch The Hours a second time. I passed out before the end. When he got up to leave, I didnt feel too strongly about hoisting myself up the stairs. And anyway, my ankle is a nightmare. No hoisting for a while, save for various beverage containers. Were in pain over here. In a whole new area of the bod. Which I suppose is another additive to the melange of mood depressors. Ive been rather gloomy about things since the Aneil breakup (yeah, I think its appropriate to refer to it that way). My momentum has shifted. I allowed enough self doubt and guilt into my head to derail my forward progress. And then came this failed conference where no one would go with me. and then the added strain of a problematic ankle keeping me from exercising. The needle scratches off the record. I blame Aneil. Its more fun to place blame than to pin it on random circumstance. The happiest Ive been in the last couple of days? Last night while I was asleep. You betcha. Why do you think I spend so much time in bed? I had a fabulous dream, the plot of which wasnt nearly as wonderful as the overall sensation of being at peace. Safe and secure. A hotel in London. Five of my most loved girlfriends and me, engaging in some lovely consequence-free sexual expression, all of us together without a serious care in the world. And a shower scene of all things! Man, Ive been watching too many bad movies. Who was the lucky mate in there with me? Cyndi Lauper. Yep, who knows where that came in. I even joked in my dream that shes finally in my ideal age group. What is she now? 50? Yep. Although I would have guessed 40 before I just looked it up (what /is/ my cut-off age these days? It used to be 40, but) We walked through London streets holding hands and catching the tube to different locales. Freudian penetration fantasy, yes. I see that. We were smitten and drinking each other in. And when I woke up again, my heart sank. Fantasy gone. Empty reality replacing it. Ive nothing that resembles that safety and connectedness. Nada. I thought of cutting myself, and I hadnt even gotten up to pee yet. I already woke myself up from another dream by screaming in my sleep. At my mom for berating my sexuality. Hostile? Yep. She told the whole neighbourhood of my sins; everyone was treating me like a serial child rapist. I was yelling at her, condemning her to hell for hurting me. and while I was screaming, I had a moment or two when I knew I was dreaming, but I kept on yelling. Like I had this opportunity to say something that would slip away if I didnt engage it immediately, let it happen. Made some kind of subconscious deal with myself to allow the angry catharsis to take place. Yeah, Ive got some things going on. Bryan admitting again that he wants to kill himself last night. It hurts because I know what he means. Its such a struggle to stay alive. When life lacks that necessary daily confirmation that anything is worth doing. I mean, I can remind myself of things. But it shouldnt take so much effort. You know?

 Man, it looks better in this place. My goal was to sterilise the kitch this morning, but my ankle is threatening mutiny. Various colours of paint getting the scrub treatment in this mornings shower prove that last night was another type-A success story. But alas, my activity allotment has been used up. Its all about ice and elevation for my right hoof. Little Anna-man gets her vet check today to see if her nether region needs surgery. A condition to adoption Im not in a position to take on. But she sure is cute if shes still there next week, Ill think about it again. Having a puppy with an ankle surgery wouldnt be good planning on my part. Piddles, whining at the door to be let out, scoopin poop, moping up stray food bits. Nah. An adult sounds better. Time to make some ortho/surgeon calls. I demand full wheelbarrows of greasy Chinese food to be brought to me every hour on the hour while Im on my back nursing my surgery wounds. Good day.

 Stupid speech by the dim one this morning. Some bits of thought: Marriage is the most fundamental institution of civilisation, is it? Bush is a dork. He doesnt even know the difference between sex and gender. Where does he live anyway? We're going to look back on this move by Bush as a pretty dark moment in our history. A constitutional ammendment to discriminate. How antithetical to our country. The welfare of children and the stability of society? This is what's on the table? Why not outlaw divorce?

 anyone out there know of a gifted orthopeaedic surgeon? someone who specializes in ankles? it's time for surgery. i've been lead to believe that life isn't supposed to hurt all the time. but can it be fixed? will scar tissue removal make it any better? i'll do it, whatever i'm offered. i need to run again. as it is now, the pounds feel like they're adding exponentionally each day. but i can't with this thing going on. transplant recipient here. [in my best sally struthers voice] "please. if you /can/ donate, won't you?"

 Back to Lowe's, the ghost town store that just opened across the street from a what? Yep, a Home Depot. We need that as much as a third Walmart within five miles. Just because Starbucks does it!!!?! A question to pose to all you ltwr students out there Who has the best handwriting? Moukhlis or Yuan? The shit looks like Arabic up there on the board. Salah goes through a box of chalk per class period when he hits the board with too much force and the thing splinters off in innumerable directions. And with the parallel communication difficulties of Yuans accent, its a good thing we have the students giving the lectures in that class. Oh, there are some things Im going to miss once I graduate. For example, how many times have I heard Salah say the following things: Uh-uh-uh, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera not that the etc. means anything specific. Today Id rather be in the backyard and the garage than at university. Rearranging the furniture and the art on the walls. Last night I got a hair up my ass and went to town retexturizing some plant pots my mum gave me. Inhaling dope and Rust-esque paint fumes. Very nice in the reddish bark if I do say so myself. I have paint on my forearms to prove my weekend wasnt slothful. The conference was crap. I mean, the first night was fabulous! I got to meet one of the lead councils on the Lawrence v Texas sodomy case. Im so thrilled with that man, I got his autograph after the incredibly moving speech he gave. People were crying, it was amazing. But after that, I had no one to go with. So I didnt go. My lgbt group completely dropped the ball, and I didnt feel like being the one representative anymore (besides Matt, our revered President). Not even he could go the big day of everything. So I went to one thing in the evening and that was it; opting instead to spend the day sleeping, watching the storm, and catching up on my _Sex in the City_ episodes (a much more valuable cultural connecting). What /did/ I see at the conference that night? D.R.E.D. The black woman drag king who did the best P Diddy impersonation. It was mildly funny. But from me, a lot of it was the conscious suspension of a critical mindset to enjoy it. Then came the end a whole slam style speech about loving ourselves. I thought I was going to be ill. So I looked around as surreptitiously as possible to gauge the responses of my fellow audience members. Eager smiles, yo. It was like being in the studio during a taping of the Oprah show. Now I want to hear you all scream! You know Im not letting you out of here until I hear each and everyone of you say it proud! (yes, a grammatical error I noted) D.R.E.D. : I L o v e M y s e l v e s ! everyone! : I LOVE MYSELFelves.. ?? D.R.E.D. : AGAIN! Everyone: I LOVE MYSELF! There was some question in the crowd whether they were supposed to say self with the singular or plural, resulting in a split decision. It /was/ a drag show. And truthfully, I was feeling a bit schizophrenic myself. No, the conference did nothing for my sense of self. If anything, it consecrated my lurking suspicion that queers are as dumb as the rest of the population; a conclusion I was fighting to acknowledge.

 The yard in better light:

 Like clockwork, the VAT has begun to hump my legs the moment I decide to do some bloggery. Fucking cat I thought a lot about him today about how hard it may or may not be to trade him in for a dog. All the dog shopping that happened today. I lost myself in it. each new baby Id meet and play with I had my heart broken. I can only take one. And the one I take must correspond to my current pet stipulations. Like, it needs to be described as: Will not swallow existing pet. Or maybe the more essential, Will not maul if looked at in the eyes. I want a dowg. I looked at four shelters today. The one by my house (Vato resource center) is closed on Sundays. So I went to the one by my old high school, the [Santa Fe] Humane Society. Thats where I met Anna. I rushed to see her in the interaction room as soon as I could. In case someone else had their eye on her. We played in the pen for about a minute until the thing got distracted with the toy I threw. Itll take some training, but shes a clean slate. Shes got a medical blip though; her vagina! Something about it being more inverted than out. Yeah, thats a prob! Can you repair that in humans? Ive seen the teeniest clitsTuesday after the vet determines whether she needs surgery to correct it, Ill know whether this cutie-pie (potentially monstrous) can be my love muffin. The word Jingo is in my head for some reason can I name a dog Jingo? I was coerced into driving all the way to the Escondido shelter by a senile old lady. Of course, Luke doesnt have any behavioural problems! The beautiful boy I saw on the website and thought Id call to inquire about rather than just drive out there blindly. I was duped. A violent pit bull. Whod eat your cat in a minute. No luck today just a hole in me heart for all the animals soon to be destroyed.

 Yesterday?s meeting with Susan triggered enough nervous energy to keep my cheeks aflame for hours after. Shaking hands upon arrival, somehow the gesture struck me as inappropriately intimate. I suppose because my hands were already shaking on their own, thank you very much. I was plenty afraid. Talking about my career future is like? well, it?s like going in for a prelim therapy appointment. All the tilling of the earth that?s required to get what?s going to fit me, the temperament analysis, the talk about what I feel is worth doing and what?s too frightening to even consider. I almost cried at one point. It?s difficult to forecast how my mental state and interpersonal quirks will affect my ability to work in certain situations. I mentioned my SMI to her, immediately afterward my eyes darted back and forth for cover. Guess it?s not over with, this adjustment period following the diagnosis. I think I was ashamed to admit it. I stopped short of providing any more detail than that. the period of loss (of my conceptions of myself) isn?t quite finished. My parting words were the most poignant. ?I don?t really feel safe in the world, so talking about all this stuff is really intimidating, really threatening.? Information I later shared with my mom. She knows. Even my dad knows. It?s a hold-over in part from the FBI raid. Dad got over it, mom still copes with it. Yet still, there?s Julian. What lies beyond the reach of the threats of the world. Maybe I?ll go up there this weekend.

 the text is lame, but the image is priceless. i'll have to remember it the next time i crave a smoke. and yes, i still crave em.

 i'm smitten with someone so unlikely that i'm embarrassed to admit who. it's a mad world. if even /i'm/ too reserved to explain it... but it's true. and it's mildly amusing. it'd be gratifying to explain this to Wally, our fellow 80 year-old lit student. who asserted his opinion last night than anyone who has slept with more than one person in their life, they're to be referred to as "primiscuous". i'm more than thrilled to create a sex life founded in high shock value to amuse the masses. another dream of breaking my back and legs (and having my teeth fall out) -- as a result of a soccer match this time. (no wonder i slept so long) the night before i dreamt i had caramel in my teeth, and i went at it with a finger. and my teeth disappeared like caramel. and if all goes well, i'll complete the cycle of paranoia dreams tonight with a vision of my hair falling out. it will in twenty years anyway. i lost my breath about two weeks ago when i was playing with my hair in class. i was twirling bits of it, and before i knew it i had five to six pieces of hair in my hand. i went back to check, the base of my scalp, right side (where my mom's hairloss began). and more came out. it kept coming. i still don't have a good explanation of it, what happened. i don't think i'm really loosing my hair this early on. possibly it's my own fault for wishing my right foot's ligaments have been magically replaced in the night. what does it mean when you keep dreaming about your teeth and hair falling out?

 This Halloween, Im making my own House of Horror. Heres a preview: -commercials. look, grandma! THIS butter is better! I want to tear my skin off at the sight and sound of it. this base appeal to our dim flock. -Reality TV (I dont know what can say more clearly than agreeing to a death sentence by a ball pein hammer and a broken shard of glass before Id sign up to watch this shit.) -mandatory slamming of meth to keep you up while you review the above again and again.) Im a sadist in mind but not in heart.

 well, if he's going to read me, should i speak to the entries that mention him? no, i should address once and for all the sentiment held by us all. I hereby renounce my right to post endless blather about cats or any feline-related subject. no pictures. no mention longer than a couple of lines. i promise. i just feel like a new parent, eager to show off what a perfectly formed poop my little one created in her diaper. and with that comparrison, i take a rest. i'll just sit here stoned and watch more syndicated Seinfeld episodes. the indulgence of one who's ahead in her classes. shit! i slept from midnight to 4:30pm today. can ya beat that?

 Quite funny. Maybe you all arent privy to this already, but I can see whos coming to my blogs. I know who you are and what youre looking at. And today Im seeing Rallin on my site. Shall I be flattered that the ebb and flow of my life is of interest to him? Or shall I assume a less noble motivation? Lets see what did he look at? Well, this page and the last two in the archives. Pour quoi? I thought this little hissy fit was over between us? The fur has settled, yes? I didnt pursue it with the administration. More because Im not up for the confrontation than because I want to protect him. So why? Ok, no. its not over if Matt continues to tell me that Rallins treating him differently since our friendship was made known to him. Whether thats happening or not, I cant say. But Christ, if it is true, grow up. Dude, Bill Bennet is an IDIOT! Every change weve made to the institution of marriage has weakened society. Really!? Ban divorce, right? Sounds like a brilliant idea for all those DV victims?! To hell with them! Learn to fight back, right?! And what about interracial marriage? An abomination! Why, just imagine! Oh, I dont know why I even turn this damned show on each night. Its the OReilly hour. Its a hold over from other days when I lived with mom and dad. Maybe I miss the yelling. Otherwise known as the only time I spoke to my dad. Maybe I should title this entry anger! Smokin dope keeps it at bay, dont it? And the daily dose of mind-numbing Simpsons episodes.

 More evidence to support my theory: No, I have no theory. Just that it takes all kinds to make the world go 'round.

 one more pic... like the finger?

 still hungry, are ya boy? yes, he's rather large. vato and the new ones were introduced today. vato's been a true gentleman. making his kitty sounds and cautiously introducing himself. we'll see how long it takes for them to actually get along. but so far, so good. i'll keep them separate when i go off to school, but i think they should get to know each other as long as i'm here to supervise.

 Man, I miss the Autobots. Are the Transformers on anymore? Perhaps I don't miss them as much as this guy...

 Its official. I got my stripes as a bonafide sterotype of a lesbian. I own three cats. Theyre hiding in the closet. An image reminiscent of that scene in ET where hes hiding out among the stuffed animals. Little glowing eyeballs reflecting light back at me. I snapped a couple of shots against their will. The Abyssinian has this odd meow that he keeps letting out. Theyre able to talk somewhat; more capacity to vary its sound. Then the Aby decided to come check out the view: Isn't he cool lookin? well, you surely can't tell from that photo. his black-tipped ears, his face like a puma, the strange 3 colored fur on his back and the black stripes. Vatos dealing with it ok. Hes batting the door, swatting his paw through the crack at the bottom hoping to hit something. Now outside, so I went to interact with him. He was lurking in the bushes until he heard a squirrel chirp. Ive never seen him run so fast, the look of sheer terror on his face. he's afraid of squirrels! Ill have to get an email ready to send to the previous owner. Poor guy. Then again, once he comes by to see my place hell feel a smidge better about it.

 from webmd.com... last line. Fracture A fracture is a broken bone. A break may occur when a bone is twisted, struck directly, or used to brace against a fall. Fractures may be closed (the broken bone does not break through the skin) or open (the skin is broken over the fracture site, and the bone may poke through the skin or be visible in the wound). A fracture may occur at the same time as other injuries, such as sprains, strains, or dislocations. It may be difficult to tell the difference between a severe sprain and a fracture.

 Jesus Christ, you guys. I know I have some problems, but doesn't this image take your mind off of anything you may be thinking. Like, so you can't think of anything else, and you're soon found shrieking out while waiting in line at the grocery store: "NOOOOO!!! Get OUT! Get OUT of my HEAD!! Stop looking at ME!!" betwixt his maligned nipples and the snakey belly roll, i'm left with a distilled sense of horror. god bless america.

 I hope you all realise this: I meant to take a break from blogging, from email, from sitting in front of the puter in general (since it was like 80% of my days for months) But finding out Ive a broken ankle? I cant possibly spend this much time on my butt without this outlet. Specially cause Im having my cable turned off. Too much money that I cant afford (and dont see as a priority). The thing hurts like a bitch, by the way. I was siphoning my wort into the fermentation carboy when my foot felt like a hot (and spicy!) knife went thru it. Oops I should be resting. Standing on one foot sterilizing tubing and fumbling with several gallons of volatile liquids (in their way I know, its not the right word for it). But yeah, I guess it feels like its broken. I guess I just shrugged it off like I was complaining too much. You know? Ive so much going on, it seems like its not possible to be really injured. I dont have time for something like that. Like having a bruise on my knee when my hand is on fire. Other things have taken priority! As f-ed as that seems, walking/working out on a broken bone. You know of course you have a couple of broken toes on your right foot too, the MD says to me. God. Still?! I ask, a bit less shocked than my responses tone suggested. Ive had my big toe irreparably broken for 17 years. And another for maybe ten. A cleat crushed it the same game that a girl kicked me so hard, my shinguard snapped in half and my leg shook on its own for about 15 seconds while I lay on the grass. Hit the patella tendon pretty hard; it can spaz out when that happens. North Huntington Beach did it at the Surf Tournament. We lost in the semis in a shoot outt. When I punched that girl in the face for tearing my jersey when I was trying to shoot. And their coach got a red card. No wonder me and Amy are so crippled. I dont ever do this, but this week Im giving it a try. Mom encouraged me to take the risk. (ahem) Im not going to worry a smidge about the blunders of late. Im even working towards pretending nothing ever happened. And shes right; what else can I do? So its behind me. who cares but one person?! And Ill never see her again! Btw, Mom doesnt know about the blood lust. Nor does she know of the new cat adoptions; shell mark it up as another example of my self-indulgence and tell me I should have only gotten one. I mean, I am self-indulgent. God bless her for being honest enough to tell me during a tearful conversation yesterday. but yeah I dont think its wise to get on myself for anything right at this time. Resolute discipline is beyond my capacity this weekend.

 Ive made a decision. In light of last nights horrors, Ive decided I need to take a break from the writing. A measure to keep me from acting like an empty stomach eating itself, the way I spend too much time in my head creating a madness that may or may not be in here. I may have fucked up pretty bad last night, but Im putting it behind me. trying to be nicer to myself, to stop thinking myself into the toilet So, I bid you all adieu for a spell. Apologies to those Ive scared by my behaviour. A special shot out to one person in particular. Its nothing personal.

 Speaking of Amy... in case you're not in my immediate milieu, this is my dear one as photographed on the island by me.

 So, what if I try to make this pipe dream of me and Amy come true? Id be perfectly in my element in charge of a restaurant in that environment, the slow pace of Barbados. Either make wonderful Italian food or blend it with a healthful vegetarian cuisine. Me and Amy would be a fantastic duo. And too, we both talked about having ourselves some brown babies. Id love to breed with a boy like Vincent. Have mixed children with Amy earn us all dual citizenship. All Ive really been primed for, job wise, is to become a mother. Skilled at cooking, cleaning, teaching, running around like a child So long as the Vincent I meet is into making an agreement. He can sleep with whomever he chooses, so long as he uses protection and gets tested all the time. and i'll get to have all the girlfriends i want. Its the 21st century. Its the era where we can define our own realities, yes? and shit, do you really think i'd give up women? "marriage" is a farcical institution. i'd join the minions only to spite the idea. Now would mom be happy if I bred my genes with a black man? If I did this way outside of her world, causing her reason to get on an airplane? What Id really like is to manage something with Amy. Make an arrangement with her. For us to have our children together, at the same time and in the same space. Be bound to each other for advice, support, and babysitting convenience. And to be a team, raising athletic super-children. Can you imagine how adorable my kids would be if I had them with Vincent?

 This is a continuation of the previous entry... but for livejourmal users, this is the story...: I was about 19 at the time. Been having shit loads of Claudia trouble. You remember; I was a mess of pain. So I go up to Julian to refuel my spirituality and reconnect to the world. Feeling awesome and driving home in my little red celica wearing my bathingsuit top and shorts. I was in heaven. Speeding down the 78 from the foothills with all the windows down, music blasting, intoxicated by the orange blossoms in the San Pascual Valley. I was alive. Refreshed and relieved to finally get a break. I pulled up to a light next to the North County Fair mall. On my way to Del Dios to take me home to Mom and Dads. My driver-side window was open. Hey, chica. (loud kissing sounds, some whistles) Where you going? I remained indifferent, pretending he wasnt talking to me. (more kissing sounds) Yo baby! Whats your name? Ok, so I /was/ 19 and pretty fucking hot at that point in time. But thats not the issue. I rolled up my window without reacting. I was still enraged with men, and I thought it best to try to make the interaction go away rather than replying to him. Then things started hitting my car. My closed window. Things bigger than a golf ball but not as heavy. I put the car in neutral and pulled the E-brake. Fury took hold of me. out of nowhere, this man was pounding his fist on my buttons. I opened the door and got out of my car, right there in a four lane road filled with cars, waiting for the light to change. Drivers and passengers watching me, I could see it in the corner of my eye. Nostrils flared, eyes ablaze with vengeance. The man, a just-under 30ish Mexican dude sitting shotgun next to a WOMAN. He frantically apologized, apparently noting the violence in my eyes. [btw this was when my rape still fucked with me. and I was lifting a lot of weights pretending to be stronger in my endless fight with the Claudia situation.] I was pissed. Just sublimating it as a good girl tries to do. What happened next? Me, standing over this man in the passenger seat of an 80s model Nissan? In front of God and everyone, standing angrily in an underwire black bikini top and foxy shorts, no shoes, looking my 19 year old best. I spit in his face. I was sucking on my tongue as it was, trying to defer the rage to something actively physical. Sucking, sucking on my tongue, my mouth pursed and protruding, gathering momentum and saliva. I spit in his face. Turned around, got back in my little celica. The light turned, and I went on my way. Coolly, confidently, as if nothing happened. I did see a woman driving a sadan waiting behind me, out at the limit of my peripheral vision. Her mouth was wide open in shock. Two blocks away, I pulled into a residential neighborhood and parked against the curb. Hands were shaking. No witnesses in sight. I cried. The sum total of that energy wasnt released; only a fraction. And I am a woman. I needed to cry to exhaust it. Not throw a fist. Thats both my most celebrated moment and my most shameful moment of my anger. I think Ive only told a couple of folks about that Claudia being one she knows everything. And Bryan. Just felt like a story I wanted to tell. All the subtext of feeling preyed upon in the world. Qualifying my behaviour with a flourish of a dramatic narrative. For explanation and justification.

 oh, and yeah; i got a new granite bistro table out in the yard. just need chairs. man, i did all of that with a huge pile of sand place in the middle of it, courtesy of Dad. Not only did i fill two big boxes of extra sand, i played like i was a lacross player and hucked maybe 50 loads of it from a huge shovel. just chucked it out onto the hill behind my place. that's going to come back to me pretty soon.

 Still 82 at 4pm. And a high of 90 today... so lovely to smell these dry/warm breezes. So check it out. Im done now. Spent an hour yesterday and three hours today of Charlotte work to get all the sand/soil swept into the cracks. The worst part was the extra bits that had to be swept up and disposed of. Maybe eighty pounds of it. And by Charlotte work, you all know that I did it in high gear, forcing the issue until I was out-of-breath and aching. I busted ass in other words. What a chore. A chore that Im proud of. And frankly, a chore Im grateful to have. What a big deal it is that I get to live here alone. Think about that Dad bought this place to augment my quirks into total functionability. (no emails about that not being a word) Too add to the Charlotteness, I did it all in my black bikini. With spf 2 on my bod, I soon realized. Forgot Id refilled a bottle with something else. At least I keep my face out of it. I like being carded at 25 even for being at least 18. its not going to last if Im not careful. You know, I think some might be inhibited by the presence of strange men while youre busting your hump in a bikini. Granted, Im ten pounds heavier that I want to be. So like, its not like theyre looking. and truthfully, I dont give a fuck. Im on high alert in my subconscious. I could go off, and when I do, it wont be in vain. Im remembering the time

 Yeah, I could be at school right now. But its 85 and not yet 10am. You work the numbers. I elected to sleep some more this morning having felt so bad all weekend. Nothing taken to help me sleep last night and yet I still slept a good ten hours or wonderfully restful shuteye. I dont feel any better, of course. Even with the healthful measures taken over the past days. Cant expect things to change overnight; unless you mean my descent from having a jolly good time of things. I realize I will have to leave the house today. First, for my Xray. Taking it easy has helped the swelling but not the pain. Then maybe to moms so I can see the Sopranos episode I missed last night. I heard a synopsis on the radio this am. Tony asked out Melphi. Oh man, is that cool. I mean, if youre me and those unethical situations create better than usual sexual tension. Even if the rest of the show sucked, Id still be a faithful viewer just for that dynamic. Melphis kinda hot in her way. Yes? I narrowly escaped a cutting session this weekend. Which is alarming to me since it has been since I started these new meds that I did that. And I sure as shit wanted a pack of cigarettes. But I didnt. I know Im under a lot of stress right now, and I know I need to be more patient with things. I really want to try to get back on top of my moods. Itll only get worse the more time I allow it to happen, this despair/depression. Willful suspension of disbelief. Got to pretend for a while, I think. Off to take care of my ailing bod. I tend to worry that Im a hypochondriac with all the medical blips on my map. The heart thing is total anxiety, I realize. It just seems in error that a 25 year old would have such a broken body. Im a broken record. I need air.

 and a friendly reminder from mom here: don't forget to lube up with lotion to compensate for this week's weather! 90+ here today. whew! drink lots of water, and wear your sunscreen tomorrow! now that the yard is done, i just may have to reclaim my barbados bronzing. just in case i make it back there before summer comes. diet time.

 i wanna go see the new charlie kauffman movie, eternal sunshine of the spotless mind. anyone heard of this?

 some comic relief sent by paula... Cornelius getting his head stuck in her shoe. dim. vato's still gone. resenting the current cats mucho.

 What a draining weekend. Really scraping the bottom of the barrel here. I spent all of yesterday tucked into bed watching bad TV I was too depressed to change the channel away from. I spent it thinking. About Rallin and what that leaves me with, about the lgbt group and how Ive put it away for now, about school and work about the fact that I wasted a whole weekend staring at the ceiling. Bryan and I both have hit a low spell. Sharing our awful secret with each other last night felt good. Smart of him to have me over for dinner and a dvd. I needed to get out of the house, big time. Today it felt more important to catch up with taking care of myself, to prepare for the upcoming week. Nail filing, foot lubing, washing sheets, and getting a sweat on in the yard (this time to sweep in piles of sand into the cracks between the stones). No, I think it was the visits to the career counselor that constituted the last straw. Not looking forward to employment possibilities. Instead, trying to find something that would provide for my want for solitude, my paranoia of being preyed upon by the world, my inconsistent disposition. Plenty of fun, you know. Maybe Im just extra bummed out right now because of the circumstances of the moment and shouldnt be thinking about things too much. Yeah, its a down day again. So like Im a little unsettled hearing that psoriasis is more than an unflattering thing to admit having; its an autoimmune condition of the scalp much like alopecia is, the condition that made my moms hair fall out (and her mothers). mom says casually, Well, youll be fine if you try to live a stress-free lifestyle. Its stress that brought it on for me. Ok. Um, but should I mention I chipped my teeth twice this week? Not just by grinding my teeth in my sleep but that whole chomping down on them like chicklets. Back to making small goals. Like, tomorrow I need to get my ankle xray. And I need to follow up on my heart thing now that Ive been granted approval by the hmo to get it looked at. I need to watch what I eat Im creeping up there again, and it doesnt feel good. Ill work out again once my ankle swelling drops to normal. And take my meds. I skipped them yesterday. And I need to follow up on the attorney situation, the paying of my bills out of my settlement. Having to screen phone calls to avoid creditors isnt conducive to a stress-free life. Nor is the further fucking up of my credit good for my future. A sound plan, I think. Seemingly little things. No big decisions. Just little stuff.

 as requested.. the evil Oliver.

 born gay.

 Ever wake up to find things in the house that you cant remember acquiring the night before? Like a pack of cigarettes, unopened. A stack of mail (when did I go get it?). things left on the stove, a filthy mess of cheap food partially baked onto the enamel. And in the garage something I do remember, faintly. Dropped a whole bag of groceries with a wine bottle in it sending explosively charged glass fragments all over the cement floor. And contaminating all the paperwork for my insurance woes with redness. Drank Jacks. enough apparently to black out. On account of forgetting to eat again. silly, silly girl. So right now Im enjoying a large bowl of the thick veggie stew I prepared a couple of days ago. shitake mushrooms and zucchini lots of good things. I suppose Im not doing myself any favours by using alcohol to quell the various pains in the body. I got a hold of my xrays yesterday and a printout of my diagnosis. No recent fracture. Theres a bone fragment in there, and theres a 4mm curvilinear fracture along the joint. So what does this say? That I need it scoped to take out the fragment? I wish this was all I had to concern myself with. Before rushing off to Julian yesterday, my dad spoke of suing the insurance company. Yep, just when one lawsuit with Trader Joes has been settled, Im looking at another one. The reason of course is the sudden cancellation of my coverage without a moment to find alternative insurance. Exacerbated by the ankle break. Like, I have to wait until NEXT THURSDAY to get in to see an orthopedic surgeon. I sent off a payment (160/mo) via express mail yesterday to get it reinstated through another means. Such crap. But on the lighter side, its the first day of spring. And as if on cue, my very first rose (fragrant cloud) has come into bloom. Its supposed to be dark orange with a touch of yellow, but it came out florescent pink. And oh-so stinky. Im pleased. The last couple of days Ive noticed the added sweetness in the air. Im encouraged. Reminds me of weekend morning soccer games and days at the beach. Thrilled. Good news. The judge ordered 1700+ to be taken from my settlement to pay off some of my bills. And theres another request in the works. Which means I can answer my phone again. and pay off my cable bill and get my telly turned back on. Happy days. Anyone know how to fix scars? Then Id be all set.

 what i want for my birthday...

 Why, I cant remember when I felt so giddy in the past few weeks! What brought it on, you ask? Friends, gather round. Mothers, shield your childrens eyes. Prepare your minds for a rollicking good time. I unveil to you. (drum roll and assorted fanfare) His PICTURE! Yep, the pretentious asshole Ive been pining for all this time. I stumbled upon a gem in a search for homework links on a faculty listing website. Vote now: how much more credibility do you give to my side of things after seeing this image?

 I was a touch uncertain of how the panel discussion would go, uncertain of what I would say. In the few minutes I had to prepare before I got going, I tried to outline a few moments of my coming out story that I expected I should touch on. Also trying at the same time to anticipate what the class would want to hear me address. All comments from the class were thoughtful and coming from a respectful place. All but the one lesbian woman who wanted to know why none of us spoke about the positive experiences we had, why all we spoke about was the trauma associated with our difference. Um, because you asked us to share our coming out stories? Like, how much time do we each have? Five minutes? Yeah, Im not up there to dictate a book. And shit, how much shit in general did we all four leave out. I also left out the sandwhich I ate one day in the cafeteria. Anyway, it was awkward trying to clarify how its the painful parts we remember most. I think she just wanted to highlight her own fabulous experience coming out. Dumb chick. There's always one of them. The real excitement was right before the class began and Daniel walked in to warn us that he heard that Aneil Rallin was coming to listen. My heart sped up with a quite literal fight/flight response. Im quite clearly not a fan of the boy. My voice was strong and sharp: What? Thats just what he heard, he said. Thank bloody god he didnt show. I was half preparing a underhanded comment just for him. Maybe something like, Theres always /someone/ out there who projects their own insecurities onto people. Maybe then say hello to him. Ankle still broken. Letha (man, I just love her) was in the class, and she and I spoke a bit after the class. Mentioned to me the likely chance that I break my ankle even worse now that the break has begun if I dont get it fixed soon. Shes right. Injuries happen on top of other ones, exploiting the weaknesses. Its proving to be much more complicated to treat it now that I found out that my insurance has been cancelled. And the COBRA insurance information didnt arrive until two full weeks after theyd cancelled me, leaving no time to make a seamless transition of the matter. Bastards! Well, I suppose Im not too terribly surprised seeing as though they should have been informed of my p&s status and cancelled me months ago. seems that once they realized their blunder, they went to it right away. (its been hard to type with a cat on my chest and another one circling the waters below me) So Im still not sure how I can get this fixed. Buy an aircast and try doing it myself? then pay for another xray in 6weeks? Maybe itll be at least 400 to get it casted. Jesus, these lovey cats. Feline pilot fish.

 A day well spent. Save for the delayed reaction on the part of the insurance company. Still I walk around with a broken ankle. Theres like one single spot that screams at me when I put my foot down. Maybe because it remains so localized, I can ignore it and go on with my day. A day that was marked by good old fashioned girl time waltzing through a mall with two lovely girls looking for purses. Yeah, try n swallow that, you friends who know me rather well. Not only did I enjoy it, I did it all on a broken bone. Gabe has such a marvelous bone structure going on for him. I keep apologizing to morgen for using the adjective, but I stick with my assessment; hes beautiful. His eyes, his skin hes fit. Just because I dont want to have sex with men doesnt mean I cant be a qualified judge of them! What children those two will create At lunch, Im trying hard not to watch the tennis match being aired on one of the screens lit up in the place. A match of Andy Roddick and Marat Safin. And I spoke of my oath to be forever straight if I could breed with Andy. Im strangely in love with him, if only for his beautiful mouth. Which Gabe has too, but thought better than to make the connection verbally in mixed company. Being that his fiance is sitting with us, a girl I once kissed in a moment of drunken silliness. Im so thrilled for those two. Really, theyre like the ideal couple to me. theyre both interesting and developed theyve passions and intellects, and they seem so perfectly matched it makes me recognize the inherent lack attached to my lifestyle. Im jealous in some lights, its disturbing for me to look at, my exclusion from that reality. But today is not one to dwell on the lack or the darkness. I think Ive earned a respite, a break from all that self-induced stress. I slept last night without grinding my teeth or chipping one. Im on a strict plan to make sure that trend continues. Why do I wait until I accumulate that much obvious empirical evidence to support a theory before I take measures to repair the problem? Why always the extremes? Yuans class brought up an interesting point today re: Lyotards The PostModern Condition. How empirical science gets x-amount of funding while learning how to feel (not think) gets little to nothing. Just imagine if your inner world was as financially lucrative to investigate as is your outer environment. And if those funding this research hadnt made their billions by selling petrol. Why on earth can we develop Photo Shop for instance. Anyone able to get to the full capacity of that program? No. because its too complex and wonderful. So, why with that- why are we still without a decent electric car? Funding. Whats invested in. Theres a new CD circulating out there among the ltwr girls if you happen to get ahold of it, my apologies. Its all my fault ;) I should just start a thread here for comments. I know Ill be receiving them soon anyway

 Awaiting permission Ive only a few short minutes before I need to rush off to school. To get a decent parking spot so that I dont have to walk too far on my broken ankle. Hopefully Ill get permission to see a ortho today. And a psychologist. Both require the go ahead from the HMO. I still cant get over that; sending someone away with a broken bone. Why wait for permission? What are they going to do? Say no?

 So, the other night I was reading my book about SIV, Self Inflicted Violence. I came across a description of what those of us who participate in it tend to do. I read off a list of the following: -cutting with razors or sharp objects -burning with matches, cigarettes, etc. -pulling out your hair -preventing wounds from healing and the one that stuck out: -intentionally breaking bones. Now, to me the first list seems expected. But when I read the last one, I shuttered. Whod break a bone on purpose?! Sure, the other methods listed are horrible too. but But I broke my ankle. Not on purpose as such, but through actions that disregard my bodys heath history. I keep pushing, and it cant take it anymore. I cant do the splits anymore. If nothing else, I have a loose left hip that I fear dislocating. And then I think that time when I was 13 and there was a tournament game coming up that was so full of pressure. I was beside myself with angst, I remember. I knew how much this soccer team depended on my performance. So I got out of it. My gently hitting my knee with the sledgehammer in the garage until I got the required discoloration needed to have a valid excuse to sit out the match. Am I a taco short of breaking my bones on purpose? Did I break my ankle on subconscious purpose? My back too? No I just put too much pressure on myself. When talent and a grossly inflated egotism collide that soccer scenario was just cruising for a bruising. The whole experience was loaded with fodder for future problems. But this current thing? Same, yes? The back? Try to outdo every one at work? It fits a pattern. Which leads my mind to deduce that its my fault and resultant of a faulty ability to set limits. And isnt that the problem underlying every thing?

 my second peace corps essay... written in one breath in the last hour. think i'll go ahead and post it to my application... you know me and my aversion to rereading my writing. Essay 2: A Passion to Create the Change I Want to See in the World It takes little more than a quick trip to the grocery store to realize how incredibly fortunate I am to live where I do. Coming from a moderately wealthy family and having grown up in a city most consider a vacation destination, my sense of gratitude has the potential of being somewhat overlooked. So many of the fruits of a prosperous life remain out of reach for such large numbers of people on the planet. Simple things like clean drinking water, a rainproof roof over my head, and the shoes on my feet are essentials I overlook more often than not; let alone access to health care, food in abundance, and the freedoms of being an American citizen. Living here, it takes a deliberate measure of recognition to draw my attention back to the larger picture, to the larger implications of safe and sufficient living conditions. This is where travel and intercultural exchange fulfills its most essential role. Its about developing and maintaining this world-view awareness. Coming from a culture where self-indulgence seems to be a requisite characteristic for citizenship, theres an added necessity to leave our comfort zone to experience how the rest of humanity is fairing in their plight to establish a harmonious existence. I live within an hour from the Mexican border and Tijuana in particular. A quick walk down one of the side streets can be a shocking experience for the unaccustomed. Poverty and political corruption take their toll on the inhabitants creating a climate of desperation and corruption. Yet beyond this lies a vibrant people with an incredible history. Having studied the politics and the people of this nation in college, the education opened my eyes to the underlying factors that contribute to the countrys current troubles. Additionally, having grown up in San Diego, I share this culture and history to a great extent. Our lives are conjoined, defying the boundaries drawn geographically. And in fact, the entire planet is living a shared existence, disregarding the demarcations of national boundaries. Technology has been able to connect us and bring about a shared awareness that has changed the face of civilization. We no longer live in our own private cities and villages; we regard matters that occur in remote parts of the world as serious and significant event. We share a sense of community that extends beyond the visible horizon of our daily doings. By virtue of this extended community, it is important that we strive to be good neighbors. Amplified by the current administrations foreign policy, our American reputation has been tarnished. It is programs like the Peace Corps that serve to amend this perception of our people. By offering our assistance to those who express a willingness to accept it, we are effectively bridging the divide between politics and people. We are replacing the worlds speculative discrimination of Americans with real life experience that tells another story. We are replacing rhetoric with action. Helping others is key to living a fulfilling life. On whatever scale that takes place, the proactive attitude is one I value. I give my all to those who ask for my assistance. Whether it is a child or a fellow classmate, I take pride and derive pleasure from being able to offer something of myself. I recognize that I am not a universe unto my own; and I do it out of love, not obligation. I see clearly that I am I tremendously passionate person. I like big projects, I enjoy seeing it through to an end, and I focus incredibly well. My drive enabled me to become one of the top five soccer players in San Diego County when I was younger. I channel a lot of my energy into language and writing these days, and I consider my endeavor a shining success. More than that, I feel satisfied with my achievements and my ability to go further. My potential and my energy cannot be wasted. I realize that I am at a pivotal place in my life being on the cusp of graduating college. Many directions are open to me. Im blessed and grateful for the agency Ive earned and inherited. More than anything, my heart tells me to use this time to create positive change in the world; to utilize my energy for something that matters beyond what serves me alone. The Peace Corps is calling me to contribute my gifts to the world.

 ahhhh... .just needing a mini-break from the essay writing. for the peace corps, not for school.

 Do you ever wish you were born a gay man? I swear, I have these moments more often than I feel blessed to be a lesbian. I throw on some music from the queer male cannon of the 80s and 90s, and I cant help but feel cheated out of the personal ownership of these songs. You know the cannon to which I speak. Lets go over a few: The Smiths New Order Erasure Pet Shop Boys Depeche Mode David Bowie Ok, so youre with me now. What gay boy do I dream of being? A few from Queer as Folks cast: Justin for sure. He still has that boyish yumminess Ive been accused of finding attractive. Second is Mr. Honeycutt. Both are so beautiful, itd almost be as cool as being a woman. Fantasy figures. Not like the ugly truth embodied by Rallin. Ive got my cock-ring/leather bracelet on again tonight. Is that an homage to my gay male counterparts? Im thinking I need something more substantial on my left arm than just this; theres a lot of skin to cover up. At least I never have to think about actually needing something to aid in my keeping a hard on. What a pain. A drag. The new Bowie album is kind of a lovely bit of slightly manic/angry wonderful. Anyone heard it? Think Ill queue up a bit for the night as I retire. You know, if I had my brothers old bike, Id be using it to get around. And would probably be out at a bar right now. But instead, Im staying safely indoors. Just enough entertainment here to keep me from wandering off on foot. Think Ill post on another site some of my favourite new music acquisitions.

 Ma Recontre Bertrand Burgalat - Laurel Canyon Soundtrack Shit, this place is so clean, it looks like a brand new condo. Which is, well, what it is. Just getting it back to its pristine condition. Makes me want to have guests. Someone to share my warm, clean sheets and the new 30 dollar sound system I installed. I have to qualify the new stereo system comment with the price just so yall dont think Im pulling your leg when I say that Im broke. Feet propped up on pillows to drain the swelling made worse by a long shopping trip with Pete and Paula at Ralphs. I needed like everything, so I went to town throwing things into the cart. Having a way to get all of this back up to my house was an opportunity I had to capitalize on. And then Paula tells me, no, this is our treat, so get whatever you need. God, theyre generous with me. so so blessed and grateful. My barren fridge finally looks like someone lives here. Ive got some email to catch up on and some films I want to get to before the weekend is over. _The Rules of the Game_, an old French film, and Woodys _Husbands and Wives_ that I havent seen in years. Just some fun stuff to enjoy on break, to relax to to give me an excuse to rest my ankle.

 Pet Shop Boys - West End Girls The ankle be damned. Its not going to get any worse before my surgery (unless I roll it again), so Im wearing some tread on my tennies strolling back and forth from here and the mini-metropolis down the street. Feeling a lot better at least getting that much for exercise. i'm losing weight. Ive a pre-surgery goal to drop five more pounds - not a lot when you're 20 pounds overweight. Its not natural for me to be so squishy! The cardiologists office called at noon today wondering why I havent come in for the heart monitor stuff. Yeah, like Im anywhere near taking care of that health hiccup. I explained the more pressing matters. She promised to get the insurance approval extended. Am I a hypochondriac? Dinner plans tonight with Paula and Pete. Sweet that they offered to take me out, help me to shuttle heavy things like cat litter up to my abode. And to loan me crutches and a walking boot for my post-surgery use. Secretly wanting to meet the new kit-kats, i know. Open windows, load music, and a whole lot of cleaning. the a walkie to Starbucks.

 Ha! Even my ankle is unstable. Thats the prognosis. I have to have surgery. It's "unstable," meaning it slips out of joint, and has a bone chip that needs to be taken out. The ligaments need to be reattached, and there's a place on the talus bone that's supposed to have cartilage... and may be messed up. Yet Im super thrilled that I can do something to get it fixed! Finally! Word to the wise; immobilize an injury after it happens the /first/ time. Without surgery, Ill just keep messing it up again and again. Mom went with me cause Ive got no car and in case I had to have a cast. Nope, just reconstructive surgery. (shrug) so we went to Nordstrom afterwards and shopped a good four hundred bucks away. Nothing for myself. Just a couple of hundred dollar shirts for my brother and my uncle and some cozy Tommy Bahama sweatshirt for mom (150!!). no big. Glad I got to keep my ATM card in my pocket. The one that I didnt lose. That makes two Ive lost in the last month. Drunkard! I walked to Frys after a twelve pack last night. I wanted out of the house and it felt so good to walk the couple miles Id already walked yesterday. so tack on four more miles. I dont remember when the card and my license slipped out, but someone found it and called to have it cancelled already. Glad I received a back-up. Silly, silly. God damned ankle is throbbing, burning in places medication time. Luiss birthday is tomorrow. My brothers too. Oh, he found out today that he finally graduated over at UCSD. And his commencement ceremony is a month later than mine!! Hahaha Ill beat him to it after all. Time to plan some parties.

 since i got an --A-- on this paper (smirk), i thought i'd post the fucker up here. i know Paula will wanna read it. excuse the formatting... i don't think a paste will allow it to come thru properly. The Language of Madness: Virginia Woolf and the Catharsis of Creation The role of the author in the creation of a work of literature cannot be overlooked or cast aside as irrelevant. As in the case of the fiction of Virginia Woolf, the role of the author is an integral factor to understanding the foundation of her creations. In Mrs. Dalloway, Woolf engages in the catharsis offered to her by writing fiction. It offers her a mode of communication that allows her an opportunity to transform her madness into coherent language that others can read into. Through this work, Woolf uses the character, Septimus, as an embodiment of her experiences as a mentally ill person. Through him, she is able to transmit her inner chaos to something outside of herself, and to find a counterbalance for her mood swings. The novel provides her with an opportunity to write back to the psychiatrists who lorded over her during the course of her time in treatment and ultimately to give a voice to the incoherent mind of Septimus and similarly affected manic-depressives. The unstable energy of Virginia Woolfs manic-depressive disposition offers both extreme distress as well as fits of brilliance as it fuels her creative drive. Her stuggles between these two extremes is captured in her personal writing, A Writers Diary. In it, she tackles the fluctuations by writing, both by her diary entries as well as her fictional endeavors. In her diaries she writes, the mad part tries me so much, makes my mind squirt so badly that I can hardly face the next weeks at [The Hours] (WD 56). Here, she expresses the difficulty of managing the intensity of her energy to where she can continue to write within some bounds of comfort. On the polar end of this intense drive to pour out her thoughts onto paper are the bouts with depression that loom over her. It makes her writing a challenge and a burden to her wavering disposition. She writes: ...this slight depressionwhat is it? I think I could cure it by crossing the channel and writing nothing for a week (WD 62). In an entry a single day later, she contradicts herself. But its a question of work. I am already a good deal pulled together by sticking at my books (WD 63). Her writing is the focal point of her life. It is both her outlet for channeling her energy as well as the activity she fears is contributing to her decline. Yet, she continues on with it as a necessary means for her to give language to the exploration of her inner world. This ability to communicate her state of mind is at the core of her impetus to write her novel, Mrs. Dalloway. Through it, she is able not only to give language to her character, Septimus, but can also put words to her personal struggle so that she too will be heard. Septimus is Woolfs alter ego in many ways. In Roger Pooles work, The Unknown Virginia Woolf, he writes, Virginia has chosen in Septimus a perfect objective correlative for her own state of mind in 1912-13 (Poole 186). He suffers from the unspoken and incommunicable elements of her own problem (Poole 186). In the novel, Septimus is at the mercy of the physicians in charge of his mental health. These physicians hold the virtue of being licensed by society to deem one sane or insane. Yet, Septimus is unable to make himself known to these men. His world can only be communicated through abstractions. This break from empirical thinking leaves the doctors at a loss. You served with great distinction in the War? The patient repeated the word war interrogatively. He was attaching meanings to words of a symbolical kind. A serious symptom, to be noted on the card. (MD 96) Rather than attempt to read into the most transparent of these abstractions, the investigation is halted at the mere recording of the behavior. The attachment of meaning to words of a symbolical kind is not so much a symptom or a problem in and of itself; it is evidence that Septimus is in fact showing a glimmer of hope that he is reachable. But without the employment of insight, the doctors and we, the audience, cannot say with any certainty that this broader analysis would prove fruitful. This experience parallels Virginias hospitalization and treatment by Henry Head in 1913 (Poole 188). She too was branded mad by a[n] institution of psychiatry that interpreted her philosophical despair as something physiological. This hopeless inadequacy of the medical community is made as a source of powerful contempt by Virginia. Through her character drawing of Septimus, she calls attention to the very foundation of what society considers madness. It is a label assigned to this man without consideration of how he came to appear so. The war and its trauma has scarred him, yet no investment is made into this line of analysis. Like the work of Michel Foucault states, civilization disciplines madness to suppress its truths while art recaptures truths branded madness to confront the world with the necessity of change (Froula 15). Whatever truth may be hidden within the fragmented ranting spoken by Septimus is dismissed as nonsense. Woolfs art functions to recapture truth, as it appears to him, and turn it back onto the culture that discounts it. In doing so, she effectively challenges her world to reexamine the fundamental basis of naming someone as mad. These physicians embody the cultures refusal to examine the larger questions brought out by the war. Like many Britons, they have turned the madness of the war onto the soldiers. It is treated as an individual illness, something that resides within the patient and is, in a sense, self-created. However, Woolf is extremely careful to give Septimus Smiths emotional anaesthesia a particular origin, a definite cause and a precise moment in time (Poole 187). Septimus is a victim of the war and is suffering from shell-shock or post-traumatic stress disorder. In doing this, she is able to answer back to her own physicians. She outlines how madness can have a direct correlation to specific events and not merely be of a physiological origin. In Woolfs own life, it is the death of her mother, followed by many others, that signals the moment of departure from emotional stability. This was beyond her ability to speak about in 1913, but through the writing of Mrs. Dalloway, she is able to communicate it through Septimus character (Poole). Woolf sets up this binary character structure as a way of highlighting the contrast between the two as well as their unity. About her endeavor to create this in the novel, she writes: In this book I have almost too many ideas. I want to give life and death, sanity and insanity; I want to criticise the social system, and to show it at work, at its most intense. (WD 56) She goes on to say in The Hours: Sanity & Insanity. Mrs D. seeing the truth. S.S. seeing the insane truth. The pace is to be given the gradual increase of Ss insanity. On the one side; by the approach of the party on the other. (Froula 5) Both Septimus and Clarissa are character doubles for Woolf. Clarissa uses creation as a way of channeling herself; Septimus is torn asunder with troubling, disjointed thoughts, finally crying out in a fatal last gesture. Among the differences between the two in the novel is the element in Clarissa that allows her, that compels her to keep going, to throw parties as a way of preserving the invisible web that joins lives together. And Woolf, by writing this novel, is in effect creating her own web of connections between lives. Septimus finds himself irreparably separated from this community and cannot cope with his inner anguish; Clarissa manages her despair by creating community; Woolf manages her experiences through her writing. The catharsis of creation allows Woolf to channel her inner world into a coherent form, and by doing so, she follows the model set by Clarissa and continues to preserve the invisible web holding society together.

 and it's about time, 'cause tonight my ankle is f-ing killing me. drink! drink it away! I'm so proud. wanna look at my first born? urlLink duffbeerlabel.doc urlLink First Blush Beer.doc

 How bad is it? Well, Im listening to blue grass. Drinking sour limeaid. And trying to figure out how to manage being without a car. And assuming I had a car, how would I drive? I need a job to save money for a new one. Yet Im broken, and Im not supposed to do anything until I get it fixed. I rented a truck this morning something to get me to Trevors to watch him all day. I quite like it and i should. cause Im about to be seriously immobile. Then again, when do I go out? For school? Yes. Groceries? Well, occasionally. When else? Yeah, so Im going to be here- for a long time to come. At least for the six weeks its going to take to heal my ankle. The guy didnt hit me, but he did change lanes right into me. afraid to cram on the breaks too hard with my hurt foot, I did a combo break and swerve. So I hit the median with my front left wheel and smooshed it into the wheel well. Serious wheel damage, Im sure. Why am I sure? Because my luck runs this way. He didnt stop isnt that enough of a luck indication. Jackhole. And no, I dont have collision insurance. And my car is close to 200,000 miles. Its time, I fear. Time to retire it. Fuck, Im sick of driving. People are nuts. And its too f-ing expensive. I could get a job down the street somewhere at Longs or at Grappa. Then I could just ride a bike to work. Or better yet, somewhere a touch further. Help me out. Anyone hear of anything near me? Why am I not crippled with loss/depression? I suppose Im all full up right now, thanks. Just glad I didnt injure something else getting hit by a car. Luck is a matter of perspective, maybe.

 Oh, and you know those enormous containers of detergent you get at CostCo? Well, -somehow!- mine fell off the dryer and emptied its full contents onto the garage floor. blue slipperiness everywhere. Fuck me. I'm not going to deal with it now. Nope. Denial time. What a waste and a goddamned mess! Is it trite to even mention such things?

 {Radiohead Paranoid Android} Is it wrong to want special treatment? I just hiked the hill again (this time with only minimal pain) to get my butt down to the bank before it closed. But of course I missed it. So yeah, the never ending saga of being broke(n) continues on. Couldnt they have kept it open for another hour for destitute cripples like moi? Luis and Robin on their way over for some much needed party. To hell with those who dont answer my email invitations. Theres always a small core of dependable folks out there who outrank acquaintances by keeping up good friendly form. Time to scrub the filthy feet that took me to Wamu. No really! Flip-flops are a great choice for the infirm! Menu: grazing, mostly. BBQ time with shrimp and marinated chick breast. salad, hummus n breads, wines, and whatever else i can pull together. now begins the pain! ha, i was wondering when my good fortune would run out. just in time for company! (sound of a stiff drink being poured)

 for those of you who know my sara... here she is at the sex museum in amsterdam.

 You know what sucks? People are stalking urlLink Belle de Jour . Can't we just be voyeurs and love her from afar?

 Whats better? Pain or depression? I vote for the first. Which is why I again took a walk (in the rain!) to school this afternoon in order to return supplies before they became overdue. Since I checked them out with BJs card last Friday. I like her. I hope I get to hang out and smoke with her before classes resume. The walk helps me to balance. A little sweat and endorphins is all I really need. Fuck these multiple medications, yo. Wow. Ive got $2200 expected to arrive in the mail to me on Monday. Hooray! No more phone calls to creditors! Yet as of now, I couldnt afford to mail back a package I bought online for a birthday gift for someone that came too small. I walked the fucker all the way to the UPS store and had to leave it there until tomorrow. Seems the return label was simply that; it wasnt a prepaid affair. Who brings a wallet with them when theres nothing but red ink in there? Plans for the day: make the bed so as not to look bad in front of friends. get into the kitchen and chop up some onions for French Onion Soup!! Start the yeast going for my batch of bread. Stare lovingly outside at the showers. Read _Orlando_. And get the house nice and cozy for dinner and a movie with Andrea. Ah, yes. And a souffl for dessert.

 Anticipating what may be in my inbox this morning kept me under the sheets until after noon. That, and the hangover headache from letting a bit of pain devolve into a flat-out mind number. Opened up the blow-up bed on the living room floor and watched my favorite depressor film, La Pianiste. Nothing in my inbox to frighten me. just some lovely notes from people I love. What was I afraid of? Someone laughing at my weaknesses made verbal. Someone poking at my self-absorption. Nothing anyone could say would match my own chiding. Had the most interesting dream last night that I cant write about; it makes no realistic sense to put words to it. something about Leslie and some intuitive, structured performance of some kind that we shared and made beautiful. Like I was inside a computer, really. And then later some guy kept pushing me down and stepping on my back and compressing my insides to where I kept losing the air in my lungs. Damned boy! Oh, and that Rallin was on tv on some commercial, and I was cracking up being able to show him off to my world outside of school. Laughing because he was being exactly the person I describe very self-satisfied was I. strange night in my head. The sky is cold and grey with promise of more of the same. Still no car and still no money, so I may take a walk in bundled clothing to get some air and gather my thoughts. Get some real world interaction that goes beyond listening to Bareback er Saddleback Colleges radio station. Should I make a move to have a party this weekend? Theyve been so hard to plan with everyones schedules but I need to go thru the motions at least. Like taking a shower today and getting the mail (where on earth is that check!!? I need to pay my f-ing bills already!)

 so... does anyone out there know Kelly's physical address? i see this about her getting blood poisoning. and i feel so bad for her, for that pain and the spring break that has been thwarted. i want to send her flowers. or at least to drop her pressie for her b-day off at her doorstep. but i have neither her address nor a car. poor dear. i really like her, that girl. i care about her. this isn't about greasing other tracks. been spending the afternoon with my blog stuff, trying to pretty-up the interface. but i gave up. it's not as logical as you'd think. and i'm sick of tinkering. it's good enough. it's not for me that i change it up. but Kelly... and my brother. shoot, guys. my dad is like the lowest rated when it comes to having intuition about behaviour. although maybe he has a more keen sense than he usually lets on. but regardless, this is what he said last night... "She's Pregnant." What? we all ask. me and my mom are trying subtly to find out whether he's purely guessing or if he's trying to frame private information in a safe encasing. he kept with his guessing. all the speculation adds up. none of us could refute his asumption. and none of us wished to. god, my mom says, "this is what i've lived for." uh-hem. no pressure, charlotte. just, having babies is her only want from me. i'm actually a little teary-eyed that her sight are set on such hetero-bound goals. things i can't just make happen. i don't want my brother's happiness to be mired by my selfish rejections. but you know, this is the kind of thing i think about when i buy new razors. like i can reconfigure my inner make-up with external tools. oh, poop. now i'm crying. forget it. i'm gonna take a walk. take a pain killer, refil my buffer. and try not to think of how much my life is a disappointment to my parents. there's a million coming-out stories out there. what about for those of us who have to deal with our siblings getting married?

 cats are so loveably stupid and simple.

 Fucking christ again. I just spent the last two hours working to transfer my site to another blog hosting service in the hope that I could make the thing look a bit more professional, a bit more dynamic. But in frustration, Ive given up. Whats the effort worth? Alls I want is to have a background picture, to find a graphics-based blog site. One, of course, that I dont have to pay for. Anyone out there a pro at using Squarespace? I got really into developing one there, but the real meat of it was lost to me. I couldnt make it any more fancy than this one. So fuck it. and too, theres more important things to do today than waste away before the computer. Sometimes I wish I had a skateboard. Or that I had the trust in myself to throw on my blades. Theres some things Id like to do in town that I fear Im unable to on account of being crippled. Walking it is just so far yet Can you imagine me on a skateboard? Id be semi-lodged in a gutter somewhere at the bottom of a hill. Knowing me, Id go at it as if I still could negotiate a half-pipe. And end up looking like a sad old lady with child-like scraped knees and elbows. No more ego-strutting at this age. The body is far too worked. Im worried about Kelly. Is she ok? Can I help? Send her something to make a few moments of her day a bit better? Poor dear.

 fucking christ, my ankle hurts. and that means something when it's making me whimper after two glasses of wine, five beers, a chocolate martini, and a 32oz long island. no pain killers... and maybe that's the prob. toss one down the hatch, tout suite! i'm needing to change the appearance of this site in a big, bad way. i hope i don't lose too much of the extras in the process. or if i do, it's maybe a good thing. mmm... i'm intoxicated by my own scent: Chanel's Madmoiselle. And lusting for Incognito and Lemon Jelly. A good night to stay up all night playing with my desires... `

 Its time again for another installment of. The Strangest Searches That Brought People to My Site! In order of appearance: -no extradition treaty with the United States -Heidi Fleiss -Graf -Larry Fucking Flint -pepper sa te sauce -paranoia and manipulation -"ballooning boobs" -"chomping grinding teeth at night" and (in all caps, yes) "PARANOIA PSORIASIS" I kid you not, lovelies. Ver batim. This sort of thing is part of the reason why I have 170 hits only ten days into the month. I wonder if what they found in my archives satisfied their searches? Im home after a long day that was both exhausting and rejuvenating. I took Bryan up to the Ranch. Or rather, I let him drive me there. I want terribly to detail for you the miracle of the earth that I got to experience. The incredible beauty of the landscape, freshly born out of the ravages of fire. It was simply amazing being out there again. we took quite a hike along the cliff overlooking the San Diego river valley. Stunning views and awe-inspiring silences. Taking pictures of what we have out there is hardly a replacement for being there. Its my geographic spiritual center. And of course, I ran along hyping up the dogs, and I did it a couple of beers down all on uneven ground. I sharp pain punctuates the second I write the recollection. Im going to need an evening of quiet recovery. And some alone time to sit still before Ill launch into a recounting of the day. Later, my pretties.

 A dream Im hoping is not wish-fulfillment fantasy making itself known. I was at a funeral or a wedding (both sensations commingled) where I saw Claudias car in the lot. Everyone seemed to recognize how long it had been since wed been together so they helped us to meet, secret from my mothers knowing. Being hurried through narrow backroom corridors by old friends, I found her curled up on a couch with her kids. We held each other, made love, collapsed into feeling safe and utterly secure in the world. Shed changed. Softened, let go of doubts, grown more fully herself. And she whispered my name, and it unified all the years of distance and discord. She spoke to me, and it brought down every barrier of circumstance and past hurt. I woke up missing her. Feeling cheated that all that happened when I was too young to better negotiate the hard parts. But today, its mostly for not being able to fully engage in a more adult sexual sense. For being a little girl unable to be with her the way I wanted. What would have happened if Id met her at 26 instead of 16? Ill always be in love with her, I think. Or maybe, Ill always be at least partially consumed by my connection with her until I no longer love her.

 Sore throat, headache, green in my lungs. Not feeling it today. I still feel like going off to class, but I would be plenty upset with someone else if they showed up to sit behind me with a cold like this. I tested out my voice as I got up this morning to see if I could fake it, but the sounds I utter are a dead giveaway. So Gregor Samsa. urlLink But on a cheerful note, I received an email from KerriLou that brought a smile to my face. An email hoax that apparently got her. Something about the government beginning to charge a fee for each email we receive. Improbable at best, yes. But the immediate giveaway is the bills name: 602P. Not even a valid suffix. P for Parliament? (hehe) Because I know Ill get a lot of hits on my site for including the hoax details, let me take this time to educate: Prefix: Definition: Examples: HR bill originating in the House of Representatives h.r. 120 S bill originating in the Senate S5 HRES simple House resolution HRES221 SRES simple Senate resolution S.Res. 12 HJRES joint resolution originating in the House h.j.res.150 SJRES joint resolution originating in the Senate sjres212 HCONRES concurrent resolution originating in the House h.con.Res. 5 SCONRES concurrent resolution originating in the Senate s.con.res.45 PL bill or joint resolution that has become public law pl 107-25 And of course, only after the bill has passed does it adopt a suffix. Simple enough, yes? Maybe coffee will help to restore me to human form.

 spent my day at the nissan dealership with Bryan today... and what fruit? take a lookie: (courtesy of my tiny lighter-cam - images scaled down 50% - pretty good, yes?)

 Ah, nothing like beginning the day making a french press of Starbucks coffee while standing naked in my kitchen. And waving to the gardeners who happen to be outside my yard pulling weeds. Oops. Eh, whatever. Its the closest thing Ive had to a sexual encounter in weeks. Awakened to more news of the war in Iraq. How blessed I feel to be having no television and therefore no exposure to the images of those four civilians who were murdered and had their burnt bodies paraded through the streets. The continual mention of the event would certainly refresh those images in my mind something I definitely dont need. Theres a line I need to draw between staying informed about world events and protecting my sensitivity. The only death I want to welcome into my life is the day of the dead figurines I have on my desk. See? Death is fun!! Off to get my car this morning. And then to catch up on things left neglected since it got smushed a couple of weeks ago. you know, I almost dont want it back. Im afraid to drive, yes. But Im also getting to love walking. However Im not supposed to with the ankle. Being without a car has really simplified my life. Makes me long to live in London where having a car is completely unnecessary. And where I dont have to walk two miles to get a quart of milk.

 Thank the Lord there are researchers out there who really push the envelope by bringing about urlLink studies that yield a totally surprising result. Could it be? Watching TV as a child can contribute to ADD? You dont say? Contributes to aggression and obesity, eh? Fascinating.



 Can I exist on NPR alone? Yet again, I made the two mile trek to Ralphs and back. A full moon following me, and a slight springy feeling propelling my gait a little faster than Im used to. I feel the swelling gathering force in my ankles, but it really didnt hurt all that much thanks to my pharmacist. I retrieved some goods, and then as Im walking out I stopped to check out the ballot measure proposals some guy was petitioning for. Ive a strange lust for politics, so I stayed a while and went through all he had. I pretend Im educated, but my sources are somewhat limited to NPR and my parents conservative opinions/yelling spells. I signed most of them, but there were a couple I skipped. Primary education doesnt need more tax revenue to remain buoyant; it needs internal reform so the surplus of cash isnt squandered by unethical administrators. (if you spend it all unwisely, you can always cry for more - like CDF) And another one I had to question him on. Something about Megans Law to allow parents to go online and find the addresses of all the sex offenders in their area. Now, it kind of sounds like a good preventative measure. But I had to ask him: What about homosexuals? In some states, the simple act of sodomy is reason enough to add these people into that same database. Doesnt that worry you? The guy had little to say other than, oh, well. Theyre trying to marry and do all these sorts of things, and I dont think it matters much. So, you dont think homosexuals ought to be excluded from this label of sex offender? I didnt let him respond. Because, Im queer. And I dont think you should be publicly identified if you for instance get a blow job from your wife. Ah, the free use of language I enjoy. A woman walking out of the store turned around at the word queer. And then kept going when the word "blow job" (OK, two) was uttered. I mentioned Lawrence vs. Texas to highlight the fact that this kind of lumping together of sexual criminals and "deviants" still exists to a large extent and that more should be done first to clarify the issue. With cordial evasiveness, he placated my remarks and let me move on to the next petition without further disagreement. Blah. A part of me says, Sign it. Let the people decide. And then the informed, intelligent part of me says, People are too stupid and too uneducated (let alone devoid of enlightenment) to make such decisions in the voting booth. I /like/ that voter turn-out is so low. Stay home with your _American Idol_ crap, and leave the real decisisons up to folks who care enough to investigate whats behind the brevity of yes or no. I shook his hand as I left. Apparently, I was a bit more interactive than most who stop on by. He proffered his paw first. And as you who know me could probably guessed, I sterilized my hands once I was out of ocular range. Couldnt we all just bump forearms? Why does it have to be contact with the dirtiest parts of us? I need to begin a petition... So with that, I walked on home. Again, with a speed Im not used to. All the walking has paid off in stamina. Too bad its detrimental to my ankle's healing - the strain is only worsening the flawed healing of the bone and ligaments. Like all things I like and am good at. Writing, sports, pushing limits, enduring pain, and remaining in solitude for days on end Ah, the imbalance of being in ones mid-20s.

 Happy Easter? urlLink eastereggs That makes 24 hours since Friday night that Ive been without power in the place. Four hours Friday night and Saturday morning. And then it blew again last night (due, I assume, to an improperly executed job on Friday) at about 11. My fridge was starting to reach room temperature this afternoon causing me to worry a bit. Put my half and half in the freezer, clustered chilled sodas with the other spoilables. Looks like I wont have to prop a trashcan before an open refrigerator door after all. At least I got a lot of my reading done. Only a smidge of _Orlando_ since Ive gotten into a valuable habit of over-annotation. But what I really got done was prep work for my presentation on Post-Colonial Discourse (seems like it ought to be capitalized). An incredibly dense twenty pages going over the entire book my part is to go first, to lay out the framework of the rest of the text. Its the harder portion, I think, since I have so much to explain. And I only have five minutes to do it. Shit, I learned something, I spent a good amount of time resting my very angry- ankle, and I managed to intervene on TWO cat vomit episodes before they became more stains on my carpet. What a successful day! I even scraped up the pool of laundry detergent off the garage floor. Of course, I couldnt hose the rest away. With the power out, there was no way to open the garage door. Folks had their cars trapped on top of being s.o.l. w/o electricity. Back to the cats. Does anyone know why they keep puking? The fat cat has an eating disorder, Im convinced. This time he ate too fast and started retching and undulating ON THE CARPET nearest his food dish. I grabbed him and threw him (yes, I was in urgent-mode) into the kitchen where I can easily clean it up. Then the little one went at it I was tipped off by the sound of smacking lips like he was eating something. Far, far away from where the food is. I chased him down and threw him (again, yes) into a bathroom and shut the door. Torturous of me? It /was/ a dark bathroom. But shit! They puke twice a day! My plants are shredded, my carpet is continually spot cleaned with marginally acceptable success. Do all animals do this? Is it wrong to want to snap the little cat in half? If Bryan was here, hed insist I get out of the house. When I get this sadistically frustrated, he helps thwart disaster by intervening and taking me out. However, Bryan is not here. But I did get a call from him today. To tell me his car has been stolen! Yep, in the middle of his long-awaited road trip through California. He was parked at a brightly lit parking lot in a new BART station some 20 miles outside of the city of San Francisco itself. When he came back from the city, he found another car in his spot. No sign of the Saturn. Thank God he has good insurance theyre getting him a rental car for nothing for an undetermined amount of time. And his good friend Julie lives up there; he was there to see her. (Insert sounds of goats bleating and roosters crowing incessantly whilst on the phone with me) and it seems she has a little house on the property that no ones living in for the time being. So hes safe and sound. But still. People suck. Poor lad. Can he get home in a rental car? Must he fly and leave all his camping gear up there with Julie? (His gear that fortunately was unloaded for the very reason that his car could be broken into) And what about his car? Hell be cut a check for the bluebook, but that means hell have to start making payments each month again. Thus, no free fuck-around time. I feel bad for him. And Im so so glad I didnt go with him. Im in a state akin to holding my breath, just waiting to get my ankle fixed. And now that the other one is swelling and I can feel my heartbeat in my back, as usual. God help me if I dont have a glass of wine here at only 5pm.

 a note. however i should be asleep and put this thing away. or er-, turn it off. the reason why i write. the woman who first put a pencil in my hand during a particularly difficult time. i looked and i found her PO Box address. and i wrote her a letter. it's so important to me that she know how much her influence on me impacted my course. it's all stamped and sealed. if i wasn't about to fall out of my chair in exhaustion, i'd go on outside and pop it in the box. but alas, i have an uncomfortable day ahead of me. nothing like having your sexual identity held up to the light by a crowd of hetero women at the pinnacle of their pride. another convert = another celebration.

 How do you rate when your political views are stacked against those of most American college students? If you're as bored as I am, you'll go urlLink play with it . Hangover recovery sleep session commence. Got to be chipper for another fucking baby shower that I get to go to tomorrow with mom. Happy Hetero party time. I hope hope hope someone asks me tomorrow when I'm planning to breed. Or who the lucky man in my life is. I'll be by the chilled white wine if anyone needs me.

 urlLink Wilco rules. Now, if only my sound card worked... A good night with the girls, Kelly and Morgen. Of course, it took me til 4pm to be able to start my day. Made breakfast, looked at it, and bowed over the sink to vomit up my medications. Mmm, boy. Nothing like our Long Island Vacations. I sucked face with a woman (married!) I'd never met before... and subsequently forgot her name. That's bad. Which part of that is the worst? A note to garner some scrap of respect - I was marginally adult about the matter by fending off a playful pair of hands from my zipper. The bar was empty, but isn't the bathroom a more appropriate place? And shit, who can come anyway when you've downed six pint glasses of liquor and unknown quantities of girlie-shots? I drink precisely to dull my senses and stop feeling. Sloppy sex is great; sloppily drunk sex is not. Drunken Charlotte Mode : have people over after the bar kicks you out on a day that you spent groaning in pain and unable to walk. Then, in a white wife beater with nipples ablaze, begin cleaning with frenzied enthusiasm while whipping up a quick souffle while one guest makes an intimate acquaintence of your carpet. And what better to do following a night of hard drinking of hard liquor (and no food)? Apply for a job at a brewery! I've been thinking about that place for months... being walking distance from my house (if one is physically able to walk, that is). It's just a front desk position, but I'd be fabulously over qualified... and as Bryan said, "a fox in the henhouse." I met two boys last night at Penny Lane, my spot for a little pre-party drinkie. Dumb as dirt, but folks to chat with, drink with nonetheless. They wanted to come meet up with me and the girls later on, but it didn't happen. Too drunk to follow my -simple- directions. Truth be told, I was over it before they asked for my phone number. Boy #1: "Why would you want to study Post-Colonial literature?" Me: "Because the world is an increasingly smaller place, and the issues of globalism and the power dynamics of cultural identity come into play with all sorts of things we deal with in our daily lives." Boy #2: "What do you mean by globalism?" It was a whole lot of stupid sitting there in front of me. I wish I had a better soundbyte to relay that expressed it more clearly. But nice enough. Just simple. And goodness, it's a good thing they didn't show up. Twas a small party. Not enough ladies to go around. And not enough people to lose them in the crowd. I never know what kind of a situation I'm signing up for when I mix men I don't know and my drunken self making out with another woman.

 i hesitate to preface urlLink this link with any comments...

 urlLink Eureka in the bathtub! Insights apparent in brain activity!

 a simply shameful personal history in terms of fashion descision. warning: image contains acid-washed denim.

 Pain! ...like I never had back surgery at all. I went down on my knees in Auto Zone getting my headlights redone. Not a good position to find yourself in at heteromale world. So I came right home, tears streaming down my face and whimpering. Shit. Can I go out tonight with the girls or not? guess I wont be finishing the gardening I began yesterday. Not until I sedate myself thoroughly. And even that doesn't seem like a possibility. I'm SOL today. On the Feline Front: I found new food for Jingo that has him eating. Like, actually eating; not just licking at his food until the gravys gone. Soft dry food for old cats. Its pricy, but its better than having a furry skeleton gone stiff in the corner of a room. Altruism: I made another Walmart run today (chastise me if you like for throwing my money at the monster). While waiting for the light to change, I couldnt help but fish through my pockets to give a homeless man five bucks. He was so sunburnt, so worn and tired looking. he had a bike and a small radio with him that wasnt turned on (no batteries?). Here you go, man. Wow, far out. Thanks. Thank you so much. I smiled to myself at his use of the antiquated far out. I continued to fish through my car, remembering that I had a tube of sunscreen somewhere that I ought to give to him. But he took off on his bike, presumably because he had enough money now to go get a drink. I expected to find him back there when I left Walmart. Expected it so much so that I bought him some stuff. A big bottle of SPF 45, a bottle of water, some cigarettes, a lighter, and even threw in the unopened bottle of beer I had in my trunk (dont ask). I had a whole bag to give him, so I set out to park close by the intersection to hand it over along with some words of encouragement and understanding. But he wasnt there. More than that, his place had been taken by another guy. This time a youngish guy who looked way too fit and able to garner sympathy from this woman. I felt let down. For trying to be kind and being left feeling conned in a way. That spot do they coordinate shifts or something? Hm. I guess its important to remember that its not about my self-satisfaction. Who gives a shit if theyre organized? At least the guy could get a nip. Thats enough for a flask of whiskey. Enough to get a man into trouble. Or to make his day.

 You know what feels good? Spending money. And not the kind of spending that has your stomach in a not once you get home and unpack all your colorful plastic bags and realize how little you have left. Today I spent money on bills. In fact, catching up with all my past dues and paid them all up in full. Minus the credit cards, but those come next. Those get taken care of when I get my next advanced chunk of cash. I drove home after having lunch with Luis (and being served by Matt Pittinger!!), and as I passed the animal shelter I wondered if its kitten season yet. Yes, Im that silly. More is better, and when your cats are as well Ive had some odd luck with my past adoptees. Well see what comes to me. Back out to grab summore ground cover plants to bolster the beauty of the yard. Added a gardenia and some purple this and that today only paid ten for the whole deal, pots and all, so dont think I wasted my money on just fun things. But I want to open up some of the sterility of the rocks and plant creepers instead. Update on the surgery front: its coming. By two weeks from now. MRI showed /lots/ of fluid in there, caught up in different spots. And tears all over it, but that much didnt show on the films. The real relief is that the talus bone wasnt knicked away with all this damage. That would mean having to get in with a scope. So its /just/ ligament reconstructive surgery. Thats all.

 I reentered the mouth of the dragon today. A $2.5 million dragon breathing helium in the bottom floor of the XIMED building in La Jollas Scripps Hospital Complex. I came prepared with the sharpest weapon available; a couple of magic beans given to me by mom this morning. No stalks sprouting from these no, theyre Ativan. And I took them both. So long as my head rests outside of the beasts mouth, I figure Im fine. Its when Im staring at its throat only inches from my nose that I begin to really flip out into a terrifying anxiety attack. Happened twice before, so grant me allowance to medicate my sweet self before hand. Yet this one only required me to be in there up to my waste/chest. And still, I definitely needed them. Its all in my head, I know. But its too much for me to forget my irrational panic brought on by the fantasy ( a wider use of the word) that the thing will suck me in and trap me in there. Shit, its 2.5 million in equipment. Who knows if GE installed teeth?! Hm the toothed vagina imagery is ripe here. Let it go, I beg you. youre talking to a lover of being inside. I got it done, and Im all set to move ahead with things. Of course, things didnt run so smoothly /outside/ of the actual procedure. Where should I begin? I woke at 2am in a discomfort, an ill-feeling of anxiety and reflux. Chomped through about ten TUMS and tried to get back to sleep. Nothing. I tried a shot of liquor. Not even phased. I tossed and turned without more than 5min of consecutive shut-eye until the 5:30 alarm went off. I slinked into the shower and puked from exhaustion (yall know my stomach and its reaction to stress). I left the house at 6:10am with a bagel breakfast and a big bottle of acqua frizzante so as not to cause more acidity in my stomach that coffee would surely bring. And I hit the 78. east to the 15. and then I heard the traffic report. A small brush fire backing things up especially bad. And some police activity on 9th and Auto Park Way. I got in line and flipped on a CD after Id heard the NPR spiel. Watching the clock as we rolled along in 1st gear I was beginning to realize even this early on into my travels to La Jolla. I was never going to make a 7:30am appointment. And sure enough, it took me an hour and a half to get myself there. Late enough that they passed me up and went ahead with the next scheduled patient. I stood still as the office girls told me as much, breathing in the desire to weep and blowing it back out. A reschedule. This time for 4:30pm. Get in the car. Call mom from the mobile. The expected (and rejected!) response that insinuated that I blew it and should have left my house at 5:30 instead of sleeping in. not what I needed to hear, not anything that would reach any ends but to make me feel more punishment. I took the phone away from my ear for just a second, the impulse was so strong to hang up on her. But the plan was to hang with her after the appt for some goddamned baby shower shopping. The thought of getting to see my dogs was just enough to keep me in the conversation. Id hang out there. And Id take a nap with Annie. And then Id come on down again and get the fucker done with. Another hour-30 to get back up to school after it ended. And as youd expect, Im f0ing tuckered out. Yet I have pictures. And a persistent desire to better my blog interface. So vain.

 If your ankle's hurt and bloated, clap your hands! If your back is sore and broken, clap your hands!! Sure makes cleaning the house a chore. Managing this much space with the cleanliness specifications I require is a part time job at least. Cat messes, vacuuming, laundry, and dishes. My heart goes out to the single mother who has all this plus the kid(s) and a job. No wonder they plant their little ones in front of the tube while they clean up. I'd lock em in the room with me while I took a nap. Good news, ya'll. After much polite yet pointed urging by me, I finagled a quick-ass solution to my ankle woes. They were going to give me a Wednesday night MRI followed by a review of the results with my MD the following Wednesday. Not good. Then I'd have another week to 10 days to wait on the insurance company's approval. But I didnt give up V come home in a funk of acquiescing to the expected fate of being low on everyone's list of priorities in the medical community. I begged. Nicely, not pushy, but I begged with that cheerfully optimistic I-know-you-can-help-me kind of presentation of myself. and viola! I got PPO care for (grossly inflated) HMO prices! Projected schedule approval by the 21st. Surgery the week of the 26th. Woo-hoo! I'll be on crutches for graduation. But I keep envisioning a heroic moment when I go up there to grab my diploma (they mail it to you, so it's all a bit of a joke), I see myself grabbing the microphone to boldly announce... Little sisters out there!! Be wary of sports! Tape your ankles BEFORE you ruin them!! Get in the weight room by 13 and do weight strengthening for your lower quads to support your knees! You're predisposed to ruin them!! (as I'm being dragged off kicking and spitting by the university bouncers) J o i n T h e S w i m T e a m!!! ....

 Small signs of compassion seem inconsequential until you see the return come right back to you. tonight I was driving home from making a mundane exchange of goods with Bryan, and I came up on my yield/right turn lane. So I pulled up to a stop. Motion to roll down your window. An old lady did as I asked with a bit of curiousity in her face. Your tail light is out. Oh! Thank you!! And I drove off. Yes, a little full of myself for being a good girl and helping a random stranger. I was about a half mile from home just enough time to wax poetically to myself about the good will I was spreading. And when I reached my destination, I realized My headlight is out.

 You know how much easier it is to get through the day having actually gotten things done when youve gone ahead and eliminated the unnecessary from your life? Like not having television. And getting used to not driving so much. And by revising your social contacts importance and letting go of ones that arent as easy to maintain. Its freeing to rethink my priorities and act accordingly. Bryan, Luis, and Robin are the only folks that make sense for me to spend time with these days. And spending my efforts on my final semester of college (in its last month!!) is so much more important and gratifying than watching the idiot box or reading blogs. It feels good to be up early this morning in time for my classes. To be prepared mentally to engage in them, however marginal their interest level is to me. Im cultivating a sense of momentum here. Theres a lot to be done in the coming weeks. I call to schedule my MRI in exactly 14 minutes. Ill even do the scary tube-MRI if it means getting in and out faster. I need this surgery.

 Im a bad influence on Bryan. We drank several cocktails before finally cooking up some killer Mexican crap we got at the local Mercado. And then drank some more when we got back. He went to sleep. I drove home and have been IMing and blogging since my arrival. I need help. I wish I had a loving partner who would come over and be that for me. I shouldnt be driving. I shouldnt be walking around trying to clean my house of doing gardening for Christs sake. I need to lay back and be cool to myself. even if that means failing in certain senses. I just cant do my good work at school when Im walking on a broken bone. Why is this so hard for me to accept? Going to break my commitment to end fast food. Its been so long now. Yet I need to eat. And I need to get in the car and crank up the AC. I keep sweating. ??

 I kind of thought this would happen. Yes, its good to be doing something about the way I was humiliated by Rallin. But writing that letter opened it all back up again, and today Im not feeling so hot. Seems like my ankle and back hurt even worse when my spirits are low and Im crying. Damn. I cant shake the feeling that maybe this is all my fault. That its my unstable energy that created a problem. It isnt true, of course. Yet Im ashamed of myself for being part of a problem at school (again!) and that Formo knows about it. I derive so much of my sense of self within those walls. I wish I could have put this away until the end of the semester. Maybe Im expecting too much from myself and my tolerance capacity. Why cant I listen to Formo when she offers me an incomplete? I think I might have to give myself a break and take her up on it. it just feels like an F. I want a wheelchair, damn it!

 Hands are sore. Could it be from all the typing? The job never called me back like they said they would. Fuck it. Im over qualified as it is. Maybe they know Ill end up leaving for something better. Got an informational meeting about graduation to attend at school in an hour, so Id better wake up and shower already. But first my letter to the dean about what happened between me and Professor Asshole. In the interest of avoiding google searchability, Ill remove his name. Enjoy! I realize this is coming at a late stage of the semester. However, I need to take action to withdraw from a class Im still enrolled in. I stopped attending ltwr336 just a few weeks into the term. My reason for this is complex and personally upsetting. The instructor, Prof Asshole, requested that I stop contributing so much to the class online discussions. He suggested that I quiet my insights and allow the less experienced students dictate the pace of the discussions. His opinion, as he communicated it to me, was that I was expecting too much out of my classmates and trying to turn the class into a more advanced course than it is. He requested that I stop posting more than the minimum requirement to the WebCT discussion board. In short, he wanted me silenced and to give in to reducing the class to the lowest common denominator. This intellectual insult was personally hurtful. This is a class I looked forward to more than any other this semester. In any semester. This is the first time a Queer Theory course has been offered at this university. And being an officer in the LGBT student organization, I felt compelled to show my support. This class was a chance to belong at school in a way that queers dont typically experience. It meant far more than a three unit elective. I enrolled purely for the fun of it, fully aware that it would not count for any requirement towards graduation. I wanted to be there. I want representation to exist at our university. I discussed things with Professor Asshole in a meeting before our Friday class at the Starbucks on campus. Immediately after I sat down, he began to yell at me, drawing the attention of all who were around. I was humiliated in public as I tried to defend myself. His problem now was that I shared his request of silence with my fellow LGBT group members. I didnt realize that hes the advisor for our group and is therefore a part of the listserv. Few in our group knew this; he was never involved in anything we did. He received my words of frustrated disappointment along with the rest of the group. And he was angry that I was talking about it. Professor Assholes teaching style was apparent from the first class meeting. His anger and bitterness came through so strongly, I left his classes feeling worn down. He would routinely cut students off mid-sentence, telling one student, your opinion is bullshit, when the student politely tried to contribute to the class discussion. He alienated me and others with his combative style. He told me I was trying to be mommy by defending this student, clearly angry that I called him on his inappropriate behavior. He labeled my reaction to his behavior as acting out, and turned a completely reasonable discussion with my friends into a personal attack. Rather than rise above the situation like a professional, he made it very personal in his accusations. In a hostile tone, he ended his conversation telling me to write a book. At least this he seemed to realize was a bit too insulting, so he backtracked and rephrased it as encouragement. This was 30 minutes into the conversation and the point where he broke me down and I began to cry. I went ahead and attended class that day feeling stunned by the whole episode. When I returned home, I sent him a three-sentence email stating I would be dropping the class. This was the 13th of February; I have the email to confer with. I didnt tell him this, but the reason was clear in my mind. What is the point of being in a class where I cant participate? I was crushed. The compromises he laid before me are unacceptable. Twice in the following week, I saw that he was checking my personal blog. Im able to see the referring source when people either find my site through a search engine or if they click on a link from an email account. I saw his name having come through his personal email account. I cant say for sure why he was doing this, but it worried me nonetheless. There are so many talented people in my department at CSUSM. We have professors who care about what they teach, who care about their students, and who understand and value their impact on society. Professor Asshole is not, in my opinion, representative of this. I want to continue to respect my teachers and continue to believe that they are some of the most important figures influencing who I am and who Im becoming. There simply isnt room for him within this picture.

 this is great! nick hornby's high fidelity fans would be proud. warning: urlLink this is hilarious!

 how adroabe are my parents? man, my mom is three years younger here than i am now... little kids. dad's my brother's age. still, isn't my dad the handsomest thing ever? still is. just a tough nut to crack.

 having a total cheese-out night. ksbr, my funky community college radio station out of some enclave of LA, is playing something just wonderful - all sorts of Brazillian bossa nova stuff. recognize these lyrics? Tall and tan and young and lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking And when she passes, each one she passes goes - ahhhh... When she walks, she's like a samba that swings so cool and sways so gentle That when she passes, each one she passes goes - ooh (Ooh) But I watch her so sadly, how can I tell her I love her Yes I would give my heart gladly, But each day, when she walks to the sea She looks straight ahead, not at me Tall, (and) tan, (and) young, (and) lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking And when she passes, I smile - but she doesn't see (doesn't see) (She just doesn't see, she never sees me,...) got my ice sock on. mixed a drinkie. my foot is frozen to the point of burning.i just want to escape a little pain tonight. nothing better than with bossa nova. portugese is the most romantic language.

 "feed me, love me" -casey and annie Why does construction have to begin at 7am in my neighborhood? Arent they making all that money fast enough? Oy. Its a tiring affair having a broken ankle. I need me beauty sleep, you know? Lunch with mom to fulfill our matching pledge to ourselves to get out of the house at least once a day. Some Marshalls browsing. Then some dog time with the latest Sopranos episode. (Dewd! Is Tonys emotional side going to influence Melfis stance on dating him? Theyd better do it before the show is over, or Im writing David Chase some nasty-ass emails) Im up to my eyeballs in work, trying as I might to finish the entire semester before my supposedly-late-next-week surgery. Two ten pagers, a class lesson to teach on Post-Colonial theory, a five pager on Woolf that may or may not spill over into the 20 pager also due by the end. Lucky for me, Dawn has allowed me to take an Incomplete and finish when I finish. Which may be worth doing so I can actually create something stellar. Im determined to wow her again. Which has lead me to peruse article after scholarly article in an attempt to gather enough critical commentary to put pavement under my feet. I may be trying for an argument I cant make. Theorising that if Woolf dropped writing, she might have been able to escape the point of madness that had her kill herself. Yeah, so Im reading a ton to see if my idea will even flower. I just needed a break from all the work. Ill try to arrange for something good to enjoy tonight to reward myself and be kind to my aching body. Eat out at Churchills or something.

 Mmmm Im eating Meiji Pucca! Too bad the stupid program doesnt recognize the accents. Imagine pokki but round. Got saucy with Bryan tonight and bought a copy of my new love, _Les Regles Du Jour_ from Frys. Something Ive seen before and something compared to _Citizen Kane_ in terms of cinematic innovation. And the latter is Bs favorite. So I think I did us a favor, splitting the cost and having that film in our back pockets to loan out to soft-minded women who want to know more about cinema. You see, it was banned by the Nazis for its handling of marital issues. I made a CD for Amy my usual sort of eclectic mix. For her mostly this is the track list: - Snow Patrol - Chocolate -Thievery Corporation All That We Perceive - Everything But the Girl Before Today (Chicane Remix) - Jeff Buckley Eternal Life - Jeff Buckley Mojo Pin - Wilco Summerteeth - Cesaria Evora Petit Pays - Incognito Interference - Incognito Summers End - Lemon Jelly The Staunton Lick - Lemon Jelly Albion No one has ever accused me of having Y95 type tastes. Whatever that call phrase means. I just hate clear channel. And I do my best to broaden my tastes to go beyond that corporately prescribed crap. My ankle hurts. Will no beer mend me? Even my new FAVORITE BEER OF THE MONTH ? Stone Brewerys VERTICAL EPIC ALE? Feels like something I need to offer up to Heather Hayton in light of our Heroes and Epics class. But the Seamus Heaney parody will have to be enough for now.

 Did some light gardening today. And yes, when I found myself prostrate in the cedar chips, I heeded my back's calling for a break and stopped before really finishing the project.

 I made it to class today as well as my appointment with my VW professor, Dawn. Had to halt a few times to rest my ankle. Bending it to walk up stairs, like having it bear weight, is just not an option and I forgot. So its as swollen as ever and propped up on the window sill where it belongs. Dawn spoke of my option to take an incomplete in her class in order to have more time to finish my final project if the surgery really ruins me and keeps me from being able to work properly. I would have a year to get it to her and still have the grade amended according to my performance. Its an option that I wont take, but its nice not to have to worry about whether my medical will ruin my academic. Some words exchanged about whatshisname. I applaud her professionalism for not concurring with my concerns. She did let me know that it would be wise to talk to the department chair. I can even do it under the pretext that she not write anything down. Just to listen to what happened and keep it in mind for when someone else files a complaint. I hate having to speak up about something like this, but the guys an asshole. Somewhere down the road it should catch up with him. He cheated me out of an education. And compromised that of the other students who are exhausted by his anger. I think Ill get out into the garden and put some things into the ground. Get my mind off of closing things down (graduation, finishing what I started with Asshole) and onto planting something that grows.

 because i think there's room for one more...

 Why must I have school to distract me from being up on everything current? Political events are too much fun right now to be considering post-colonial discourse. A presentation to be given next week that I haven't even read the material for. So the story that no one's going to give enough time to in the AP world of news coverage? the Oil for Food program. Do I have sufficient time to rant about this? I printed out Claudia (ick) Rosett's article _ urlLink Oil-for-Terror?_ this morning assuming I'd bring it with me to class tonight or try to read it before. And quite honestly, my brain is a bit too fried to give this its due. But suffice it to say, this better not be brushed aside as another episode of mismanagement a la Enron. This is some big shit with far reaching implications. Should a full scale and thorough (+ multifaceted) investigation be launched into Russia, Germany and Frances' involvement with the, what, $ 25Billion dollars Saddam was able to siphon off from the program?s funds? Is everyone (Including fucking John Kerry!) going to admit now that the are in fact links between Al Queda and Iraq? The Taliban? The UN had better sort this shit out or disband already. This is some / serious / stuff here, folks. This shouldn't be a topic/concern that goes away anytime soon, so do yourself a favor and start reading up on it now.

 Writing on the Brain by Joseph Epstein I was recently asked what it takes to become a writer. Three things, I answered: first, one must cultivate incompetence at almost every other form of profitable work. This must be accompanied, second, by a haughty contempt for all the forms of work that one has established one cannot do. To these two must be joined, third, the nuttiness to believe that other people can be made to care about your opinions and views and be charmed by the way you state them. Incompetence, contempt, lunacyonce you have these in place, you are set to go. Want to read more? Hahaha... this is urlLink SO ABOUT ME !!

Lil Kim Like a calf freshly born on the pale fields of Mossbawn, she shimmers with the newness of life, staggers wetly, and speaks to the sky. Snoop Dogg Verse has found an amiable and challenging companion in the one they call Snizzle. Ludacris He has journeyed deep into the valleys of language, searching for a more organic phoneticism.

I speak here not of the antiquated muck of procreation, the spongy mechanisms of birth, but of the words rising from her throat like steam from rain-soaked humus.

 April 14 PDB: Bush Tie Threatens US Televisions One rule of television appearences is taking care not to wear a tightly patterned tie or suit or you will have the visual interference we saw with Bush. Obviously the people around the President refused to acknowledge or instruct Jackass on the "moir" effect of a patterned tie on TV because the term is French. Apparently not an effort to secure the homosexual constituent vote. What a dork. I'm glad I've urlLink turned off my television .

 What a terrible thing it is to wake up sometimes. A vivid and powerful dream starring a certain someone (it's so not fair to out her as a fantasy ? although most of you know I'm smitten). Makes me want to call her up and ask her to... uh... lunch. Makes me want to follow my impulses and be a little brazen sometimes, however well informed I am of her prudishness. Once in a while it's worth the risks. Just to grab her hand and kiss her palm. In my little life, experience tells me that you're not going to get your face slapped. Quite the contrary, miss mary. When I opened my eyes this morning, I was more that a little upset that I'd been imagining the whole affair. Looking at my increasingly squishy figure and feeling impotent to transform fantasy into anything more than that. I thought long and hard about going for a run (part drive, part punishment), but I opted instead to just fuck myself and take a shower. But cheer up, young one. I've got a job interview at the brewery in two hours. If only I could get women into my bed as easily as I get job interviews. When there's money involved... I want the new Woodward book. I WANT IT. I like this bit revealed by Dr. Rice on FOX News Sunday : WALLACE: All right. Let's talk about the book, Bob Woodward's account of the lead-up to the war in Iraq. According to Woodward, the president asked Donald Rumsfeld, secretary of defense, in November of 2001, 72 days after 9/11, to come up with plans for a possible war against Iraq. This is at a time when we were still heavily engaged in Afghanistan. True? RICE: The president apparently did talk to Don Rumsfeld and say to him, you know, "I need to know what my options might be concerning Iraq." The president, on September the 15th at Camp David, decided that our response to September 11th was going to be against Afghanistan. We planned for Afghanistan; we fought the war in Afghanistan. By the end of November, things are starting to wind down in Afghanistan, and I do think the president's mind was beginning to move to what else he would have to do to deal with the blow, with the threat that had emerged as a result of 9/11. And Saddam Hussein and Iraq was, of course this was the most hostile relationship that we had in the Middle East. It's not at all surprising that the president wanted to know what his options were before he began a course of diplomatic activity, of going to the United Nations, of trying to figure out how to carry out, by the way, a regime-change policy that had been the law of the land in the United States since 1998. WALLACE: The book also reports that after the CIA briefed the president in December of 2002 on the evidence that it had about the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, that Mr. Bush said this, and let's put it up: "I've been told all this intelligence about having WMD, and this is the best we've got?" And CIA Director Tenet answered the president, "Don't worry. It's a slam dunk." Did that happen? RICE: It did happen. The fact is that we all thought that the intelligence case against Iraq was very strong not just the United States intelligence agencies... WALLACE: But that's not what he's saying there. He seems to be saying, "That's all you've got?" RICE: Well, the presentation, let's say, was not, I think, overwhelming to people. But let's review what we knew about Saddam Hussein. We knew that this was somebody who has used weapons of mass destruction, who was still deceiving the international community about weapons of mass destruction, who had a kind of association with them that was... WALLACE: Dr. Rice... RICE: ... well-, well-known. WALLACE: But all I want to ask you about, how could the presentation to the president of the United States not be overwhelming? RICE: That's what the president wanted to know. But the intelligence underlying the National Intelligence Estimate, which was the basis for the president's the intelligence basis not, by any means, the entire basis for or against Iraq, but the intelligence basis, was pretty categorical. At that particular moment in time, the presentation was not that categorical. But it did say the National Intelligence Estimate said he has chemical and biological weapons, he's been improving his capability, and by the end of the decade, if something's not done, he could have a nuclear weapon. That was the assessment. Chris, even since David Kay has been there and Charlie Duelfer has been there, we are learning that the Iraqis did have an active program. They were seeking capabilities beyond those that they already had. And this was, after all, a state that had already succeeded in making weapons of mass destruction. Saddam Hussein was in violation, material breach of Resolution 1441. The president went to war on a total picture about Iraq. And he went to war on an intelligence basis that was sound. WALLACE: And what about Woodward's contention that Cheney and the vice president, Cheney, and Secretary of State Powell are so estranged on policy that they don't talk? RICE: Well, first of all, I haven't read Bob's book. And I'm really looking forward to it because he's a great reporter, he's a wonderful writer. And I think it will be a good read. He's explaining a complex set of arrangements in which we, of course, were trying to manage diplomacy and military issues and so forth. But I can tell you, I've had lunch on a number of occasions with Vice President Cheney and with Colin Powell, and they're more than on speaking terms. They're friendly. WALLACE: You don't have to pass notes between the two of them? (LAUGHTER) RICE: No, no, of course not. They're very friendly.

 what an adorable baby. this is alissa o'brien, tracy's youngest. pretty good picture i took, yes?

 Now, I wish I wouldnt get so fussy about those sorts of things. The baby shower was lots of fun. And no, nobody asked me any questions that required me to swallow hard and feel marginalized. About the only thing that irked me was hearing mom tell Kirstie, Youre part of the club now! Maybe I should have a sort of coming out party to celebrate my dealing with the world as a lesbian for ten years. Itll be ten years in August as far as coming out to my family. And just months earlier that I uttered a word to anyone at all. Do you think I could actually get people to show up? You think anyone in my immediate family would even acknowledge this little miracle as they would my pregnancy? Answer: No. I think my parents would be appalled that I even considered this a laudable feat. Tears in my eyes a little bit thinking about this. Taking nothing away from the wonderful news of my longtime friends celebrations, its just as hard to be a parent as it is to be queer. In completely different ways, of course. More queers kill themselves than do heterosexual parents. But to cheer things up and move away from topics of loss and suicide, its a fabulously clear spring day. A smattering of brilliantly white clouds and a cool wind that is itself a clarifying force. Reminds me of my silent walks alone through the streets of Bolzano. A good day for a walk. Take Bryan to the Encinitas street fair. Participate in the world a bit. urlLink Pictures from the shower .

 What am I having for breakfast? NOTHING. For lunch? Let's see if I can get this right... Brostrom Repair Right Ankle With Gould Modification; Reconstruction Anterior Talofibular Ligament, Retinacular Reefing To Distal Tibia. Sounds like fun, no? I suppose it goes without saying that I didnt sleep too well last night. Although I did exploit the situation by pouring water down my throat each half hour that I got up. As of 5:30 this morning, Im SOL for food and drink. Except to down all my pills. Fingers crossed. Please send liquor and porn for recovery buffers.

 My ankle is gigantic. No, really. I used the grocery cart as a walker in Ralphs just now. I suppose since I took one of the vicodin pills I picked up after seeing my MD, it probably took until now to realize whats actually entailed when I try to get so much done in one day. Thankfully, I have this chance to get this fixed. And then I start thinking this means 6 WEEKS that I cant put weight on it. and an additional TWO MONTHS that I have to walk in an immobilizing brace. This is crazy. Im looking at 3 months of not being able to drive. Me, one who hates to ask for help (Id rather cook you dinner while having a seizure than make you bring me water while Im fainting). This is a big deal. I think I tried to pretend its nothing. To get myself to do something about it? I havent smoked herb in so long. Its really strange to have played with it a little to stun the pain. God, it works better than all these stomach-warping pills they prescribe. Then again, Im not used to it. if I have more than one hit, I get weird. Like, I start talking to the television when an ad bothers me. I listen to whos ever with me with the thickest layer of cynicism ever measured in human kind. I mean, when youre forced to hang out with idiots to get the stuff, its hard to have patience with folks who profess the truth of astrology and numerology. And anyway, Im over drugs. Beer is bueno, but all that other crap is bad news. I picked up a couple of films from the schools library to entertain me. since I cant fucking stand television. So so not regretting turning off the cable. Im plenty talented at tuning out with the infinite distractions available online. At least thats interactive. Films: two Ive seen Grand Illusion (Renoir), and Raising Arizona for the pure laughter of it. And one I havent seen: Battle of Algiers. Bryan said its good, so whatever. Looks thrilled with life, yes? What the fuck am I going to do for 3 months?

 god bless having old drug buddies that are still my pals. kegler fucked up his back too, so the both of us were quite a pair the other night hitting the glass. pay no attention to the professionalism i displayed by using only the middle finger and thumb to light it. i swear i didn't get stoned everyday for five years straight. i'm getting all set for the surgery. pre-op - check. foot brace - check. house cleaning of porn and various contraband - well, no check yet. i'm packing. i'm vac-ing. mom will be visiting the condo to care for the kit-kats until i can stand up again on monday. she's no snoop, but this is my private den of iniquity. you never know, and it isn't worth the risk of fielding questions later on.

 Well, now. Thats just the kind of news I need first thing in the morning. Did you know? The number of child suicides in LA County has dropped to only 19 a year from 27? Aint that a silver lining on your morning? As usual, the local NPR station is fuzzy at my house, leaving me to opt for the KBCC affiliate out of the north. However more serious and depressing the news seems to be, at least I can rest assured that its not /my/ traffic report Im listening to. Joint session testimony by the President and VP today before the 911 commission. A bit suspicious that they need to be there at the same time as the other - as if their stories need to be shared together so as not to contradict the facts. I fantasize seeing Bush making surreptitious facial gestures across the room to Cheney to guide his testimony. Winks and little coughs. Bush, the third-base coach, loosening his tie and touching his nose and ears. Hope they dont get their signs mixed up. Pre-Op appointment this morning. Which has to mean Ill be getting my blood drawn. (shudder) Then back up here from La Jolla to Vista to fit my foot with a foxy black boot. No, not patent, knee-high stilettos. I square-ish boxy looking thing, fortified with plastic and whatnot to keep my footsie safe while it heals. Ill be on my back for a few days. And not in a good way. Unless someone wants to come visit and change that. (cough, wink) Ok, I thought I was done for the morning, but Ive yet to get through Morning Edition. Like listening to your senile grandfather talk about a long-ago world that no longer exists, the Pope opened his mouth again. Eyes rolling all across the globe. This time again interfering in the realm of our bodies, speaking out against [Catholic] hospitals who remove feeding tubes to patients who are trapped in a permanently vegetative state. Even if their living wills request it. Euthanasia by Omission I think is the translated tag I heard. Now, if their Idol is a loving being, why are Catholics so concerned about returning to Him? Youd think the eternal afterlife was a housing project in New Jersey. I pray. I pray for the day that religion leaves this land. The world has outgrown its relevance. The Vatican is obsolete, dead as the Latin they speak. (Waiting for the obligatory lightning bolt sounding in the not-so-far distance)

 By the way, I scrounged up over 400 hits on this site so far this month. More strange searches yielded my link: meth addict poetry and another one for naked gardener. Why the naked gardener? Thats not even what I said? And -Why God- is someone looking for such a service. Sheesh. Try the local fag rag in the classifieds section. Am I the only one around who knows how to get a naked boy to cut my lawn? (and be able to choose between cut and uncut) More brouhaha over the right to choose. Im so incredibly offended with the current administration. That we even have to urlLink protest to preserve this right. Will someone please run for office whos fiscally conservative and secular? Ah, the hypocrisy never ends. Whats a concerned citizen to do? God knows it aint me peddling a petition to get on the ballot. Ive got more skeletons in my closet than wait, so even skeletons have internalized homophobia? The air outside tastes of urlLink London . I miss being out there in the world.

 Ice, elevation, mental activity folding in on itself. Too much consciousness the past few days trying to wrap my head around the fretted meeting with the dept chair. She was so gentle though and I know that about her. Yet I worried, and I continue to do so. I had one of those moments today where you think youre crazy and go about unraveling reality from the inside out. What if Im wrong? (Ok, I know Im not) but this is a serious matter. And judging by the way Ive responding to it over the past months, its ridiculous that I let it hurt me so; that I let it fester and turned it in on myself. Like my broken ankle that I waited a month at least to deal with or even have xrayed. Its time that has turned the solidity of what went down into a muddle of woe. Im confident I did the right thing. However painful to revisit in a context like this. Listening to the Cures Lullaby hoping to wind down eventually. Theres so much I feel like I need to take care of and so much of me wanting to stop myself and give it a rest already. I underestimate the stress Im under. If nothing else, my body is helping me to acquire a taste for stasis and silence. I wish Kerri was around to come over and share my bed. Sweet KerriLou and her beautiful feet and toes and her wonderful skin. So beautiful together we were. urlLink So Beautiful Together.jpg This song always makes me lusty. I invited her to see me graduate but Im not going to be there. There a loss in that. many losses in that. Pain intercedes. My Day of the Dead figurines are staring at me with mocking, teeth-filled mouths of laughter reminding me that the only thing that really matters is my mental and physical health. All the rest of this is petty crap. Being out of work, accumulating debt, missing out on my last two weeks of school, postponing graduation, being gay, gaining weight, living alone Its all being tended to in the order of importance. Think Ill head outside and bask in the moonlight with one more cigarette. The stillness after the windy day is the soothing pause I need. Bless my pals for sending me well wishes for Fridays surgery. Ill send you bloody pictures as soon as possible.

 Oh, the bliss of not having to think. I decided to give myself today as a total break from being responsible (minus kitchen cleaning). and what fruit? Oh, just a whole lot of terrible websites. And some time sitting quietly, trying to plan ahead for the upcoming weeks when I won't be able to walk. Like, more unable to walk than I am currently. Oh, boy.

 I knew talking to someone about that crappy prof would send me into a spell of feeling horrible. There are just so many powerful feelings that I havent been able to let go of. Still havent. part of me wishes Id kept my mouth shut. Part of me wishes I could stay in bed until surgery. The thought of having him confronted because of me is very very troubling. Frightening. Yeah, Im afraid of him. Yep, I'm going back to bed.

 Quite, quite nervous. The vert in my upper back is so tense, I have a tough one trying to use my arms, turn my neck. Troubled sleep woke when I began punching the wall. Yikes. (deep breath) Im taking Incompletes for my two crit lit theory classes. I have enough on my plate, I think, to let some of the unnecessary stress go. Updates as they happen. I should install a tickertape.

 Uh-ma-god. Im going to pay dearly for this. With SPF 45, I went at the rest of the garden project I left unfinished last week. You know, excavating stone in the patio and making them into steps. And digging into the holes they left with a trowel and an almost violent persistence as I shattered through the 90% granite rock soil these new home developers leave in the backyard of their purchasers lots. i busted my knuckle through the gloves. i swear, i look like a boxer the way my right hand is recovering. i have four different incidents that are struggling to heal. Breaking though rock isn't a good idea. Granted, it is a granite quarry. I have to in order to get the job done. Then I went to planting the rest of my ground cover. With gardening gloves on, with my bikini top and boardshorts on. Even a spell of actual ClearChannel radio on in the background (until the ads made me complain out loud, too much for keeping my respect as a sane person from my neighbours. Im done. Im showered. Im about to take pictures of the still unfinished mess I made. Yet my eyes sting, my body exhausted. It topped out at 102F today, and even now at 3:30, its only down to 99. Ill be going to bed early tonight. I was out there for almost two hours. Goddess bless for having beer exist to make this all possible. And Goddess bless the 15 pills I take a day to keep me from doing any more work out there.

 it topped 100'F just now. the weatherbug icon in the toolbar went from black to red. something i've never seen happen. i'm outside doing my homework (all that i can w/o a laptop that i can see the screen with in the sun). yes, i'm wearing sunscreen. all this squishy body to cover? more meat means more chance for sunburn woes. more surface area to worry about. all my professors have offered me the option of an "I" in light of the pending surgery. which, by the way, i'm still waiting to hear on. so glad the weather has a 12% humidity rating, or i'd be in even worse pain. i braved it and went to classes today anyway. just took drugs and winced. like Formo said, "I can't believe you're doing anything ." I agree. tomorrow's a big day. i have until wednesday to turn in a paper that i only outlined this morning during lectures. i think i'll lean on my recently acquired knowledge of Virginia Woolf to tackle papers for other classes. talk about Intentional Fallacy (refute), Formalism, Feminism... i like my headings to rhyme. it's strange. this is the end of my undergraduate life. all the stress of it that has been compounded exponentially by body problems... yet i find myself trying to savor the moments. like moving out of a house to a better place, yet feeling sentimental for your old haunt. even promotion contains an underlying loss. i need to clean my house if i'm to have my head on straight tomorrow when i talk to Cassel. sounds like those two things aren't interrelated, but they are. mental clarity is heavily dependent on environment. loving the heat. i promise not to spend too much time in the yard until i'm fully browned. white to tan doesn't happen in one afternoon.

 Mid 90s and moderate winds. Me in shorts and flips, hoping to slip through the day from one air conditioned vessel to another. Carefully monitoring my mobile phone. For word of surgery scheduling, for verification that I can get in for a massage this week. For shouts of support to get me psyched up for tomorrows purging of the Asshole saga. Seven pills down for breakfast. Ankle hurts to the touch, so Ive opted to kill it with a pink pill. And leave early (like now) to get a parking space closest to the school. The week begins. (deep breath)

 eating greasy chinese out of a red and white box, playing around with things online to reward myself for a long day of workin' it. ankle is throbbing enough to have me pull over on the way home from mom's tonight. i'm still not sure how it is i'm handling all of this in the final couple of weeks of college. i just keep pushing, and it seems to work out.
